In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal\nrecurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation are reflected in the interim financial statements. The results of operations for the period\nended September 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. The interim financial statements should be\nread in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form\n10-K. As discussed further in Note 18, prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date\nof the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from\nthose estimates.\nLong-term Contracts\nSubstantially all contracts at our Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment and certain contracts at our Global Services (BGS) segment are\nlong-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Changes in estimated revenues,\ncost of sales, and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current\nperiod the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a long-term contract’s percentage-of-completion. When the\ncurrent estimates of total sales and costs for a long-term contract, and/or contractual options that are probable of exercise, indicate a loss, a\nprovision for the entire loss is recognized.\nNet cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior periods' revenue and earnings, including certain losses, across all long-term contracts were as\nfollows:\n(In millions - except per share amounts)\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nDecrease to Revenue\n($1,582)\n($2,204)\n($800)\n($1,319)\nIncrease to Loss from operations\n($2,600)\n($3,965)\n($1,252)\n($2,424)\nIncrease to Diluted loss per share\n($4.76)\n($6.70)\n($3.07)\n($4.29)\nNote 2 – Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines\nearnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and\nparticipating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period.

Based on these methods, deferred tax liabilities are assumed to reverse and generate taxable income over the next 5 to 10\nyears while deferred tax assets related to pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are assumed to reverse and generate tax\ndeductions over the next 15 to 20 years. The valuation allowance primarily results from not having sufficient income from deferred tax liability\nreversals in the appropriate future periods to support the realization of deferred tax assets.\nFederal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2018. The Internal Revenue Service is currently auditing the 2018-2020 tax\nyears. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2010-2022 tax years. We believe appropriate\nprovisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.\nAudit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty.

It is reasonably possible that we may incur costs that exceed these\nrecorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or\nthe discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate\nscenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient\ninformation based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of\nremediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At September  30, 2023 and December  31, 2022, the high end of the estimated range of\nreasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $1,017 and $1,058.\nProduct Warranties\nThe following table summarizes changes in product warranty liabilities recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\n2023\n2022\nBeginning balance – January 1\n$2,275 \n$1,900 \nAdditions for current year deliveries\n121 \n143 \nReductions for payments made\n(258)\n(305)\nChanges in estimates\n285 \n355 \nEnding balance – September 30\n$2,423 \n$2,093 \nCommercial Aircraft Trade-In Commitments\nIn conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft, we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers\nthat give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by\nusing both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed\nquarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in\ncommitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the\nagreement, and require advance notice by the customer.\nTrade-in commitment agreements at September  30, 2023 have expiration dates from 2023 through 2029. At September  30, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022 total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,430 and $1,117. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we\nestimated it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling\n$360 and $286 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $360 and $286.\n14\n The following table summarizes changes in environmental remediation liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022.\n\n| Year | Beginning Balance - January 1 | Reductions for Payments Made, Net of Recoveries | Changes in Estimates | Ending Balance - September 30 |\n|------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|\n| 2023 | $752                          | (46)                                          | 149                  | $855                         |\n| 2022 | $605                          | (22)                                          | 171                  | $754                         |\n\nThe table shows that in 2023, the beginning balance on January 1 was $752.

The estimated earliest potential funding dates for\nthese commitments as of September 30, 2023 are as follows:\nTotal\nOctober through December 2023\n$30 \n2024\n2,670 \n2025\n3,011 \n2026\n4,786 \n2027\n2,384 \nThereafter\n3,618 \n$16,499 \nAs of September 30, 2023, all of these financing commitments relate to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have\nconcluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization\nand interest rates, under which funding would be provided.\nOther Financial Commitments\nWe have financial commitments to make additional capital contributions totaling $274 to certain joint ventures over the next five years.\nStandby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds\nWe have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future\nperformance on certain contracts and security agreements. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds\naggregated approximately $4,420 and $5,070 as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\nSupply Chain Financing Programs\nThe Company has supply chain financing programs in place under which participating suppliers may elect to obtain payment from an\nintermediary. The Company confirms the validity of invoices from participating suppliers and agrees to pay the intermediary an amount based on\ninvoice totals. The majority of amounts payable under these programs are due within 30 to 90 days but may extend up to 12 months. At\nSeptember 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, Accounts payable included $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to\nparticipate in these programs. We do not believe that future changes in the availability of supply chain financing would have a significant impact\non our liquidity.\nRecoverable Costs on Government Contracts\nOur final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment\ndemands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where\nappropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings\ncharge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government.\nFixed-Price Contracts\nLong-term contracts that are contracted on a fixed-price basis could result in losses in future periods. Certain of the fixed-price contracts are for\nthe development of new products, services and related technologies. This development work scope is inherently uncertain and subject to\nsignificant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work by us and our suppliers. The operational and\n15\n The table provides a breakdown of commitments as of September 30, 2023, with the total amounts listed for each period. The periods and their corresponding totals are as follows:\n\n- October through December 2023: $30\n- 2024: $2,670\n- 2025: $3,011\n- 2026: $4,786\n- 2027: $2,384\n- Thereafter: $3,618\n\nThe grand total of all these commitments is $16,499. \n\nTable of Contents\ntechnical complexities of fixed-price development contracts create financial risk, which could trigger additional earnings charges, termination\nprovisions, order cancellations, or other financially significant exposure.\nVC-25B Presidential Aircraft\nThe Company’s firm fixed-price contract for the Engineering and Manufacturing Development (EMD) effort on the U.S. Air Force’s (USAF) VC-\n25B Presidential Aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One, is a $4.3 billion program to develop and modify two 747-8 commercial aircraft.\nDuring the year ended December  31, 2022, we increased the reach-forward loss on the contract by $1,452. This year we made progress\ncompleting engineering and production requirements. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss\non the contract by $482 driven by engineering changes to support the build and installation process; the resolution of supplier negotiations; and\nfactory performance related to labor instability. While we have provisioned for all of our anticipated costs to complete the contract, risk remains\nthat we may record additional losses in future periods.\nKC-46A Tanker\nIn 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture, and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers\nas well as priced options for 13 annual production lots totaling 179 aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized nine low rate initial production\n(LRIP) lots for a total of 124 aircraft. The EMD contract and authorized LRIP lots total approximately $24 billion as of September 30, 2023.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $1,374. During the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $245 resulting from factory disruption\nand additional rework due to a supplier quality issue. As of September 30, 2023, we had approximately $160 of capitalized precontract costs and\n$150 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to unexercised future lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future\nperiods.\nMQ-25\nIn the third quarter of 2018, we were awarded the MQ-25 EMD contract by the U.S. Navy. The contract is a fixed-price contract that includes\ndevelopment and delivery of seven aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $890. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased\nthe MQ-25 reach-forward loss by $579. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $68 primarily\ndriven by production and flight testing delays for EMD aircraft. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we increased the reach-\nforward loss by $71 reflecting higher than anticipated production costs to complete EMD aircraft attributable to recent factory performance. Risk\nremains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nT-7A Red Hawk EMD Contract & Production Options\nIn 2018, we were awarded the T-7A Red Hawk program. The EMD portion of the contract is a $860 fixed-price contract and includes five aircraft\nand seven simulators. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded earnings charges of $203 related to the T-7A Red Hawk fixed-\nprice EMD contract, which had a reach-forward loss at December 31, 2022. The production portion of the contract includes 11 production lots for\naircraft and related services for 346 T-7A Red Hawk aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. We expect the first production and\nsupport contract option to be exercised in 2025. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased the reach-forward loss by $552.\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $189 primarily reflecting higher estimated production\ncosts. At September  30, 2023, we had approximately $162 of capitalized precontract costs and $421 of potential termination liabilities to\nsuppliers related to unexercised future lots. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nCommercial Crew\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport\ncrews to the International Space Station. During the second\n16\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nquarter of 2022, we successfully completed the uncrewed Orbital Flight Test. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we increased the\nreach-forward loss by $288. During the second quarter of 2023, we increased the reach-forward loss by $257 primarily as a result of delaying the\ncrewed flight test previously scheduled for July 2023 following notification by a parachute supplier of an issue identified through testing. We\nanticipate being ready to launch in early 2024 and are working with NASA to identify a new launch window. At September 30, 2023, we had\napproximately $191 of capitalized precontract costs and $196 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers related to fixed-price unauthorized\nfuture missions. Risk remains that we may record additional losses in future periods.\nNote 10 – Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk\nWe enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.\nThe following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a “worst-case\nscenario” and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in\nAccrued liabilities.\nMaximum\nPotential Payments\nEstimated Proceeds from\nCollateral/Recourse\nCarrying Amount of\n Liabilities\nSeptember 30\n2023\nDecember 31\n2022\nSeptember 30\n2023\nDecember 31\n2022\nSeptember 30\n2023\nDecember 31\n2022\nContingent repurchase commitments\n$420 \n$514 \n$420 \n$514 \nCredit guarantees\n15 \n45 \n \n$14 \n$27 \nContingent Repurchase Commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of commercial aircraft, we have entered\ninto contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the sold aircraft at a specified price, generally\n10 to 15 years after delivery. Our repurchase of the aircraft is contingent upon entering into a mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of\nadditional new aircraft in the future. The commercial aircraft repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower\nthan the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower\nof the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.\nIf a future sale agreement is reached and a customer elects to exercise its right under a contingent repurchase commitment, the contingent\nrepurchase commitment becomes a trade-in commitment. Our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently\nbecome trade-in commitments.\nCredit Guarantees We have issued credit guarantees where we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that the\noriginal lessee or debtor does not make payments or perform certain specified services. Generally, these guarantees have been extended on\nbehalf of guaranteed parties with less than investment-grade credit and are collateralized by certain assets. We record a liability for the fair value\nof guarantees and the expected contingent loss amount, which is reviewed quarterly. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire through 2036.\nOther Indemnifications In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and\nour BCA facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs\nrelating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may\nbe asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of\nfuture payments under these indemnities. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and\nreasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note 9.\n17\n The table presents financial data related to contingent repurchase commitments and credit guarantees for two different dates: September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The table is divided into three main columns: \"Maximum Potential Payments,\" \"Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/Recourse,\" and \"Carrying Amount of Liabilities.\" \n\nFor contingent repurchase commitments:\n- On September 30, 2023, the maximum potential payments are $420, and the estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse are also $420.\n- On December 31, 2022, the maximum potential payments were $514, and the estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse were also $514.\n\nFor credit guarantees:\n- On September 30, 2023, the carrying amount of liabilities is $14.\n- On December 31, 2022, the carrying amount of liabilities was $27. \n\nTable of Contents\nNote 11 – Debt\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a $3,000 five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2028 and a $800 364-day revolving\ncredit agreement expiring in August 2024. The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of\nany borrowings until August 2025. The legacy three-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2025, which consists of $3,000 of total\ncommitments, and the legacy five-year revolving credit agreement expiring in October 2024, as amended, which consists of $3,200 of total\ncommitments, each remain in effect. As of September 30, 2023, we had $10,000 available under credit line agreements. We continue to be in full\ncompliance with all covenants contained in our debt or credit facility agreements.\nNote 12 – Postretirement Plans\nThe components of net periodic benefit (income)/cost were as follows:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\nPension Plans\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nService cost\n$3 \n$2 \n$1 \nInterest cost\n2,115 \n1,561 \n705 \n$520 \nExpected return on plan assets\n(2,581)\n(2,843)\n(861)\n(948)\nAmortization of prior service credits\n(61)\n(61)\n(20)\n(20)\nRecognized net actuarial loss\n125 \n681 \n42 \n227 \nSettlement/curtailment gain\n(4)\n(4)\nNet periodic benefit income\n($399)\n($664)\n($133)\n($225)\nNet periodic benefit cost included in Loss from operations\n$3 \n$2 \n$1 \nNet periodic benefit income included in Other income, net\n(402)\n(666)\n(134)\n($225)\nNet periodic benefit income included in Loss before income taxes\n($399)\n($664)\n($133)\n($225)\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\nOther Postretirement Plans\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nService cost\n$36 \n$54 \n$12 \n$18 \nInterest cost\n111 \n73 \n37 \n24 \nExpected return on plan assets\n(6)\n(8)\n(2)\n(3)\nAmortization of prior service credits\n(17)\n(26)\n(6)\n(9)\nRecognized net actuarial gain\n(132)\n(83)\n(44)\n(27)\nNet periodic benefit (income)/cost\n($8)\n$10 \n($3)\n$3 \nNet periodic benefit cost included in Loss from operations\n$47 \n$59 \n$16 \n$20 \nNet periodic benefit income included in Other income, net\n(44)\n(44)\n(15)\n(15)\nNet periodic benefit cost included in Loss before income taxes\n$3 \n$15 \n$1 \n$5 \n18\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nNote 13 – Share-Based Compensation and Other Compensation Arrangements\nRestricted Stock Units\nOn February 16, 2023, we granted 327,523 restricted stock units (RSU) to our executives as part of our long-term incentive program. The RSUs\ngranted under this program have a grant date fair value of $214.35 per unit. The RSUs granted under this program will generally vest and settle\nin common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. If an executive terminates employment because of\nretirement, layoff, disability, or death, the executive (or beneficiary) may receive some or all of their stock units depending on certain age and\nservice conditions. In all other cases, the RSUs will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.\nPerformance Restricted Stock Units\nOn February 16, 2023, we granted 195,526 performance restricted stock units (PRSU) to our elected executive officers as part of our long-term\nincentive program. The PRSUs granted under this program have a grant date fair value of $214.35 per unit. The award payout can range from\n0% to 200% of the initial PRSU grant based on cumulative free cash flow achievement over the period January 1, 2023 through December 31,\n2025 as compared to goals set at the start of the performance period.

We use foreign\ncurrency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain expected sales and purchases through 2031. We use commodity\nderivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments and swaps to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for commodities used\nin production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2028.\nDerivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment\nWe have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and non-U.S. business\nrequirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and\nare priced at prevailing market prices.

The data is categorized under \"Recognized in Other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of taxes,\" which includes two subcategories: Foreign exchange contracts and Commodity contracts.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the foreign exchange contracts resulted in a loss of $30, while in 2022, the loss was significantly higher at $186. In contrast, the commodity contracts showed a loss of $30 in 2023, compared to a gain of $29 in 2022.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2023, the foreign exchange contracts incurred a loss of $41, whereas in 2022, the loss was $82. The commodity contracts for this period showed a gain of $6 in 2023, compared to a loss of $1 in 2022. \n\nTable of Contents\nGains/(losses) associated with our hedging transactions and forward points reclassified from AOCI to earnings are presented in the following\ntable:\nNine months ended September\n30\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nForeign exchange contracts\nRevenues\n$1 \n$1 \nCosts and expenses\n($11)\n9 \n($5)\n(1)\nGeneral and administrative expense\n(21)\n(14)\n2 \n(7)\nCommodity contracts\nCosts and expenses\n24 \n18 \n(3)\n11 \nGeneral and administrative expense\n6 \n6 \n1 \n4 \nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2022, we reclassified losses associated with certain cash flow hedges of $50 from AOCI to Other\nincome, net because it became probable the forecasted transactions would not occur. Losses related to undesignated derivatives on foreign\nexchange and commodity cash flow hedging transactions recognized in Other income, net were insignificant for the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and 2022.\nBased on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of $43 (pre-tax) out of AOCI into earnings during the next 12 months.\nWe have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. If we default on our five-year credit facility, our derivative\ncounterparties could require settlement for foreign exchange and certain commodity contracts with original maturities of at least five years. The\nfair value of those contracts in a net liability position at September  30, 2023 was $32. For other particular commodity contracts, our\ncounterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. At September 30, 2023, there was no collateral\nposted related to our derivatives.\n22\n The table presents gains/losses associated with hedging transactions and forward points reclassified from AOCI to earnings for two periods: the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, and the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022.

The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and\nother market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market\ntrends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when\nthe features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the\nexpected net sales price for the aircraft.\nFair Value Disclosures\nThe fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Condensed\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2023\nCarrying\nAmount\nTotal Fair\nValue\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets\nNotes receivable, net\n$283 \n$294 \n$294 \nLiabilities\nDebt, excluding finance lease obligations\n(52,031)\n(47,481)\n(47,481)\nDecember 31, 2022\nCarrying\nAmount\nTotal Fair\nValue\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nAssets\nNotes receivable, net\n$385 \n$403 \n$403 \nLiabilities\nDebt, excluding finance lease obligations\n(56,794)\n(52,856)\n(52,856)\nThe fair values of notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar\nterms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based\non current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our\nindicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet\nrisk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those\narrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits,\ncommercial paper, money market funds, Accounts receivable, Unbilled receivables, Other current assets, Accounts payable and long-term\npayables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their\nfair value at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is\ndetermined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1).\n24\n The table presents the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position for two different dates: September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

However, only Levels 1 and 2 are populated with data, indicating that the fair value measurements are based on observable market data or significant unobservable inputs. \n\nTable of Contents\nNote 17 – Legal Proceedings\nVarious legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. In\naddition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could\nresult or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and\ntreble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or\nsubdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations.\nExcept as described below, we believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government\ndispute and investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Where it is reasonably\npossible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the\namount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the\nreasons why no such estimate can be made.\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019\naccident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In January 2021, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of\nJustice that resolved the Department’s investigation into matters concerning the 737 MAX. We remain subject to obligations under this three-\nyear agreement, including reporting requirements and ongoing oversight by the Department of Justice of the Company’s compliance program.\nWhile we have resolved a number of other investigations and cases related to the 737 MAX, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if\nany, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of the remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents\nand the 737 MAX.\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and\nservices operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to\npromote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based\non Embraer’s failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is\ncurrently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration, which we currently expect to\nbe completed in late 2023 or early 2024.\nNote 18 – Segment and Revenue Information\nSegment results reflect the realignment of the Boeing Customer Financing team and portfolio into the BCA segment during the first quarter of\n2023. Interest and debt expense now includes interest and debt expense previously attributable to Boeing Capital and classified as a component\nof Total Costs and Expenses (\"Cost of Sales\"). Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nOur primary profitability measurement to review a segment’s operating results is Loss from operations. We operate in three reportable segments:\nBCA, BDS, and BGS. All other activities fall within Unallocated items, eliminations and other. See page 7 for the Summary of Business Segment\nData, which is an integral part of this note.\nBCA develops, produces and markets commercial jet aircraft principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. Revenue on commercial\naircraft contracts is recognized at the point in time when an aircraft is completed and accepted by the customer.\nBDS engages in the research, development, production and modification of the following products and related services: manned and unmanned\nmilitary aircraft and weapons systems, surveillance and engagement, strategic defense and intelligence systems, satellite systems and space\nexploration. BDS revenue is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.\n25\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nBGS provides parts, maintenance, modifications, logistics support, training, data analytics and information-based services to commercial and\ngovernment customers worldwide. BGS segment revenue and costs include certain products and services provided to other segments. Revenue\non commercial spare parts contracts is recognized at the point in time when a spare part is delivered to the customer. Revenue on other\ncontracts is generally recognized over the contract term (over time) as costs are incurred.\nThe following tables present BCA, BDS and BGS revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated in a number of ways, such as\ngeographic location, contract type and the method of revenue recognition. We believe these best depict how the nature, amount, timing and\nuncertainty of our revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nBCA revenues by customer location consisted of the following:\n(Dollars in millions)\nNine months ended September 30\nThree months ended September\n30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenue from contracts with customers:\nEurope\n$4,443 \n$2,869 \n$1,050 \n$615 \nLatin America and Caribbean\n629 \n1,586 \n425 \n450 \nAsia\n3,978 \n3,318 \n1,623 \n1,291 \nMiddle East\n2,723 \n1,297 \n1,257 \n209 \nOther non-U.S.\n1,090 \n918 \n212 \n350 \nTotal non-U.S. revenues\n12,863 \n9,988 \n4,567 \n2,915 \nUnited States\n10,435 \n6,680 \n3,260 \n3,317 \nEstimated potential concessions and other considerations to 737\nMAX customers, net\n54 \n16 \n28 \n33 \nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n23,352 \n16,684 \n7,855 \n6,265 \nIntersegment revenues eliminated on consolidation\n68 \n71 \n21 \n38 \nTotal segment revenues\n$23,420 \n$16,755 \n$7,876 \n$6,303 \nRevenue recognized on fixed-price contracts\n100 %\n100 %\n100 %\n100 %\nRevenue recognized at a point in time\n99 %\n99 %\n99 %\n99 %\nBDS revenues on contracts with customers, based on the customer's location, consisted of the following:\n(Dollars in millions)\nNine months ended September 30\nThree months ended September\n30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenue from contracts with customers:\nU.S. customers\n$14,686 \n$12,493 \n$4,348 \n$3,711 \nNon-U.S. customers\n3,501 \n4,488 \n1,133 \n1,596 \nTotal segment revenue from contracts with customers\n$18,187 \n$16,981 \n$5,481 \n$5,307 \nRevenue recognized over time\n99 %\n99 %\n99 %\n99 %\nRevenue recognized on fixed-price contracts\n57 %\n60 %\n54 %\n54 %\nRevenue from the U.S. government\n91 %\n90 %\n94 %\n91 %\nIncludes revenues earned from foreign military sales through the U.S. government.\n(1)\n(1)\n(1)\n26\n The table provides financial data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, with all figures in millions of dollars.

The value in backlog represents the estimated\ntransaction prices on performance obligations to our customers for which work remains to be performed. Backlog is converted into revenue,\nprimarily based on the cost incurred or at delivery and acceptance of products, depending on the applicable revenue recognition model.\nOur backlog at September 30, 2023 was $469,178. We expect approximately 21% to be converted to revenue through 2024 and approximately\n71% through 2027, with the remainder thereafter. There is significant uncertainty regarding the timing of when backlog will convert into revenue\ndue to timing of 737 and 787 deliveries from inventory and timing of entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10.\nUnallocated Items, Eliminations and Other\nUnallocated items, eliminations and other include common internal services that support Boeing’s global business operations and eliminations of\ncertain sales between segments.

Based on our\nreviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial\ninformation for it to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (the\n\"PCAOB\"), the consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022, and the related consolidated statements\nof operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated January 27,\n2023, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the\naccompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of December  31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in\nrelation to the consolidated statement of financial position from which it has been derived.\nBasis for Review Results\nThis condensed consolidated interim financial information is the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws\nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our reviews in accordance with standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying\nanalytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an\naudit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial\nstatements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nOctober 25, 2023\n29\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Share-based plans income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by $39 million\ncompared with the same period in 2022 primarily due to the timing of corporate allocations.\nDeferred compensation expense of $71 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with income of $204 million in the\nsame period in 2022 is driven by broad stock market conditions and changes in our stock price. Deferred compensation income of $25 million for\nthe three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $38 million in the same period in 2022 is primarily driven by broad stock market\nconditions.\nResearch and development expense for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $61 million and $30 million\ncompared with the same period in 2022 due to spending on enterprise product development.\nEliminations and other unallocated items expense for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $43 million and\ndecreased by $195 million, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2022.

This also\ncontributed to the increase in Other income, net in 2023.\nInterest and debt expense for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023 was lower compared with the same period in the prior year\nprimarily as a result of lower debt balances.\nIn August 2022, the President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained provisions effective January 1, 2023, including\na 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, both of which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results\nof operations, financial condition or cash flows. For discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 3 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nTotal Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)\nCost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting\ncosts. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each\ncommercial aircraft program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of\nsales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as\nincurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S.\ngovernment and other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.\nThe following table summarizes cost of sales:\n(Dollars in millions)\nNine months ended September 30\nThree months ended September 30\n2023\n2022\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nCost of sales\n$50,749 \n$44,962 \n$5,787 \n$16,939 \n$16,771 \n$168 \nCost of sales as a % of Revenues\n91.0 %\n96.4 %\n(5.4)%\n93.6 %\n105.1 %\n(11.5)%\nCost of sales for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $5,787 million and $168 million, or 13% and 1%,\nrespectively, compared with the same periods in 2022, primarily due to higher revenues at all three operating segments. Cost of sales as a\npercentage of Revenues decreased during the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with the same periods in 2022\nprimarily due to lower charges on BDS development programs.\n35\n The following table summarizes cost of sales:\n\n| Dollars in millions | Nine months ended September 30 | Three months ended September 30 |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|\n|                     | 2023                           | 2022                            | Change                         | 2023                           | 2022                            | Change                         |\n| Cost of sales       | $50,749                        | $44,962                         | $5,787                         | $16,939                        | $16,771                         | $168                           |\n| Cost of sales as a % of Revenues | 91.0 %                         | 96.4 %                          | (5.4)%                         | 93.6 %                         | 105.1 %                         | (11.5)%                        |\n\nCost of sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, increased by $5,787 million to $50,749 million from $44,962 million in the corresponding period in 2022.

The increase in\ncontractual backlog during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to increases in BCA and BDS backlog. If we remain\nunable to deliver 737 aircraft in China for an extended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10 is further\ndelayed, we may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations.\nUnobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Unobligated backlog\nwas largely unchanged during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\nAdditional Considerations\nThe Continuing Resolution (CR) enacted on September 30, 2023, continues federal funding at fiscal year 2023 appropriated levels through\nNovember 17, 2023. Congress and the President must enact either full-year fiscal year 2024 (FY24) appropriations bills or an additional CR to\nfund government departments and agencies after November 17, 2023, or a government shutdown could result. We rely on the U.S. government\nin various aspects of our defense, commercial, and services businesses.

Since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s\nimports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. We are mitigating import costs through Duty\nDrawback Customs procedures. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft. Boeing has long-standing relationships with our Chinese\ncustomers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains stalled as\neconomic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge.\nBeginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S.\ntrading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. The U.S. has subsequently reached agreements\nwith Mexico, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the European Union to ease or remove tariffs on steel and/or aluminum. We continue to\nmonitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.\nWe are complying with all U.S. and other government export control restrictions and sanctions imposed on certain businesses and individuals in\nRussia. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and export restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government or other\ngovernments, as well as any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers, for any additional\nimpacts to our business.\nSupply Chain We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of global supply chain constraints and labor instability.\nWe and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we\nramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and\ncash flows.\nThe current conflict in Israel and the Gaza Strip has the potential to impact certain of our suppliers, and has already impacted some operations\nfor our airline and lessor customers. We are closely monitoring developments, supporting our employees and customers, and will take mitigating\nactions as appropriate.\nSegment Results of Operations and Financial Condition\nCommercial Airplanes\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nSee Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2022 Annual Report\non Form 10-K for a discussion of the airline industry environment.\n37\n The image contains a single line of text that reads: \"See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the airline industry environment.\" The text is centered on the page, and there is a page number \"37\" at the bottom center of the page.

Backlog excludes options and Boeing customer financing orders as\nwell as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including\nrights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address\ncustomer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and\nschedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.\nBCA total backlog increased from $329,824 million as of December 31, 2022 to $392,105 million at September 30, 2023 reflecting new orders in\nexcess of deliveries and a decrease in the value of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606\nfor inclusion in backlog, partially offset by order cancellations. Aircraft order cancellations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023\ntotaled $11,612 million and primarily relate to 737 and 777X aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments for the nine months ended September 30,\n2023 resulted in an increase to backlog of $17,871 million due to a net decrease of 777X and 737 aircraft, partially offset by an increase in 787\naircraft in the ASC 606 reserve. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may\nexist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether\nit is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If we remain unable to deliver 737 aircraft in China for an\nextended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10 is further delayed, we may experience reductions to backlog\nand/or significant order cancellations.\nAccounting Quantity\nThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative\nnumber of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders.

In April 2023, the Civil Aviation Administration of China released the second\n737 Aircraft Evaluation Report, which was another step toward resuming deliveries. We continue to work with airlines and government officials to\nresume airplane deliveries to customers in China, however, there continues to be uncertainty regarding timing.\n39\n The table provides data on various aircraft programs as of two different dates: September 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

We continue to expect to\ndeliver most of the aircraft in inventory by the end of 2024. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in China and/or ramp up\ndeliveries consistent with our assumptions, our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted.\nIn April 2023, our fuselage supplier notified us that a non-standard manufacturing process was used on two fittings in the aft fuselage section of\ncertain 737-7, 737-8 and 737 military derivative aircraft. There is not a safety of flight issue and the in-service fleet can continue operating safely.\nWhile this impacted deliveries in the second quarter, newly-built aircraft now meet our specifications.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we discovered non-conforming holes in the aft pressure dome of certain 737-7, 737-8 and 737 military\nderivative aircraft. We are working with our fuselage supplier to rework non-conforming fuselages and ensure newly built aircraft meet our\nspecifications. There is not an immediate safety of flight issue and the in-service fleet can continue operating safely. Inspections and rework\nhave begun on completed aircraft and resulted in lower than expected deliveries in the third quarter of 2023.\nThe recent non-conformance has also disrupted and slowed the production of newly built aircraft including the planned transition from 31 per\nmonth to 38 per month, which is now expected by the end of 2023.\nWe are following the lead of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as we work through the certification process of the 737-7 and 737-10\nmodels. We continue to expect the 737-7 to be certified in 2023 with first delivery in 2024. We continue to expect the 737-10 to begin FAA\ncertification flight testing in 2023 with first delivery in 2024. In 2022, we provisioned for the estimated costs associated with safety enhancements\nthat will be required on all new 737 MAX aircraft and previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft one year and three years after the issuance of a type\ncertificate for the 737-10, respectively. We do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience delays in achieving certification and/or\nincorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nSee further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 9 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\n747 Program We completed production of the 747 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and delivery of the last aircraft occurred in February 2023.\nEnding production of the 747 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to the\nprogram's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and\na derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. The commercial program has near break-even gross margins. We are currently producing at\na rate of 3 aircraft per month.\n777 and 777X Programs We are currently producing at a combined production rate of 3 per month for the 777/777X programs.\nWe continue to expect the first delivery of the 777X-9 to occur in 2025. We are working towards Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) which will\nenable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimately be determined by the regulators, and further\ndeterminations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost\nincreases. We launched the 777X-8 freighter during the first quarter of 2022 and continue to expect first delivery in 2027.\nIn April 2022, we decided to pause production of the 777X-9 during 2022 and 2023. We implemented the production pause during the second\nquarter of 2022, and continue to expect abnormal production costs of approximately $1.0 billion that are being period expensed as incurred until\n777X-9 production resumes. We have been gradually restarting the 777X production system and expect all phases to resume during the fourth\nquarter of 2023. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through September 30, 2023 totaled $767 million including $442 million of abnormal costs\nexpensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n40\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nThe 777X program has near break-even gross margins at September 30, 2023. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a\nnumber of factors. These factors include production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further\nproduction rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks\nassociated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in reach-forward losses on\nthe 777X program in future periods.\n787 Program We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered 787 aircraft due to production quality issues, including in our\nsupply chain. We have implemented changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications\nand do not require further inspections and rework. Deliveries were temporarily paused in late February 2023 pending validation of our prior\nanalysis. We received FAA authorization to resume deliveries in March. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, we had approximately\n75 and 100 aircraft in inventory and expect to deliver most by the end of 2024.\nWe are currently transitioning the production rate from 4 per month to 5 per month. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that production\nrates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed\nas incurred. We also determined that the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as\nabnormal production costs. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through September  30, 2023 totaled $2.6  billion and our estimate of total\nabnormal costs increased from $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion in the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to supply chain disruption. We do not expect\nabnormal costs related to abnormally low production rates to continue beyond September 30, 2023, and we expect the remaining abnormal\ncosts related to inspections and rework to be incurred by the end of 2024. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of\nfuture deliveries and production rate changes.\nAdditional Considerations\nThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with\nsuppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as\nthose of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 737 and 787 production issues and associated\nrework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated\nwith meeting development, production and certification schedules. These challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all\ndevelopment aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability\nstandards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or\na material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program\naccounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate\nor other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with\nincreasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition\nof regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and\ndemand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While\nwe believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our\nairplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended,\nwhich could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.\n41\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nDefense, Space & Security\nBusiness Environment and Trends\nUnited States Government Defense Environment Overview\nIn March 2023, the U.S. government released the President's budget request for FY24, which requested $842 billion in funding for the U.S. DoD\nand $27 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The President's budget request does not request funding for F/A-\n18, V-22, or P-8 production aircraft. The P-8 program continues to pursue U.S. and non-U.S. sales opportunities.\nIn addition, there is ongoing uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD, NASA and other government agencies for\nFY24 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to continue to be subject to pressure. Future\nbudget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in\nreductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of\noperations, financial position, and/or cash flows.\nNon-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the\nneed to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe\nand the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At September 30, 2023, 29% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.\nResults of Operations\n(Dollars in millions)\nNine months ended September\n30\nThree months ended September\n30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$18,187 \n$16,981 \n$5,481 \n$5,307 \nLoss from operations\n($1,663)\n($3,656)\n($924)\n($2,798)\nOperating margins\n(9.1)%\n(21.5)%\n(16.9)%\n(52.7 %)\nSince our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and\nmilestone schedules, the operating results of a particular period may not be indicative of future operating results.

The data is measured in millions of dollars.\n\nFor the nine months ended September 30:\n- Revenues for 2023 were $18,187 million.\n- Loss from operations for 2023 was ($1,663) million.\n- Operating margins for 2023 were (9.1)%.\n- Revenues for 2022 were $16,981 million.\n- Loss from operations for 2022 was ($3,656) million.\n- Operating margins for 2022 were (21.5)%.\n\nFor the three months ended September 30:\n- Revenues for 2023 were $5,481 million.\n- Loss from operations for 2023 was ($924) million.\n- Operating margins for 2023 were (16.9)%.\n- Revenues for 2022 were $5,307 million.\n- Loss from operations for 2022 was ($2,798) million.\n- Operating margins for 2022 were (52.7)%. \n\nTable of Contents\nDeliveries of new-build production units, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:\nNine months ended\nSeptember 30\nThree months ended\nSeptember 30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nF/A-18 Models\n16\n11\n3\n3\nF-15 Models\n6\n9\n4\nT-7A Red Hawk\n1\n1\nCH-47 Chinook (New)\n8\n10\n1\n1\nCH-47 Chinook (Renewed)\n7\n6\n3\n2\nAH-64 Apache (New)\n17\n20\n5\n7\nAH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)\n38\n36\n9\n8\nMH-139\n1\n4 \n1\n4\nP-8 Models\n7\n10\n2\n4\nKC-46 Tanker\n4\n9\n3\n1\nCommercial Satellites\n3\n2 \n2\nTotal\n108\n117\n28\n36\nRevenues\nBDS revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $1,206 million compared with the same period in 2022 primarily due\nto lower charges on development programs and higher revenues on space and proprietary programs. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-\nup adjustments for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 were $676 million better than the comparable period in the prior year largely due\nto lower charges on development programs in 2023, partially offset by unfavorable performance on other programs.\nBDS revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $174 million compared with the same period in 2022. Net\nunfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were $540 million better than the\ncomparable period in the prior year primarily due lower charges on development programs, partially offset by the KC-46A Tanker Lot 8 award in\nthe third quarter of 2022.\nLoss From Operations\nBDS loss from operations was $1,663 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $3,656 million in the same period in\n2022 primarily due to a reduction in net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $2,483 million better than the net\nunfavorable impact in the prior year comparable period. The reduction in unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments included $2,983\nmillion related to the five large fixed-price development programs, partially offset by a $500 million increase in net unfavorable cumulative catch-\nup adjustments on the remaining portfolio and lower margins on several programs in 2023 than the comparable period in the prior year. During\nthe nine months ended September 30, 2023, losses incurred on the five development programs totaled $1,446 million compared with $4,429\nmillion in the same period in 2022. Additionally, operations were impacted by continued labor instability, development technical challenges and\nsupply chain disruption across other programs including F-15 and satellites. Results in 2023 were also affected by the $315 million impact of\nsatellite contract discussed below. Higher period expenses also contributed to the loss from operations in 2023.\nBDS loss from operations was $924 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $2,798 million in the same period in\n2022. The year over year decrease reflects a reduction in net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $1,891 million\nbetter than the net unfavorable impact in the prior year comparable period. During the third quarter of 2023, losses incurred on development\nprograms totaled $618 million compared with $2,762 million in the same period in 2022. These reductions were partially offset by lower margins\non several programs including F-15 and satellites\n43\n The table provides information on the deliveries of new-build production units, including remanufactures and modifications, for two time periods: the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022, as well as the three months ended September 30, 2023, and 2022.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the total was 28 units, compared to 36 units in 2022. \n\nTable of Contents\nreflecting continued labor instability, development technical challenges and supply chain disruption. During the three months ended September\n30, 2023, we recorded earnings charges of $315 million resulting from a customer agreement. The charge includes estimated customer\nconsiderations as well as increased costs to enhance the constellation and meet lifecycle commitments.\nSee further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 9 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBDS loss from operations includes our share of earnings from equity method investments of $34 million and $24 million for the nine and three\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 compared with equity earnings of $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and equity loss\nof $38 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022.\nBacklog\nBDS backlog increased from $54,373 million as of December 31, 2022 to $57,802 million at September 30, 2023, primarily due to the timing of\nawards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior periods.\nAdditional Considerations\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs\nhave cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily reduced award or incentive fees, lower\nprofit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based\nMidcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include\nCommercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price\ndevelopment programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during\nthe period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during\ndevelopment, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our\nestimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are\nongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of\nthese programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended,\nwhich could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional\nreach-forward losses in future periods.\n44\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Services\nResults of Operations\n(Dollars in millions)\nNine months ended September 30\nThree months ended September\n30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$14,278 \n$13,044 \n$4,812 \n$4,432 \nEarnings from operations\n$2,487 \n$2,093 \n$784 \n$733 \nOperating margins\n17.4 %\n16.0 %\n16.3 %\n16.5 %\nRevenues\nBGS revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by $1,234 million compared with the same period in 2022 primarily due\nto higher commercial services revenue driven by market recovery across the commercial portfolio.

The $2.5 billion improvement is primarily driven by increases in Advances and progress billings\nin 2023, partially offset by an income tax refund received in 2022.\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $3.0 billion as compared with $0.2\nbillion during the same period in 2022. This improvement was partially offset by an unfavorable change in Accrued liabilities of $3.0 billion,\nprimarily driven by higher accrued losses on BDS fixed-price development programs recorded in the prior year and a $1.5 billion income tax\nrefund received during the third quarter of 2022. Concessions paid to 737 MAX customers totaled $0.3 billion and $1.0 billion during the nine\nmonths ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nPayables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs increased by $0.4 billion during the nine months ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 and decreased by $0.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.

The increase in use of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2023\ncompared to the same period in 2022 is primarily due to net contributions to investments of $4.0 billion in 2023 compared to net proceeds from\ninvestments of $7.4 billion in 2022. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion and $0.9\nbillion. We continue to expect capital expenditures in 2023 to be higher than in 2022.\nFinancing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $5.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared with $1.0\nbillion during the same period in 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net repayments on our debt were $5.1 billion\ncompared with $1.0 billion in the same period in 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2023 the total debt balance was $52.3 billion, down from $57.0 billion at December 31, 2022.

The figures are in millions of dollars.\n\n- **Net loss**: In 2023, the net loss was $2,212 million, while in 2022, it was $4,390 million.\n- **Non-cash items**: For 2023, non-cash items amounted to $3,118 million, compared to $3,436 million in 2022.\n- **Changes in assets and liabilities**: In 2023, changes in assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of $1,673 million, whereas in 2022, the increase was $1,009 million.\n- **Net cash provided by operating activities**: For 2023, this figure was $2,579 million, significantly higher than the $55 million reported in 2022.\n- **Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities**: In 2023, there was a net use of cash amounting to $5,241 million, contrasting with the $6,521 million provided in 2022.\n- **Net cash used by financing activities**: For 2023, this was $5,131 million, compared to $1,016 million used in 2022.\n- **Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents**: In 2023, this effect was a decrease of $22 million, while in 2022, it was a decrease of $134 million.\n- **Net (decrease)/increase in cash & cash equivalents, including restricted**: For 2023, there was a net decrease of $7,815 million, whereas in 2022, there was a net increase of $5,426 million.\n- **Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at beginning of year**: In 2023, this was $14,647 million, starting from $8,104 million in 2022.\n- **Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at end of period**: At the end of the period in 2023, this figure was $6,832 million, down from $13,530 million at the end of 2022. \n\nTable of Contents\nrevolving credit agreement expiring in August 2028 and a $0.8 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2024. The 364-day\ncredit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings until August 2025. The legacy three-year\nrevolving credit agreement expiring in August 2025, which consists of $3.0 billion of total commitments, and the legacy five-year revolving credit\nagreement expiring in October 2024, as amended, which consists of $3.2 billion of total commitments, each remain in effect. We anticipate that\nthese credit lines will remain undrawn and primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.\nOur credit ratings remained unchanged as of September 30, 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, S&P upgraded the outlook on our credit\nrating from negative to stable primarily driven by improving deliveries and expected increases in production. In October 2023, Fitch upgraded our\ncredit rating outlook from stable to positive driven by declining inventory levels, improving production and delivery profile, growing backlog, and\nforecasted positive free cash flow. During the first quarter of 2023, Moody's upgraded the outlook on our credit rating from negative to stable\nprimarily driven by an improvement in operating cash flow and a reduction of 737 and 787 aircraft in inventory.\nWe expect to be able to access capital markets if we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our\nbusiness related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. A number of factors\ncould cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors\ninclude disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, and/or\nassociated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating\ndowngrades. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual\ncommitments.\nAny future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At September 30, 2023, we were in compliance\nwith the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback\ntransactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a\npercentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing\ncapacity.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 10 to\nour Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContingent Obligations\nWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:\nLegal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 17 to our\nCondensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $855 million at\nSeptember 30, 2023. For additional information, see Note 9 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-GAAP Measures\nCore Operating Loss, Core Operating Margin and Core Loss Per Share\nOur unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles\nin the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should\nnot be considered in\n47\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nisolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors\nto review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating loss,\nCore operating margin and Core loss per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\nrepresents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP\nand costs allocated to the business segments. Core loss per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating\npension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit\ncosts other than service cost. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in\naccordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions\nthan GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based\non CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.\nThe Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $663 million and $218 million for the nine\nand three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with benefits of $621 million and $208 million for the same periods in 2022. The higher\nbenefits in 2023 were primarily due to increases in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension expenses included in Other\nincome, net were benefits of $402 million and $134 million for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with benefits of\n$666 million and $225 million for the same periods in 2022. The lower benefits in 2023 were primarily due to higher interest cost and lower\nexpected return on plan assets, offset by lower amortization of net actuarial losses.\nFor further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 24 of our 2022 Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating\nand forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into\noperational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily represent costs driven by market factors and\ncosts not allocable to U.S. government contracts.\n48\n  \n\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP Measures\nThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of Core operating loss, Core operating margin and Core loss per share with the\nmost directly comparable GAAP financial measures of Loss from operations, operating margins and Diluted loss per share.\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\nNine months ended September 30\nThree months ended September\n30\n2023\n2022\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$55,776 \n$46,628 \n$18,104 \n$15,956 \nLoss from operations, as reported\n($1,056)\n($3,174)\n($808)\n($2,792)\nOperating margins\n(1.9)%\n(6.8)%\n(4.5)%\n(17.5)%\nPension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n($663)\n($621)\n($218)\n($208)\nPostretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment \n(200)\n(225)\n(63)\n(71)\nFAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n($863)\n($846)\n($281)\n($279)\nCore operating loss (non-GAAP)\n($1,919)\n($4,020)\n($1,089)\n($3,071)\nCore operating margins (non-GAAP)\n(3.4)%\n(8.6)%\n(6.0)%\n(19.2)%\nDiluted loss per share, as reported\n($3.64)\n($7.24)\n($2.70)\n($5.49)\nPension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(1.10)\n(1.04)\n(0.36)\n(0.35)\nPostretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment\n(0.33)\n(0.38)\n(0.10)\n(0.12)\nNon-operating pension expense\n(0.66)\n(1.13)\n(0.23)\n(0.37)\nNon-operating postretirement expense \n(0.07)\n(0.07)\n(0.02)\n(0.03)\nProvision for deferred income taxes on adjustments \n0.45 \n0.55 \n0.15 \n0.18 \nCore loss per share (non-GAAP)\n($5.35)\n($9.31)\n($3.26)\n($6.18)\nWeighted average diluted shares (in millions)\n605.0 \n594.0 \n607.2 \n596.3 \n FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under\nGAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.
