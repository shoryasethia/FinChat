## LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CO-CHAIRMAN

## Dear Member,

Some of you may recall that in our letter to you two years earlier, we had written, "From the beginning of FY2018 there has been a totally focused drive on eliminating needless layers and unnecessary costs." Last year, too, we reiterated this theme when we wrote, "With changing dynamics of the generics markets, we believe that cost competitiveness will continue to be a key driver. Hence, we aim to continue creating a leaner and more effi cient organization."

Cost competitiveness, de-layering, improving effi ciencies and increasing speed-to-market are continuous processes. These can never stop for any company that seeks to remain on the path of profitable growth. Dr. Reddy's is no exception to this rule.

Your company's strategy is based on three inter-locking and interacting themes. These are:

- · Leadership in chosen spaces
- · Operational excellence and continuous improvement
- · Patient-centric product innovation

How is the strategy bearing out? Last year, we had said that this strategy is getting organization-wide traction and believed that we could be "reasonably optimistic of the prospects for FY2020". We are pleased to inform you that it has, indeed, been the case.

To appreciate this, consider the key financial results for FY2020:

- · Consolidated revenues for FY2020 were ₹ 174.6 billion, or a 13% growth over the previous year. This was on top of an 8% growth in FY2019.
- · Consolidated gross profi t was ₹ 94 billion, which was 13% greater than the previous year. This, too, came over and above a 9% growth in FY2019.
- · Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased to ₹ 46.4 billion, or an increase of 36% compared to the previous year on top of a 42% growth in FY2019.
- · Profi t before taxes (PBT) was ₹ 18 billion, which was 20% lower than ₹ 22.4 billion

earned in the previous year. This was largely on account of impairment charges taken on a set of product intangibles.

- · Profit after taxes (PAT) was ₹ 19.5 billion, versus ₹ 18.8 billion in FY2019 representing a growth of 4%.
- · Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was ₹ 117.40 in FY2020, versus ₹ 113.09 in FY2019.

Let us now touch upon some of your company's businesses.

Revenue from Global Generics in FY2020 was ₹ 138.1 billion, or an increase of 12% compared to FY2019. The growth was driven by impressive performances in Europe, Emerging Markets and India.

Revenue from North America Generics was ₹ 64.7 billion, representing a growth of 8% over FY2019. Pricing pressures continued in this geography. However, we mitigated these by launching 27 new products.

Revenue from Europe increased by 49% to ₹ 11.7 billion - thanks to expansion of the base business, new product launches and scaling up in new geographies such as Italy, Spain and France.

Revenue from Emerging Markets grew by 14% to ₹ 32.8 billion. Each of our key markets - Russia, the CIS countries, Romania and the Rest of the World territories witnessed signifi cant revenue growth.

Revenue from India was ₹ 28.9 billion, or a growth of 11% compared to FY2019. This was due to an increase in both sales volume and price of our existing products, plus additional revenues from the launch of 21 new brands. We also entered the nutrition segment by launching our diabetes nutrition drink 'Celevida'.

Revenue from Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients increased by 7% to ₹ 25.7 billion.

Revenue from Proprietary Products was ₹ 7.9 billion. In FY2020, we sold our US and select territory rights for some products belonging to our neurology franchise.

Your company's path to excelling in the manufacture of complex generics and biosimilars depends on its successful filing for new drugs - be these formulations or active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).

In FY2020, your company filed eight new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). As on 31 March 2020, your company had 99 generic fi lings pending approval from the USFDA, consisting of 97 ANDAs and two New Drug Applications (NDAs). We believe that 30 of these 97 ANDAs have 'First to File' status. In APIs, we fi led 98 Drug Master Files worldwide during FY2020, including 10 fi lings in the US.

Regarding the USFDA observations and warning letters issued relating to our API manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as our oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, we are happy to inform you that these have been successfully resolved with satisfactory USFDA audit closures across all the three facilities.

That brings us to the greatest humanitarian and economic threat facing the globe today - that of the COVID-19 pandemic, which came out of Wuhan in China and spread rapidly across the world.

At the time of writing this letter*, some 6.2 million people have been infected by the virus, and over 370,000 have lost their lives across the world. The US is reeling with over 1.8 million cases; the number of cases has shot up exponentially in Brazil and Russia; and with over 180,000 cases, India now features among the ten worst aff ected nations.

Over and above the sheer humanitarian and health costs that the pandemic has imposed on countries, rich and poor alike, the economic costs are estimated to be phenomenal.

According to the International Monetary Fund's latest World Economic Outlook (April, 2020), global GDP growth is expected to crash by 5.9 percentage points - from 2.9% in CY2019 to -3% in CY2020. It could be worse. For India, growth is estimated to reduce by 5.5 percentage points: from 5% GDP growth in FY2019 to -0.5% in FY2020.

## IN SUCH A TERRIBLE GLOBAL MILIEU, HOW DO WE EXPECT YOUR COMPANY TO PERFORM?

The national lockdown that was imposed in India from 25 March 2020, coupled with similar lockdowns in other countries, led to major disruptions in the supply chain and in logistics. These, plus restrictions on people movement, adversely impacted plant operations. Added to such constraints were restraints on face-to-face meetings with doctors, which is critical for domestic marketing. All these factors challenged the usual manner of doing business.

In large part, we rose to the occasion with timely and proactive initiatives supported by our strong digital infrastructure. Well before COVID-19, we had been working at rapidly

Financial Statements

building various digital platforms not only across our businesses but also with our suppliers, buyers and doctors. Thanks to this digital backbone, we managed to continue most of our business operations despite the initial challenges. Going forward, we will be using our digital channels even more actively to enable working from home and to reach out to doctors, customers and vendors.

Various measures have been undertaken to ensure that our manufacturing operations continue unhampered. Moreover, across all our manufacturing and R&D facilities, offi ces and canteens, we have rigorously imposed social distancing, masks at work and frequent hand sanitizing.

In the initial period, we witnessed two opposite developments. On the one hand, there were incremental sales in certain markets, such as the US, Europe and Russia, thanks to panic buying of medicines. On the other, some of our sales were impacted and deferred in APIs, in the India business and in a few Emerging Markets.

Overall, however, there was no major impact of the pandemic on either in Q4 FY2020 or the full year FY2020.

Equally, there is no denying that we may face many COVID-19 related uncertainties in FY2021. Let us touch upon a few.

First, pharmaceutical players worldwide have been hugely dependent on China for their supply of intermediates and APIs. We believe this will change. Global pharmaceutical majors will want to reduce their dependence on China; and there ought to be more backward integration as companies attempt to establish themselves as end-to-end manufacturers. Here, your company has an advantage, thanks to its signifi cant in-house API facilities.

Second, we expect to see greater outlays in preventive healthcare and for public health emergencies. While that is good for all nations, and especially India where such spends are woefully inadequate, it is not certain how it will directly benefi t pharmaceutical companies, other than hospital equipment suppliers.

Third, if the pandemic continues for another six to eight months as it is expected to, we should be prepared to see increasing delays in the treatment of other diseases. Hospitals and nursing homes all over the world have already begun to push back

admission of non COVID-19 patients. Delays in treating these patients could lead to worsening health conditions, as well as reduced demand for many pharmaceutical products.

Fourth, on the fl ip side, there can be an increased demand for over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. The COVID-19 outbreak has seen a signifi cant upsurge in buying of OTC medicines, especially relating to immunity enhancement, vitamins, analgesics, and fl u and anti-infective medication. This stockpiling is expected to continue in the short-term, and result in demand surges for OTC drugs.

Fifth, in the short-term we will see less face-to-face interaction between medical representatives and doctors. Given its importance, one might witness some negative impact on pharmaceutical sales. Here, we are at an advantage given our strong digital platforms.

Sixth, other than the race for COVID-19 vaccines, one might see some de-prioritization on R&D.

Finally, the pandemic will seriously aff ect medical tourism via travel restrictions. This, in turn, will reduce the consumption of pharmaceutical products across hospitals and selected pharma outlets.

Despite these signifi cant uncertainties, we believe that successful execution of our strategy mentioned earlier - involving leadership in chosen spaces, operational excellence and continuous improvement, and patient-centric product innovation - will create the necessary levers to deal with this uncertain business environment.

Stay safe. Stay healthy.

With our best regards,

## ACCELERATING THE TRANSFORMATION

We remain committed to our purpose, promise, people and the right way of doing business. Aligned with our belief, 'Good Health Can't Wait', we are focusing on three strategic themes to accelerate our transformation journey leadership in chosen spaces, operational excellence and continuous improvement, and patient-centric product innovation.

## Leadership in chosen spaces

## Operational excellence and continuous improvement

To achieve industry-leading growth in our chosen spaces, we are augmenting our capabilities in manufacturing, supply chain and quality by deploying tools and systems, digital technologies and data analytics. These initiatives are improving productivity and building better customer connect, while permeating our culture of quality, compliance, safety, and execution excellence in every function, unit and location of the company.

Even during COVID-19 times, our robust, effi cient and seamless operations enabled us to support our partners and patients uninterruptedly across the world.

We continue to strengthen our market presence and build leadership positions in each of the segments we operate in, with a well-crafted strategy. We are also exploring inorganic growth opportunities to accelerate access to high-quality and aff ordable medicines to patients globally, and, in the process, create value for all our stakeholders.

## Patient-centric product innovation

We have put in place an enhanced R&D and technology-driven platform to address the evolving needs of patients, physicians and caregivers, through the development of innovative products, services and digital business models.

With more than 73 million diabetes patients and another 80 million patients with prediabetes, India likely will become home to the world's largest diabetic population by 2035. More important, 69% of India's diabetes patients have uncontrolled blood sugar levels, despite being on medication. Proper nutrition is essential to helping these patients manage this debilitating disease, protect them from developing diabetes-related problems, and improving their quality of life.

Nutrition transition over the past three decades has resulted in changing eating habits of people, both qualitatively and quantitatively resulting in increased intake of refi ned carbohydrates and decreased intake of protein and fi bre along with the decreased physical activity. This has led to clear nutrition gap in the daily diets. Hence, our India team decided to make a positive impact on the health and quality of life of prediabetes and diabetes patients, in keeping with our belief of 'Good Health Can't Wait.' Last year, we entered the nutrition market with Celevida®, a clinically proven nutrition drink designed for diabetes patients.

Celevida® offers a unique triple benefi t: it manages Postprandial glucose (PPG) or blood-glucose spikes, reduces HbA1C, and supports weight management. It is high in fi bre and protein, with 12 k ey nutrients to boost immunity and helps protect against infections. It contains high-quality slowly digestible carbohydrates, along with essential vitamins and minerals.

To accelerate access to Celevida®, we launched the nutritional drink by sharing it with more than 3,000 healthcare practitioners across India, accompanied by a strong presence in digital and social media channels. A nutritionist outreach program was also developed by engaging 24 nutritionists in key cities throughout the country to increase awareness among diabetes patients regarding the importance of making informed food choices and improve physical-activity habits. The initial response from both doctors and patients has been positive, backed by a strong clinical study program and an attractive nutrition profi le with no added sugar and culturally accepted fl avours like Kesar Elaichi and Green Mango.

## North America Generics -

## Accelerating access to important drugs

<!-- image -->

When the US Congress passed the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017, it created a new pathway for the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to accelerate access to lower-cost generic drugs to doctors and their patients. The pathway, known as a competitive generic therapy (CGT), was designed to expedite the development and review of certain abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) with inadequate generic competition. The CGT designation is awarded to the fi rst generic launch of an off-patent product in the US, and gives 180 days of exclusivity.

Our North America Generics (NAG) group aggressively pursued-and won-the CGT status for two key products - Carboprost Tromethamine Injection USP, and Naloxone Hydrochloride Injection USP. Both the drugs had limited generic competition as defi ned by the USFDA.

In spring 2019, the NAG team spearheaded the launch of Carboprost Tromethamine Injection, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Hemabate® injection. The team's work cut across the gamut of activities-from on-time product filing with a clear filing strategy to assurance of product

shelf life, prompt and on-time execution of the launch, effective request for Pre-Launch Activities Importation Requests (PLAIR) and effective management of securing customer orders. The team worked relentlessly to ensure prompt shipping of the first product, keeping the USFDA informed at every step and ensuring that the CGT status was received prior to launch.

In March 2020, the NAG team received the CGT status again - this time for Naloxone Hydrochloride Injection USP, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Narcan® which is used to treat opioid addiction. We were the second generic to launch a 2mg/2ml pre-filled syringe version of the drug. The NAG team leveraged its relationships with wholesalers and distributors, shipping the product as quickly as possible to areas throughout the country hardest hit by the opioid epidemic.

We believe that accelerating access to good health requires - developing medicines where aff ordable alternatives don't exist, working with all stakeholders in the healthcare systems and ensuring adequate availability of medicines.

The NAG team leveraged its relationships with wholesalers and distributors, shipping the product as quickly as possible to areas throughout the country hardest hit by the opioid epidemic.

Europe -

## Ensuring availability of critical medicines whenever needed

We have established a trusted partnership with hospitals and their buying groups in our fi ve European locations of France , Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK through a strong service culture. We go above and beyond to ensure supply security of critical medicines.

On a Christmas Day, we received a call from a pharmacist of a large hospital in the south of France. The hospital had ordered a critical medicine for a patient in critical need from a warehouse partner, but it did not get delivered. The pharmacist had tried to source the drug from a nearby hospital, but was not successful. Being a drug used to treat a rare disease, no other hospitals had it in stock.

The Christmas holidays are the only time during the year when warehouses take a break and delivery channels get constrained. Our team managed to get another package from the main warehouse and convinced a taxi driver to travel 900 kilometers to deliver the medicine in France.

When the hospital called to confi rm the receipt of the package, our team heaved a sigh of relief. The story also re-emphasizes the impact our medicines have on patients' lives and the responsibility we have to deliver them on time, every time.

In another instance, when Italy became the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Europe, the country's healthcare system got stretched beyond its limits. The lockdown imposed to contain the spread also impacted the supply of critical medicines. Our team in Italy, working from their homes, partnered with several logistics companies specializing in drug deliveries to ensure that products are picked up from our warehouses and delivered to hospitals across the country within 24 hours at no extra cost.

By providing a comprehensive service, as well as a quality product, we are able to ensure vital medicines are available at all times.

## Valsartan -

## Enabling access to safe sartan APIs to customers worldwide

<!-- image -->

Sartans, or Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers (ARBs), are primarily used to treat hypertension (high blood pressure), diabetic nephropathy (kidney damage due to diabetes) and congestive heart failure. At the end of 2018, several ARBs from manufacturers across the globe were found to be contaminated with carcinogenic nitrosamine impurities.

Nitrosamine impurities were formed during the production of sartans and were not detected in routine testing. This led to numerous recalls and consequently a shortage of these medicines for patients worldwide. Many patients are on long-term treatment. A switch to an alternative is not only inconvenient, but also might result in more doctor visits and increased healthcare costs.

Our regulatory and R&D teams proactively assessed the manufacturing processes of our sartan APIs and proved that the

formation of nitrosamine impurities can be avoided by design through our best manufacturing practices. In addition, the team developed and validated highly sensitive analytical methods with a very low limit of detection and quantifi cation to meet the future requirements of regulatory agencies.

To further avoid any potential formation of impurities through raw materials and key starting materials, the assessment also included the control of these sources by backward integration and strategic sourcing partnerships. We have signifi cantly increased our manufacturing capacities for key sartan APIs such as Valsartan, Losartan K and are on track to further enhance these capacities by the end of FY2021. As a result, we were not only able to continuously provide our existing customers with high-quality and safe APIs, but also address the demand of those looking for a trusted source of supply.

We have signifi cantly increased our manufacturing capacities for key sartan APIs such as Valsartan, Losartan K and are on track to further enhance these capacities by the end of FY2021.

Olanzapine -

## Addressing demand for high-quality, aff ordable generics in China

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

China has implemented a series of reforms in the pharmaceutical sector over the years to bring down costs, improve access to new drugs and foster generic competition. In 2017, the country introduced the Quality Consistency Evaluation (QCE) system to ensure that all existing and new generics marketed or manufactured in China meet higher quality standards. Under the new policy, generics companies needed to successfully re-conduct bioequivalent studies to qualify for QCE.

Our team responded with agility and worked relentlessly to meet the new criteria, in line with our commitment to manufacture and market high-quality and affordable medicines. We became the fi rst foreign generics company to receive approval for an existing product,

Olanzapine, under the QCE system. Olanzapine is indicated for the treatment schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

In 2019, China implemented a nationwide generic drug procurement process. Generics companies were asked to submit bids for QCE-qualifi ed drugs to supply to public hospitals across 25 provinces in the country. Driven by our concerted efforts to reach more patients and leveraging our organisational capabilities, we became the fi rst Indian pharma company to win a tender in China under this nationwide drug procurement process. We were granted the rights to supply Olanzapine to public hospitals in eight provinces, which helped us become a partner of choice for medical professionals in China.

We became the fi rst foreign generics company to receive approval for an existing product, Olanzapine, under the QCE system.

## SECTION E PRINCIPLE-WISE PERFORMANCE

PRINCIPLE 1

## ETHICS, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

- 1. Does the policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption cover only the company? Does it extend to the group/joint ventures/suppliers/ contractors/NGOs/others?

Yes. The policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption extends beyond our employees, both whole-time and independent directors and covers our wholly-owned subsidiaries. While contracts with our suppliers, contractors and business partners include adherence to our principles concerning ethics, there is a separate code of conduct required to be adhered to by our suppliers and service providers.

- 2. How many stakeholder complaints have been received in the past fi nancial year and what percentage was satisfactorily resolved by the management?

We have a hotline for receiving concerns from whistle-blowers. The concerns received are dealt with according to our Ombudsperson policy. During the year ended 31 March 2020, we have received and resolved 165 complaints after due investigation.

PRINCIPLE 2

## PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY

- 1. List up to three of your products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/or opportunities.
- i. Lifi tegrast
- ii. Elagolix Sodium
- iii. ROXADUSTAT
- 2. For each such product, provide the following details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of product (optional):

i.

Lifi tegrast

The innovator route to Lifi tegrast involves protection and deprotection strategies that incur costs from additional reagents and waste disposal, and generally leads to increased process mass intensity. Analysis of prior art provided us an opportunity and an improved process was identifi ed by designing

ii.

Elagolix Sodium

We have continued to apply and embed 12 principles of green chemistry in our research and development pursuits. We identifi ed a synthesis of Elagolix Sodium in which a different ligand than the innovator has been employed in the coupling step. This innovative step has enabled us to improve the overall yield from 16% (innovator) to 31%, and there was also a reduction in the number of steps from 10 to 8.

- 3. Does the company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing (including transportation)? If yes, what percentage of your inputs was sourced sustainably?

Yes, we have a well defi ned and documented "supplier code of conduct" for our suppliers, wherein we ensure that our business partners are aware of the code of conduct and follow the same appropriately. The code of conduct addresses all the sustainable sourcing elements, and we have dedicated resources involved, which cater to the vision of sustainable sourcing with special emphasis on capacity building, supplier relationships, and vendor and performance management.

Few of the initiatives have been listed below:

- As a part of a continuous journey, our dedicated team is working for risk mitigation and alternate vendor development program. We have initiated several projects during this fi scal year, which are in various phases of implementation.
- We have been practicing volume consolidation to avoid multiple import part container load shipments. For e.g. for import of

lactose from one of the suppliers based in The Netherlands. We have executed 15 shipments for 29 materials, hence reducing the number of shipments to 50%, thereby reducing the environmental impact due to transportation.

- Lead times and minimum order quantity (MOQ) are pre-defi ned in the system to ensure sea shipments with very minimal requirement of air shipments to address business exigencies leading to a reduction in the green house gases (GHG) emissions.

Ease of doing business: In order to make our suppliers comfortable while doing business with us, we have developed a dedicated portal called Vikreta Connect/Digital P2P portal, which digitizes complete procure to pay process (P2P).

Vikreta has helped in the integration of multiple systems, thereby enabling the smooth flow of the process. It serves as a one stop solution for business partners, providing them better visibility on request for quotations, purchase orders (PO), PO acknowledgement, goods receipt numbers, service entries and payment status.

Vikreta has effi cient invoice management resulting in faster processing of invoices, hence there has been signifi cant improvement in on time payments to business partners. Also, uploading digital invoices has

promoted paperless transactions. Here, business partners can make advance shipment notice before executing dispatches making the operations easy. Also, we have a dedicated team which addresses suppliers' concerns regarding the usability of the portal, which is always functional to address the issues in the fastest possible manner.

Air vs Sea shipment: We have a process in place to monitor the overall air vs sea shipments to maximize the export shipments by sea, and yearly plans are laid-down (market specific targets are assigned) for shifting fi nished goods movement from air to sea.

There has been an increase of 10% in the share of sea shipments in the reporting period as compared to FY2019, contributing 45% in total export shipments in FY2020.

Increase in sea shipments has helped to effectively reduce our carbon emissions by 60,977 tons of CO$\_{2}$ e.

Furthermore, as a part of our strategy to reduce the air shipments, we have initiated clubbing of multiple batches of the injectable products in the active/passive containers that are moved by air. These containers allow the product to be maintained at required 2⁰C to 8⁰C temperature range during the transit. Increasing the utilization of

these containers allowed us to reduce significant air shipment tonnage. To reduce transportation costs, we have been practicing multiple pickups single delivery and also single pick up multiple drops.

- 4. Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services from local & small producers, including communities surrounding their place of work? If yes, what steps have been taken to improve their capacity and capability of local and small vendors?

Yes, small scale industries form a crucial part of our supplier base. We have been making continuous efforts to encourage small vendors by helping, educating and providing them required support to build capacity and supply material to us.

Localization has helped us in better management of inventory, better compliance control and has led to signifi cant reduction in lead time and cost saving along with reduction in carbon footprint due to reduction in transport.

Few of the initiatives taken in this direction include:

- We help local business partners to customize their existing products to meet our product requirements and thus eliminating import shipments.
- In terms of packaging material, procurement from small scale industries has been recorded to be 14.83% of total packaging material procurement.

On the packaging front, in FY2019, the import purchase was 30% of total packaging material procurement cost, which has reduced to 27% in FY2020. The 3% reduction has been contributed by the procurement of major volumes of cotton, desiccants, high density poly ethylene (HDPE) bottles and application pumps.

Increase in sea shipments has helped to effectively reduce our carbon emissions by 60,977 tons of CO$\_{2}$e.

- 5. Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and waste? If yes, what is the percentage of recycled products and waste?

We ambitiously took a target to go for zero solid waste to landfi ll by the end of 2020. For the same, we have taken various initiatives to reuse/recycle the waste.

Total 17,586* tons of hazardous waste was generated during the reporting period. Out of the total hazardous waste generated, 78% of the waste was sent to cement industries for co-processing thereby eliminating offsite incineration. Almost 21.3% waste was sent for recycling.

Thus, 99.3% of hazardous waste was co-processed and recycled. Our API facilities have already achieved zero solid waste to landfill.

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## AS AN INTEGRATED GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL ENTERPRISE, WE OPERATE THROUGH THREE CORE BUSINESS SEGMENTS:

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Global Generics (GG), which includes branded and unbranded prescription medicine as well as over-the-counter (OTC) pharmaceutical products. It also includes the biosimilars business.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI), comprising Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Custom Pharmaceutical Services (CPS).

Proprietary Products (PP), which is mainly composed of the differentiated formulations business, focusing on certain key medical needs.

Through our portfolio of products and services, we operate in multiple therapeutic areas. Of these, the major ones are (i) gastrointestinal, (ii) oncology, (iii) cardiovascular, (iv) pain management, (v) central nervous system (CNS), (vi) respiratory, and (vii) anti-infective.

We are present in several countries across the globe, with the key geographies being the US, Europe, India, Russia, Commonwealth of independent states (CIS) countries, China and other markets.

Continuing the momentum from the last year, FY2020 witnessed robust operational and fi nancial performance for the company, despite pricing pressure challenges that continued

in the US, in Europe, and across certain Emerging Markets. Even so, the company was able to grow across all its businesses, with a significant turnaround in Europe and healthy growth in the branded markets of India, Russia and several other emerging economies. Our North America generics and PSAI businesses also grew, albeit at a lower rate.

Our focus on cost controls, productivity improvements and on creating a leaner and more de-layered business model continued unabated from the previous year. This focus helped improve our profits. Moreover, the financial performance benefited due to depreciation of rupee against the US dollar.

## 'GOOD HEALTH CAN'T WAIT' TRANSLATES TO MEETING OUR FIVE PROMISES

## We leveraged growth momentum across our key branded markets of India, Russia, CIS countries and some other regions.

Improvements in revenue and EBITDA in FY2020 were mainly on account of the following factors.

- 1. Turnaround in the Europe generics business: FY2020 saw a significant growth in the existing geographies as well as in the new markets in Europe. This was driven by an expansion of the base business and new product launches - coupled by the fact that a few key molecules entered the offi cial tenders. Moreover, the temporary supply disruptions that we witnessed last year were resolved in the course of FY2020.
- 2. Continued growth in the branded generics markets: We leveraged growth momentum across our key branded markets of India, Russia, CIS countries and some other regions. Such growth was due to improved base business in these markets and launch of new products.
- 3. Moving ahead on our journey of cost control: We continued making good progress on the journey that began last year to trim cost structures through enhanced productivity and elimination of waste across our businesses. The initiatives that were put in place to drive cost effi ciencies and productivity improvement across manufacturing, procurement, R&D expenditures and marketing spends, played a significant part in improving the financial performance of the company.
- 4. Streamlining our operations towards a leaner business model: Continuing with our strategy of achieving self-sustainability across each of our businesses, streamlining and optimizing global cost structures to create profi table growth for the company, we sold the US and selected territory rights of our commercialized neurology products of the Proprietary Products (PP) business.
- Profit was, however, impacted due to impairment charge taken on certain product intangibles, which will be discussed later.

## A SNAPSHOT OF PERFORMANCE GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

- Revenue from GG in FY2020 was ' 138.1 billion , which represented an increase of 12% compared to the previous year. This growth was largely attributable to impressive performances witnessed in Europe, Emerging Markets and India.
- Revenue from North America generics (NAG) was ' 64.7 billion , with a growth of 8% versus FY2019. This growth was supported by the launch of 27 new products, including four re-launches during the year - the major ones being Daptomycin, Carboprost Tromethamine and Phytonadione (Vitamin K). It should, however, be noted that while there was a healthy growth in the sales volumes of our existing products, this was offset by signifi cant pricing pressures on some of our key products, such as Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual fi lms, Metoprolol and Decitabine Injection.
- In FY2020, we filed eight new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the USFDA . As on 31 March 2020, the company had 99 generic fi lings pending approval from the USFDA - comprising 97 ANDAs and two New Drug Applications (NDAs) filed under the Section 505(b)(2) route of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Of the 97 ANDAs, 54 are Para IV applications, and we believe 30 of these have 'First to File' status.
- Revenue from Europe was ' 11.7 billion , representing a growth of 49% versus FY2019. This was primarily due to expansion of the base business, new product launches coupled with a few key molecules entering tenders, and resolution of the temporary supply disruptions that were witnessed last year. Growth was also aided by the scaling up of our businesses in the new markets of Italy, Spain and France.
- Revenue from Emerging Markets was ' 32.8 billion , with a growth of 14% compared to FY2019. This was largely on account of improvement in our base business performance, new product

- -Revenue from Russia was ' 16.9 billion , representing a year-on-year growth of 10%.
- -Revenue from other CIS countries and Romania was ' 6.5 billion , or an annual growth of 23%.
- -Revenue from Rest of the world (RoW) territories was ' 9.4 billion , or a year-on-year growth of 13%.
- Revenue from India was ' 28.9 billion , which represented a growth of 11% compared to FY2019. This was attributable to an increase in both sales volume and price of our existing products, along with additional revenues from the launch of new products. During FY2020, we launched 21 new brands in India. We also entered the nutrition segment with the launch of our diabetes nutrition drink 'Celevida'.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

- Revenues from PSAI stood at ' 25.7 billion , or a growth of 7% versus FY2019. During the year, we fi led 98 drug master fi les (DMFs) worldwide, including 10 fi lings in the US.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

- Revenue from PP was ' 7.9 billion . This translated to a growth of 67%. During the year, we sold our US and select territorial rights for ZEMBRACE® SYMTOUCH® (sumatriptan injection) 3 mg and TOSYMRA$^{TM}$ (sumatriptan nasal spray) 10 mg, belonging to our neurology franchise.

## GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET OUTLOOK 1

The global pharmaceutical industry has seen an increased use of medicines over the past decade - where the rate of growth of medicine usage has outpaced both population and economic growth. This expansion has been largely on account of the pharmerging markets.

However, the pace of expansion slowed down somewhat in the latter half of the decade, partly due to the decline and stagnation in economic growth in some of the countries, coupled with changes in spending dynamics of consumers.

Revenue from GG in FY2020

' 138.1 billion

## Specialty medicines contribution to global spending by 2024

## 40%

As per the recent IQVIA report, global spending on medicines is expected to surpass US$1.1 trillion by 2024. This can be attributed to the increasing reach of medicines, aided by innovative and specialty offerings bringing newer brands to the market.

Equally, however, overall industry growth is expected to moderate to below 5% by 2024, owing primarily to the slower growth in developed markets, off setting the 5%-8% growth expected in the pharmerging markets.

Specialty medicines currently contribute to 36% of global spending and this share is expected to go up to 40% by 2024. This growth is, and will be, coming from niche areas such as oncology and orphan drugs.

While consumer spend on specialty products in developed markets is expected to reach 52% of total pharmaceutical expenditure in 2024 from 44% currently, such spending in pharmerging markets is expected to be fl at. This would be largely due to high out-of-pocket expenses and delays in marketing of specialty medicines relative to developed markets - often on account of slower adoption rate of such medicines in the pharmerging markets.

While continuing to remain positive, the rate of growth in pharmaceutical spends has seen a steady decrease over the past few years. This has been on account of tighter price controls and the increasing loss of exclusivity by brands, which are being offset by new medicines launched in the market.

New product growth is projected to contribute US$165 billion over the next fi ve years, with around 270 new molecular entities expected to be approved, compared to 236 approved in the last fi ve years. However, declining price, especially in the US, and continued, albeit slower, expansion of older products may off set the gains made from new products.

Over the past few years, there has been an increasing trend across pharmaceutical companies to outsource discovery, development and manufacturing of new products, thus saving capital costs and gaining access to capacity and specialty capabilities which are not routinely available in-house. In this context, contract development and manufacturing organizations (CDMOs) have been providing niche services such as product development and characterization, manufacturing of clinical and commercial APIs and drug products, along with a range of ancillary services including but not limited to clinical, logistical, distribution and regulatory support.

There seems to be a strong correlation between a company's size and its likelihood of outsourcing to one or more CDMO as larger pharmaceutical enterprises are developing alternate sources for supplying APIs for their critical products to ensure minimum supply disruptions.

We foresee strong growth for CDMOs in the coming years on the back of continued growth in the pharmaceutical industry and companies striving to reduce their fi x ed costs through outsourcing their manufacturing activities. On their part, CDMOs are expected to make additional investments to boost their capacities and capabilities in anticipation of future business.

With a renewed global focus on (i) cost and process optimization for manufacturing and distribution functions; (ii) disruptive technologies revolutionizing almost every aspect of reaching patients; and (iii) Artifi cial intelligence (AI) and machine learning promising to provide effi cient solutions for utilizing and deriving value out vast swathes of data, given below are some key trends that we expect to emerge.

- Transforming manufacturing through continuous processing: With increasing focus on bringing economies of scale in manufacturing, more and more companies are investing in continuous processes and fl ow chemistry, as distinct from the erstwhile batch processing techniques. Most global pharmaceutical companies believe that long-term sustainability lies in continuous manufacturing operations. Innovation in new technologies is enabling manufacturers to reduce usage of raw material, automate process development studies and calibration,

and help with micro-dosages and containment. The reduced volumes of raw materials that can be used in fl ow chemistry versus batch processing results in enhanced safety and better economies of scale with lower variable costs.

- Drug pricing reforms and consolidation of generic players in the US: With the presidential elections approaching in 2020, healthcare reforms remain a key policy agenda. As a part of this, several legislative proposals to lower prescription drug prices have been initiated. These include linking of drug prices in the US to international drug pricing, imposing penalties on manufacturers not participating in the drug pricing negotiations with the government, and proposals to establish a federal agency to oversee drug pricing in the US. These pricing pressures have also led to an increasing trend of consolidation among the US generic players.
- Increase in supply chain security through advances in serialization: Under the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), 2013, manufacturers and packagers must enable the tracing of prescription drugs through the entire pharmaceutical supply chain by placing a unique product identifi er on certain prescription drug packages. The objective is to protect consumers from exposure to counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs. With the timelines of the act drawing near, serialization will be a major focus area for pharmaceutical manufacturers and packagers.
- Increased scrutiny of drug manufacturing quality: A key development over the last two years is the increased scrutiny by the USFDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on account of the detection of nitrosamine (NDMA) impurities in certain APIs. NDMA is a probable human carcinogen, and low levels of NDMA are commonly

ingested through food and water levels that are not expected to lead to an increase in the risk of cancer. However, sustained higher levels of exposure may increase the risk of cancer in humans. The impurity was detected mostly in the 'Sartan' family of drugs and also in Ranitidine. Later last year, the USFDA also began investigating the potential of NDMA impurities in the anti-diabetes drug Metformin. It is expected that such scrutiny will expand to other formulations as well and, in the process, redefi ne raw material sourcing, processing conditions and impurity testing parameters for APIs.

- Increasing use of Artifi cial intelligence (AI) for improving clinical trial results: AI has been generating signifi cant interest in clinical trials to increase effi ciency and ensure better outcomes - thereby making the trial results more reliable and less biased. Human clinical trials have been time-consuming, expensive and risky. In this milieu, AI is being leveraged to optimize the use of the data available to generate insight about patients and their clinical journey to effectively and rapidly identify the candidates for trial.

## THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak originated in the commercial center of Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province in China in December 2019, and then spread across the world. On 11 March 2020, after it had infected citizens of several countries around the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) belatedly declared it a global pandemic.

COVID-19 has rapidly spread to over 200 countries and regions. As on 31 May 2020, it infected almost 6.2 million people worldwide (confi rmed infections), and claimed over 370,000 lives. Its spread continues unabated across developed and developing nations alike. It has stretched the healthcare infrastructure of even the most developed nations to almost breaking point, and is expected to cause economic repercussions of the kind not seen since the Great Depression of the 1930s.

Table 1 gives the latest growth forecasts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for 2020.

As of now, there is no approved treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. Till such a treatment comes into being - and is made available across the world at an aff ordable price - the impact on the global and Indian pharmaceutical industry is expected to be significant. Given below are a few key trends that are being anticipated.

- Lower spend on medicines in countries, thanks to the sharp economic downturn: As Table 1 shows, the slump will be severe. This will adversely affect all sectors of the economy, most income earners and government finances.

* Estimates for India are based on those put out by Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Credit Suisse.

In that scenario, there could be adverse impacts on pharmaceutical demand, where increased unemployment and lower disposable income ought to negatively affect consumer spending on healthcare and medicines. Only in some developed markets, where social security measures have helped to relatively insulate healthcare spending from downturns, could one see a limited impact.

- Impact on APIs and generics players with their over-dependence on China: Over the past few decades, India has emerged as a global hub of pharmaceutical products. However, the biggest risk for the industry has been its excess dependence on China for intermediates and APIs. Any significant disruption of this supply chain would lead to a rise in input costs and trigger global price increases for the aff ected products, especially generics. The need for internalization of intermediates and APIs has been long felt by some leading Indian generics companies. Supply chain disruptions of China's API production due to the COVID-19 pandemic have further heightened the need for backward integration of major products. We expect this to be a significant opportunity for Indian pharmaceutical companies to establish themselves as end-to-end manufacturers in the pharma supply chain.
- Increased spending on preventive healthcare and for public health emergencies: Ever since the COVID-19 outbreak, intensive campaigns targeted at personal hygiene have been initiated to prevent its transmission. Similarly, most countries have been found wanting an adequate healthcare infrastructure to deal with such a pandemic. With governments having to face the importance of preventive healthcare and adequate public health infrastructure, we expect that the spending on these will increase significantly in the short to medium term.
- Short term delays in treatment of other medical ailments: With the treatment of COVID-19 patients taking precedence, that of other medical ailments has taken a back-seat. In most cases,

Over the past few decades, India has emerged as a global hub of pharmaceutical products.

the Government ordered lockdowns have signifi cantly reduced footfalls in hospitals and clinics. Patients with other ailments are also reluctant to visit doctors and hospitals for the fear of contracting COVID-19. Besides, to manage limited available capacity, most hospitals are de-prioritizing admission of non COVID-19 cases for surgeries and other treatments. While there has been some use of technology through tele-consultations to address the needs of non COVID-19 patients, this has at best been marginal. In the short term, delays in the treatment of non COVID-19 patients can result in worsening health conditions, as well as in reduced demand for many pharmaceutical products especially in hospitals.

- Increased demand for over the counter (OTC) medicines to mitigate COVID-19 symptoms: After the pandemic outbreak, there has been a signifi cant upsurge in panic-buying of OTC medicines relating to immunity enhancement, vitamins, analgesics and fl u and anti-infective medication. This stockpiling is expected to continue in the short term resulting in short term demand surges of OTC drugs.
- Reduced in-person interactions between medical representatives and doctors: In-person interactions between medical representatives and doctors as well as pharmacists increase product awareness and promote pharmaceutical sales. Such interaction has fallen signifi cantly in most countries after COVID-19 due to government lockdowns as well as restrictions by hospitals and doctors themselves to avoid the spread of infection. Although remote/online interactions have taken precedence, the absence of an in-person interface may lead to a negative impact on pharmaceutical sales.
- Relative de-prioritization of innovation: With some pharmaceutical companies now more concentrated towards developing medication for the treatment of COVID-19, the broader focus on R&D and launch of new products is expected to get de-prioritized and postponed. In addition, while some manufacturers are proceeding normally with respect to the development of life saving drugs, delays in regulatory approvals due to insuffi cient personnel and modifi cations in policies are expected to have an impact on new product launches in the short term.

## Revenue from NAG in FY2020

## ' 64.7 billion

- Impact on medical tourism due to travel restrictions: With most of the countries closing their borders and enforcing travel restrictions, revenues from medical tourism is expected to see a signifi cant dip in 2020. This would reduce the consumption of pharmaceutical products across hospitals and other pharma outlets, impacting revenues.

## OUR MARKET PERFORMANCE, FY2020

NORTH AMERICA GENERICS (NAG) NAG is our largest market. In FY2020, it contributed to around 47% of the company's GG sales, and 37% of overall sales.

Revenue from the region for FY2020 was ' 64.7 billion (US$ 910 million), representing a growth of 8% over the previous year . Even so, the year continued to see signifi cant price erosion due to increased competition across some major products. However, this impact was to a great extent offset by an increase in volumes for some of our base products, and contribution from new product launches - the important ones being Daptomycin, Carboprost Tromethamine and Phytonadione (Vitamin K). Growth was further aided by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Indian rupee. Some key developments were:

- Launched Daptomycin for Injection, a therapeutically equivalent generic version of Cubicin® for Injection, used in the treatment of systemic and life-threatening bacterial infections.
- Launched Carboprost Tromethamine Injection, a therapeutically equivalent generic version of Hemabate® injection, used in cases of an obstetrical emergency of postpartum hemorrhage.
- Launched Phytonadione Injectable Emulsion, a therapeutically equivalent generic version of Vitamin K1, used to treat and prevent unusual bleeding by increasing the body's production of blood clotting factors.
- Gained signifi cant market share in certain key products such as Buprenorphine and Nalox one sublingual fi lm and Metoprolol.

- Filed eight new ANDAs, which comprise some complex products and are across different dosage forms.

Our current priority includes accelerating new product launches and increasing the market share of existing products. The strategy is to signifi cantly expand our portfolio and ensure the right cost structures for our products to be able to compete in this highly competitive market.

We will continue to focus on complex formulations - primarily injectables and oral solid dosage forms - as well as OTC brands in the medium term, and 505(b)(2) generics, controlled substances under class II, and non-substitutable generics in the longer term.

## EMERGING MARKETS

Revenue from Emerging Markets for FY2020 was ' 32.8 billion, representing a growth of 14% compared to the previous year . This signifi cant growth has been on account of increased revenues from our base business, new product launches and scaling up of business in new markets.

Revenue from Russia for FY2020 was ' 16.9 billion, representing a 10% growth over the previous year. The growth was 9% in terms of the local currency (ruble).

In Russia, our key products - such as Nise, Omez, Nasivin, Femibion and Ibuclin were ranked among the top 200 best-selling formulation brands, as per IQVIA in its report for the 12-month period ended 31 March 2020.

Revenue from CIS countries (including Romania) was ' 6.5 billion, representing a 23% increase over the previous year. The growth was led by Ukraine through an increase in the sale of existing products, new product launches and a favorable currency, and supported by growth in Belarus due to new product launches.

In the current fi scal, we emerged as one of the winners for the supply of Olanzapine in the centralized drug procurement tender in China. We were the fi rst Indian company to win a national tender in China.

Revenue from Emerging Markets in FY2020

' 32.8 billion

Revenue from our Rest of the world markets (which includes Brazil, China, South Africa, and certain other markets) was ' 9.4 billion, representing 13% growth over the previous year. This growth was primarily led by scaling up in the new markets such as Brazil, Columbia, Turkey, Chile and Malaysia.

Our focus is to improve market share in the chosen therapy areas through growth in the existing products as well as new product launches.

Our strategy for the Emerging Markets is to build a healthy portfolio pipeline, including expansion of biosimilars and oncology products. We will focus on scaling up in our major markets, which include Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine.

## EUROPE

Revenue from Europe in FY2020 was ' 11.7 billion, representing a growth of 49% vis-a-vis the previous year . This was due to increased revenues in our base markets of Germany and the UK, and was aided by expansion in the new markets of Italy, France and Spain. The increase in revenues was propelled by high volume growth and improvement in supplies, as well as new product launches across all our markets.

Currently, Europe comprises 8% of the company's global generics sales. In the medium to long-term, we expect it to grow by leveraging our in-house portfolio, seeking in-licensing opportunities, and further scaling up business in the three new markets.

## INDIA

Revenue from India in FY2020 was ' 28.9 billion, representing a growth of 11% compared to the previous year . According to the IQVIA in its report for the 12-month period ended 31 March 2020, our growth has been 11.4% versus a market growth of 10.8%. Our market rank as per MAT (March 2020) remains at 13, same as that of last year. Growth in this market has been on account of improvement in the base business performance led by an increase in volumes and price in certain products as well as launch of new products.

During the year, we launched 21 brands in India, including Versavo (the sixth bio-similar from our internal pipeline) and Celevida (our fi rst offering, marking our foray into the nutritional segment), which aided growth.

## Our strategy for the Emerging Markets is to build a healthy portfolio pipeline, including expansion of biosimilars and oncology products.

Eight of our brands (Omez, Omez D, Atarax, Econorm, Nise, Razo D, Stamlo & Ketorol) are in the top 300 brands of the Indian pharmaceuticals market (IPM).

In the near term, we will continue to drive productivity improvement and focus on our core therapeutic areas and big brands. In the medium to long-term, our strategy is to build a healthy pipeline of diff erentiated products in relevant therapies including biosimilars, and expand our presence in new areas such as nutraceuticals.

## PSAI

The PSAI business recorded revenues of ' 25.7 billion in FY2020, representing a 7% growth over the previous year . In FY2020, we fi led 98 DMFs globally, of which 10 were in the US.

This business primarily comprises of APIs and pharmaceutical services. We believe that the recent market developments present us with a good opportunity to expand our API business. We are also focusing on increasing our services business and expect it to be a growth driver.

Our strategy of building a sustainable and growing business involves new product launches and ramping up of base businesses in key geographies. We will also leverage our relationships with key customers by supplying materials that have value addition instead of being 'plain-vanilla' APIs. We aim to be a partner of choice for global generics manufacturers and achieve global leadership through costs and service.

PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP) The PP business recorded revenue of ' 7.9 billion in FY2020, with a growth of 67%. During the current year, we sold the US and select other territorial rights for two of our neurology brands - ZEMBRACE® SMYTOUCH® (sumatriptan injection 3mg) and TOSYMRA™ (sumatriptan nasal spray 10mg). Currently, we do not directly sell any product under this business.

Going forward, our strategy is to focus on advancing the development of the two in-licensed assets - E7777 and PPN-06 - in addition to the in-house pipeline in a well calibrated manner which strives to achieve an optimal balance between risks and costs.

We will focus more on addressing larger unmet needs and bringing a highly selective and focused innovative approach through global development, versus incremental improvement. This should enable the PP business to offer a meaningful presence in the market place. At an overall level, this aligns well with our renewed strategy to enable us to achieve self-sustainability and profitable growth across each of our businesses.

## USFDA OBSERVATIONS: AN UPDATE

It may be recalled that the USFDA had issued a warning letter dated 5 November 2015 relating to good manufacturing practice (cGMP) deviations at our API manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as at our oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.

The contents of the warning letter emanated from Form 483 observations that followed inspections of these three sites by the USFDA in November 2014, January 2015 and February-March 2015, respectively.

Pending resolution of the issues identified in the warning letter, the USFDA withheld approval of new products from these facilities.

After receiving the warning letter, we promptly instituted corrective and preventive actions and submitted a comprehensive response to the USFDA, followed by periodic written updates and in-person meetings. Moreover, to minimize the business impact, we transferred certain key products to alternate manufacturing facilities.

Revenue from India in FY2020

' 28.9 billion

The USFDA subsequently re-inspected these facilities between February and April 2017. The outcomes of these inspections were as follows:

- API facility at Miryalaguda: The USFDA raised three observations in the areas of older methods of validation, improvements in instrument calibration and adherence to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) test methods.
- API facility at Srikakulam: Here, the USFDA raised two observations in (i) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) maintenance, and (ii) the management of soft copies of chromatograms.
- Oncology formulation facility at Duvvada: The USFDA raised 13 observations relating to investigations, batch production records, document controls, general computer systems and environmental monitoring.

Global corrective actions, as well as some specifi c actions, were further implemented. In addition, a detailed response was submitted to the USFDA, which included root cause, corrective actions and preventive actions and impact assessment.

The current status for these sites is as follows:

- API facility at Miryalaguda: In June 2017, the USFDA issued an establishment inspection report (EIR) indicating successful closure of the audit of this facility. This plant was again re-inspected in March 2020; and subsequently, in April 2020 we received an EIR indicating closure of the audit.
- API facility at Srikakulam: In February 2018, the USFDA issued an EIR for this facility indicating that its inspection status remains unchanged, and we were asked to carry out certain detailed investigations and analyses. In response, we submitted the results of such investigations in October 2018. As part of the review of the response by the USFDA, certain additional follow-on queries were received by us. We responded to all queries in January 2019. In February 2019, the USFDA requested answers to three follow-up questions to us; and we responded in March 2019. In January 2020, the USFDA again audited this plant and a Form 483 was issued with fi ve observations. In May 2020, based on our responses and actions taken, the USFDA issued an EIR indicating closure of the audit,

- and the inspection classifi cation of this facility was determined as 'voluntary action indicated' (VAI).
- Oncology formulation facility at Duvvada: In June 2018, the company requested the USFDA to schedule a re-inspection of the oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada. In October 2018, the re-inspection was completed and the USFDA issued Form 483 with eight observations. We responded to these on 20 November 2018. Subsequently, in February 2019, the USFDA issued an EIR indicating the successful closure of the audit of this facility. This plant was again re-inspected in June 2019 and August 2019 and subsequently, we received EIR's for these inspections in September 2019 and February 2020, indicating closure of the audits.

Thus, there have been satisfactory audit closures in all the three facilities.

We remain fully committed to following high standards of quality and to strive towards further strengthening of our quality management systems and processes for sustainability. Our plans to enhance quality management systems and operations include improvements in rigor of investigations and document control systems, standardization of instrument calibrations, strengthening controls with respect to information technology as well as shop fl oor training programs, and simplifying and standardizing standard operating procedures and batch records on the shop fl oor.

The company has initiated additional operational improvements such as shop fl oor supervision and process walk s, engineering, implementation of electronic batch records to eliminate manual errors all with a focus on robustness of processes. We are fully committed to safe and effi cacious products for our patients.

## FINANCIALS

## REVENUE

Total revenue grew by 13% to ' 174,600 million in FY2020. The growth was primarily aided by an increase in volume and new product launches across our businesses and benefi ts due to depreciation of rupee

We remain fully committed to following high standards of quality and to strive towards further strengthening of our quality management systems and processes for sustainability.

against the US dollar, partially off set by price erosion in our GG segment's North America (the US and Canada), Europe and some other Emerging Markets. Growth was also aided by the sale of the US and select territorial rights for two of our neurology brands in the PP segment.

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profi t increased by 13% to ' 94,009 million in FY2020. This resulted in a gross profi t margin of 53.8% in FY2020 representing a decrease of 40 basis points compared to FY2019. The gross profi t margin for GG was 56.8%. The GG gross profi t margin was largely impacted by price erosion in the US and Europe, which was partly offset by new product launches with higher margins, cost optimization initiatives taken by the company, and the depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar. For the PSAI business, the gross profi t margin was 24%. PSAI's gross profi t margin declined primarily on account of the product mix.

## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)

SG&A expenses increased by 3% to ' 50,129 million in FY2020. This was largely attributable to an increase in personnel costs, primarily on account of annual increments, freight outward costs due to increase in volumes, and increases pertaining to depreciation of rupee. These increases were offset by signifi cant efforts and continued focus on cost optimization. SG&A accounted for 28.7% of sales in FY2020 versus 31.6% in FY2019 - or an improvement of 290 basis points over last year.

## R&D EXPENSES

R&D expenses for FY2020 were ' 15,410 million, or 8.8% of revenue, versus 10.1% in FY2019. The absolute and proportional decrease in R&D spends were in line with the productivity improvement measures undertaken by the company, including cost optimization, productivity gains and prioritization of projects. These have

been executed in a manner that does not impinge on building the pipeline of complex generics, biosimilars and diff erentiated products.

## IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLES

In FY2020, there has been an impairment charge of ' 16,757 million, which pertains to charges of:

- a) ' 11,137 million for the product Ethinyl Estradiol/Ethenogestral vaginal ring (generic equivalent to Nuvaring®). During the year, there was a launch of both generic and authorized generic versions of the product, thereby reducing the overall potential of our future cash flows.
- b) ' 4,385 million for products tobramycin inhalation solution, ramelteon tablets 8 mg, and imiquimod cream. While the impairment for tobramycin and ramelteon was triggered by adverse market conditions - such as increased competition and reduced selling prices
- by contestants - the company decided to drop the launch of imiquimod cream.
- c) ' 1,235 million on other products of the GG and PP segment, as the company determined that there was a decrease in the market potential of these products, primarily due to higher than expected price erosion and increased competition leading to lower volumes.

## NET FINANCE INCOME

The net fi nance income was ' 1,478 million in FY2020 versus ' 1,117 million in FY2019.

## NET PROFIT

Net profi t increased by 4% to ' 19,498 million in FY2020. This represents a PAT margin of 11.2% of revenues versus 12.2% in FY2019. Net profi t after tax was higher than the profit before tax largely due to recognition of MAT credit and creation of deferred tax assets, in line with the requirement of accounting standards.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The data are given in Tables 4 and

- 5 . Cash generated from operating activities in FY2020 was ' 29,841 million. Net outfl ow from investing activities amounting to ' 4,923 million in FY2020 includes net investment in property, plant, equipment and intangibles to build capacity and capabilities for future business growth. Cash outfl ow from fi nancing activities was ' 25,159 million. Closing cash and cash equivalents as on 31 March 2020 was ' 1,962 million.

## DEBT-EQUITY

In FY2020, our total borrowings decreased by ' 16,370 million. As on 31 March 2020 the company's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.14 as against 0.27 on 31 March 2019. The net debt-to-equity position was at (0.03) versus 0.09 last year. Table 6 gives the data.

## ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

Our ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- Proactively identify and highlight risks to relevant stakeholders;
- Facilitate discussions around risk prioritization and mitigation;
- Provide a framework to assess appetite;
- Develop systems to warn when the appetite is being breached; and
- Provide an analysis of residual risk.

The ERM team connects with our business units and functions, which are the primary sources for risk identifi cation. It also monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers in the industry. The team collaborates with the compliance, internal audit and other assurance teams to identify and mitigate risks of business units, including risk relating to cyber security.

Our ERM function focuses on the identifi cation of key business, and operational and strategic risks. These are carried out through structured interviews, on-call discussions, or review of incidents.

Risks are aggregated at the unit, function and organization levels and are categorized by risk groups. Our response framework categorizes these risks into (i) internal (preventable), (ii) internal (strategic) and (iii) external risks. The fi nance, investment and risk management (FIRM) council is a management-level committee that helps ERM to prioritize organization-wide risks and steer mitigation efforts in line with our risk appetite.

Mitigation work carried out by the ERM team is periodically reviewed, and progress on key risks is discussed with the FIRM council, our senior management, as well as at the risk management committee of the board of directors. These include (i) updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks; and (ii) specifi c risk-related initiatives carried out during the year.

During FY2020, a review and benchmarking of ERM framework was undertaken. The risk mitigation efforts were focused towards cyber security risk, quality and regulatory risk, compliance and ethics risks, water risks, climate change risks and their mitigation strategies. Efforts were also undertaken in assessing and strengthening data privacy related exposure and other operating risks.

## HUMAN RESOURCES (HR)

In FY2020, the focus was on accelerating the transformation and growth journey that our organization had embarked in FY2019. Several interventions have been made to realign the organization culture, business systems and processes to enable market leading business growth.

At the beginning of FY2019, we revamped our organization banding structure to create a system that was more meritocratic, less hierarchical and progressive. The structure is based on the role-based philosophy where employees are identifi ed by the role they play and growth is viewed more holistically beyond vertical moves.

Several growth bridges were rolled out to provide an ecosystem that enables employees to grow through exposure to different learning experiences. These included the e xtension of our fl agship Young Leaders' program to internal employees, a blended learning journey for developing women leaders (called Chrysalis), exposure to work in areas outside their roles through experiential projects and reverse mentoring.

To execute on our strategy with rigor and deliver consistent results, a Strategy Deployment Process along with Lean Daily Management has been revived as the execution system. Integrated with tools, digital and analytics and leadership behaviors, these will constitute our way of excellence.

## Net Profit in FY2020 ' 19.5 billion

We recently rolled out a simplifi ed and commonly understood framework of leadership behaviors called ASPIRE. This is integrated in our people processes like recruitment, talent assessment and performance management.

We continue to focus on strengthening our talent processes through cadre and capability building interventions. In creating a culture of learning, we have institutionalized programs that incentivize employees to share their expertise, develop managers as coaches and celebrate learning and growth.

Digital capability building and transformation is a key focus area. In our efforts to enhance employee experience, we have digitized several people processes such as recruitment, performance management, and increments. The launch of our fi rst ever digital personal assistant, Amy, and gamified learning through apps have been some early successes in this space.

Diversity and inclusion continue to remain important in the organizational agenda. For the third time, we have been featured in the 2020 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for our commitment to gender equality.

We have also strengthened our eff orts towards actively promoting employment for specially-abled individuals. We signed to the Valuable 500 initiative earlier this year. In this initiative, we committed to get disability inclusion included in our board agenda and undertook a pledge for a 10% increase in employing people with physical disabilities.

## DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

We continue to make progress on our digital transformation journey in line with our planned roadmap. In FY2020, we refreshed our digital strategy and realigned our efforts to:

- a) Digitize the Core: We continue on our journey to Reimagine, Simplify and Digitize all core business processes across the organization. We initiated reimplementation of our ERP system SAP to the latest version S/4 HANA. This project was used as a vehicle to re-engineer processes across the organization, making them

'digital native' and nimble. We also made good progress in extending digitization in functional processes, with platforms like e-Lab Notebook in R&D, manufacturing execution systems (MES), laboratory information management systems (LIMS), document management systems (DMS), customer relationship management (CRM) and others. These are intended to strengthen our process foundations, improve productivity and consistency in execution. We are also applying technologies like robotic process automation on top of this to automate repeatable processes across the value chain.

- b) Data as an Asset: We embarked on a journey (i) to 'Collect' all data internal and external, (ii) to 'Connect' data across processes and systems to make information more meaningful, and (iii) to 'Analyze' by creating insights that help us in generating business value. We are making good progress on our Data Lake journey to make this happen. We have started to see success on our data platforms using artificial

intelligence (AI) based insights in all areas of the value chain. These have helped in faster drug development, improvement in productivity and quality of manufacturing, and personalized connect with our customers. One example is manufacturing, where we are able to use advanced analytics to help in yield optimization, create a golden tunnel for process parameters to generate better quality outcomes and digital dashboards for faster execution.

- c) Platforms to Transform and Win: We have also started to reimagine Dr. Reddy's as a platform-based organization that will bring together capabilities of the entire ecosystem to enhance our value proposition to our partners, customers and patients. For instance, our Vikreta Connect platform now offers not just collaboration with our suppliers but adjacent services like bill discounting to create a win-win partnership. We have identified a few more platforms that are critical to take us on this journey, and believe that these will transform the way in which we interact with our customers, partners and the healthcare ecosystems around the globe.

## OUTLOOK, INCLUDING COVID-19

FY2020 has seen us continuing the improvement of performance in various domains that we embarked upon last year, in spite of the risks and challenges that are inherent to the pharmaceutical industry.

The pricing pressures in the US and Europe have continued. However, our strong performance was led by volume growth and new product launches across our markets. Having said that, some delays in the launch of a few key products hampered even further growth.

Successful closure of the USFDA audits at our three plants reiterate our commitment towards quality.

We continued our journey towards creating a leaner business model, leveraging productivity improvement, cost control and increased effi ciencies across several functions in FY2020. We expect this journey to continue with increased rigor in FY2021, and thus provide the necessary impetus to our performance next year.

We will continue to focus on patient-centric product innovation, operational excellence, continuous improvement and attaining leadership in chosen spaces.

For FY2021, the big questions are: (i) What are we doing about COVID-19? and (ii) How will it affect our business?

In the short run, the national lockdown that was imposed in India from 25 March 2020 coupled with lockdowns in other parts of the world led to signifi cant disruption in the supply chain and logistics. These impacted normal level of plant operations due to restrictions on people movement; created restrictions on the face-to-face meetings

with doctors; impacted the normal level of R&D activities; and, at an overall level, challenged the usual manner of doing business.

We rose to the occasion with timely proactive measures supported by our strong digital infrastructure. Consequently, we have been able to continue most of our business operations despite the initial challenges. We are using digital channels for enabling work from home and reaching out to doctors, customers and vendors. Various initiatives have been undertaken to ensure that our manufacturing related operations continue unabated. In addition, a few products related to COVID-19 are under development.

While we saw some incremental sales in certain markets, such as the US, Europe and Russia, due to an increase in panic buying, our sales also got impacted and/or deferred in PSAI, the India business and few Emerging Markets. On an overall basis, however, there was no major impact on either in Q4 FY2020 or the full year FY2020.

Having said so, we believe FY2021 will have more uncertainties than ever before. Consequently, our overall performance may be quite volatile.

Equally, we remain cautiously optimistic of re-calibrating our levers to suit the new business environment. If we do this successfully, we should be able to come to terms with the new COVID-19 reality. And, if that occurs, we should perform satisfactorily in FY2021.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ('Dr. Reddy's' or 'the company') believes that timely disclosures, transparent accounting policies coupled with a strong and independent board go a long way in maintaining good corporate governance, preserving shareholders' trust and maximizing long-term corporate value. The company's corporate governance framework is based on the following main principles:

- Appropriate composition, diversity and size of the board, with each director bringing in key expertise in diff erent areas.
- Proactive fl ow of accurate information to members of the board and board committees to enable eff ective discharge of fi duciary duties.
- Ethical business conduct by the board, management and employees.
- Well-developed systems of internal controls, risk management and fi nancial reporting.
- Protection and facilitation of shareholders' rights.
- Adequate, timely and accurate disclosure of all material operational and fi nancial information to stak eholders.

In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates corporate governance for listed companies through SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations). We are in full compliance with all the applicable provisions of SEBI's corporate governance norms. We are also in compliance with the appropriate corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE).

This chapter, together with information given in the chapters on Management Discussion and Analysis and Additional Shareholders' Information, constitute our report on corporate governance for 2019-20 (or FY2020).

## BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPOSITION

As on 31 March 2020, our board had 10 directors, comprising (i) two executive directors, including the chairman of the board, and (ii) eight independent directors as defined under the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations and the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Their detailed profi les are given in this annual report.

The directors have expertise in the fields of strategy, management and governance , fi nance , operations, science, technology and human resources. Such expertise enables the board to steer the company in the right direction.

Table 1 gives details of their individual competence, expertise and skills.

The board provides leadership, strategic guidance, objective and independent views to the company's management while discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, thereby ensuring that the management adheres to high standards of ethics, transparency and disclosure. It regularly reviews the company's governance, risk and compliance framework, business plans, and organization structure to align with the highest global standards.

Each director informs the company on an annual basis about the board and board committee positions she/he occupies in other companies, and notifi es it of any changes regarding their directorships and committee positions. In addition, the independent directors provide an annual confirmation that they meet the criteria of independence as defi ned under Indian laws. Pursuant to a notifi cation dated 22 October 2019 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs, all independent directors have completed the registration with the independent directors databank. Requisite disclosures have been received from the directors in this regard. After assessment of such disclosures, declarations and confi rmations, the board has opined that all the independent directors fulfi l the conditions specifi ed under Listing Regulations and are independent of the management.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

During FY2020, the members of the company approved the reappointment of Mr. Sridar Iyengar (DIN: 00278512) and Ms. Kalpana Morparia (DIN: 00046081), independent directors, for a second term of four and fi ve years respectively, under Section 149 (10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Mr. Anupam Puri and Dr. Omkar Goswami ceased to be independent directors of the company on completion of their terms.

Section 152 of the Companies Act, 2013, states that one-third of the board members, other than independent directors, who are subject to retire by rotation, shall do so every year and be eligible for reappointment, if approved by the members. Accordingly, Mr. K Satish Reddy (DIN: 00129701) retires by rotation at the forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM) and, being eligible, seeks reappointment.

Additionally, the board of directors at its meeting held on 20 May 2020 reappointed Mr. G V Prasad,

as whole-time director, designated as co-chairman and managing director of the company (or such other designation as the board may deem fi t), for a further period of fi ve years with effect from 30 January 2021, subject to approval of the members at the forthcoming 36th AGM scheduled on 30 July 2020.

According to the Regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations, a listed entity shall appoint a person or continue the directorship of any person as a non-executive director who has attained 75 years of age only after the concerned company has obtained approval of its members by way of a special resolution.

Mr. Prasad R Menon (DIN: 00005078) an independent director, aged 74 years, will attain the age of 75 years during his present term from 30 October 2017 up to 29 October 2022. Accordingly, the board recommends the continuation of directorship of Mr. Prasad R Menon and seeks the approval of its members by way of a special resolution at the forthcoming 36th AGM under Regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations.

Therefore, at the forthcoming annual general meeting, approval of members is being sought for:

- i. Reappointment of Mr. K Satish Reddy, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for the reappointment.
- ii. Reappointment of Mr. G V Prasad, as whole-time director designated as co-chairman and managing director, for a further period of fi ve years with eff ect from 30 January 2021.
- iii. Continuation of Mr. Prasad R Menon, as an independent director, on attaining the age of 75 years during his present term up to 29 October 2022.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the board is the responsibility of the NGCC of the board, which consists entirely of independent directors. Given the existing composition of the board, the tenure as well as the years left of the existing members to serve on the board, and the need for new domain expertise are reviewed by this committee. When such a need becomes apparent, the committee reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and

professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings in India. It then places the details of shortlisted candidates to the board for its consideration. If the board approves, the person is appointed as an additional director, subject to the approval of members in the company's next general meeting.

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new independent director with the company, an information kit is provided containing documents about the company. It contains, inter alia, information such as its annual reports, sustainability reports, investor presentations, recent press releases, research reports, code of business conduct and ethics (COBE) and the memorandum and articles of association and a brief on company's board practices. The new independent director individually meets with board members and senior management. Visits to plants and research locations are organized for the director to understand the company's operations.

We believe that the board should be continuously empowered with knowledge of latest developments affecting the company and the industry. Apart from regular presentations on the company's business strategies and associated risks, expositions are made on various topics covering the pharmaceutical industry. Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial pronouncements around industry-related laws are regularly circulated to the directors. They also visit the company's manufacturing and research locations. Each director has complete access to any of the company's information and full freedom to interact with senior management.

Details of the familiarization programs for independent directors are available on the company's website: https://www.drreddys.com/media/877371/ familiarization-programs-2020.pdf

## LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Upon their appointment, independent directors are given a formal appointment letter containing, inter alia, the term of appointment, roles, function, duties and responsibilities, the company's code of conduct, disclosures and confidentiality. For such terms and conditions, see: www.drreddys.com/investor/governance/ policies-and-documents/terms-conditiondirectors.html

## BOARD EVALUATION

Since FY2015, the board has carried out an annual self-evaluation of its performance, the working of its committees and peer evaluation of each director internally. Prior to that, on two such occasions, an independent expert was engaged to conduct the evaluation process.

During FY2019, an independent expert was engaged to perform the evaluation and effectiveness process of the board, its committees and individual directors. During FY2020, the evaluation process was undertaken internally.

For the purpose of this year's annual evaluation, each director completed a questionnaire involving peer evaluation and feedback on processes of the board and its committees. The contribution and impact of individual members were evaluated on a number of parameters, such as level of engagement, independence of judgment, conflicts resolution, contributions to enhance the board's overall effectiveness, etc. Peer ratings on certain parameters, positive attributes and improvement areas for each director were provided to them on a confi dential basis.

The committees were evaluated on various parameters such as effective discharge of their roles, responsibilities and advice given to the board for discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, including adequate and periodical updates to the board on the committees' functioning.

We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics ('COBE' or the 'code'), which applies to all directors and employees of the company, its subsidiaries and affiliates. It is the responsibility of all directors and employees to familiarize themselves with this code and comply with its standards. The directors and the employees across the globe annually affirm compliance with the code. A declaration of the CEO of the company to this effect is enclosed as Exhibit 7 to this chapter.

## MANAGEMENT

Our management develops and implements policies, procedures and practices that attempt to translate the company's core purpose and mission into reality.

## MANAGEMENT DISCLOSURES

Senior management of the company (at the role band of yellow and above, as well as certain identifi ed key employees) make annual disclosures to the board on all material, fi nancial and commercial transactions in which they may have personal interest, if any, and which may have a potential confl ict with the interest of the company.

## PROHIBITION OF INSIDER TRADING

We have a policy prohibiting insider trading in conformity with applicable Regulations of the SEBI in India and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the USA. Necessary procedures have been laid down for directors, offi cers, and designated persons for trading in the securities of the company. These are periodically communicated to such employees who are considered as insiders of the company. Apart from this, regular insider trading awareness sessions are conducted for the benefi t of designated persons. Trading window closure/blackouts/quiet periods, when the directors and designated persons are not permitted to trade in the securities of the company, are intimated in advance to all concerned. Violations of the policy, if any, are appropriately acted on and reported to SEBI. The company also maintains a structured digital database, as required under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015.

## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND STATUTORY AUDITS

We have both external and internal audit systems in place. Auditors have access to all records and information of the company. The board recognizes the work of the auditors as an independent check on the information received from the management on the operations and performance of the company. The board periodically reviews the fi ndings and recommendations of the statutory and internal auditors and suggests corrective actions whenever necessary.

## INTERNAL CONTROLS

We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:

- Effectiveness and effi ciency of operations;
- Adequacy of safeguards for assets;
- Reliability of fi nancial and non-financial reporting; and
- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The integrity and reliability of the internal control systems are achieved through clear policies and procedures, process automation, careful selection, training and development of employees and an organization structure that segregates responsibilities. Our internal audit team is an independent, objective assurance and advisory function, responsible for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. The internal audit team helps to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice, and insight. The internal audit team prepares annual audit plans based on risk assessment and conducts extensive reviews covering fi nancial, operational and compliance controls. Areas requiring specialized knowledge are reviewed in partnership with external experts or by recruiting resources with specialised skills. Suggested improvements in processes are identifi ed during reviews and communicated to the management on an ongoing basis.

The audit committee of the board monitors the performance of internal audit team on a periodic basis through review of audit plans, audit findings and speed of issue resolution through follow-ups. Each year, there are at least four meetings in which the audit committee reviews internal audit findings. During the year, the audit committee chairman also met the chief internal auditor without the presence of management.

## CEO AND CFO CERTIFICATION

A certifi cate of the CEO as well as the CFO of the company on fi nancial statements and applicable internal controls as stipulated under Regulation 17(8) of the Listing Regulations is enclosed as Exhibit 8 to this chapter.

The committee ensures that the company's code of business conduct and ethics has a mechanism such that no personnel intending to make a complaint relating to securities and fi nancial reporting shall be denied access to the audit committee.

The audit committee has recommended to the board of directors:

- a) That the audited standalone and consolidated fi nancial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited for the year ended 31 March 2020 prepared as per Ind AS be approved by the board as a true and fair statement of the fi nancial status of the company; and
- b) That the fi nancial statements prepared as per IFRS as issued by International Accounting Standards Board for the year ended 31 March 2020 be approved by the board and be included in the company's annual report on Form 20-F, to be fi led with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

## POSTAL BALLOT DETAILS

During the year, the company provided the facility to its shareholders to cast their votes through remote e-voting, postal ballot and voting conducted through physical ballot paper at the venue of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) convened meeting of the shareholders for obtaining the approval by requisite majority for the Scheme of Amalgamation and Arrangement between Dr. Reddy's Holdings Limited (the 'Amalgamating Company') and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (the 'Amalgamated Company') and their respective shareholders.

Table 9 gives the consolidated voting results of the remote e-voting, postal ballot and voting conducted through physical ballot paper at the venue of the NCLT convened meeting in respect of the resolution for approving the aforesaid Scheme of Amalgamation and Arrangement.

## PERSON WHO CONDUCTED THE POSTAL BALLOT PROCESS

As directed by Hon'ble NCLT, Mr. Amir Ali M. Bavani, Advocate, was appointed as the chairman and Ms. Ranjani Ramesh, Advocate, was appointed as the scrutinizer for the NCLT convened meeting of the equity shareholders for conducting the voting through remote e-voting, postal ballot forms and the voting conducted through physical ballot paper at the venue of the NCLT convened meeting, in a fair and transparent manner.

## PROPOSAL TO CONDUCT POSTAL BALLOT FOR ANY MATTER IN THE ENSUING ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

There is no proposal to conduct postal ballot for any matter in the ensuing annual general meeting.

## PROCEDURE FOR POSTAL BALLOT

In compliance with the Listing Regulations and Sections 108, 110 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, read with applicable Rules, the company provides an e-voting facility to all its shareholders, to enable them to cast their votes electronically. The company engages the services of NSDL for the purpose of providing e-voting facility to all its shareholders. The shareholders have the option to vote either by physical ballot or e-voting.

The company dispatches the postal ballot notices and forms along with self-addressed business reply envelope to its shareholders whose names appear on the register of members/list of benefi ciaries as on a cut-off date. The postal ballot notice is sent to the shareholders in electronic form to the e-mail IDs registered with the DPs/RTA.

Voting rights are reckoned on the paid-up value of the shares registered in the names of the shareholders as on the cut- off date. Shareholders desiring to exercise their votes by physical postal ballot forms are requested to return the forms duly completed and signed, to the scrutinizer on

or before the closing of the voting period. Shareholders desiring to exercise their votes by electronic mode are requested to vote before close of business hours on the last day of e-voting. The last date specifi ed by the company for receipt of duly completed postal ballot forms or e-voting is deemed to be the date of passing of the resolution.

The scrutinizer submits his report to the chairman of the board of directors or any person authorized by him, after the completion of scrutiny, and the consolidated results of the voting by postal ballot are then announced. The results are also displayed on the company's website: www.drreddys.com, besides being communicated to the stock exchanges, depository and RTA.

## DISCLOSURE ON LEGAL PROCEEDINGS PERTAINING TO SHARES

There are three pending cases relating to disputes over title of the shares of the company, in which the company has been made a party. These cases, however, are not material in nature.

## NATIONAL ELECTRONIC CLEARING SERVICE (NECS) FACILITY FOR REMITTANCE OF DIVIDEND ELECTRONICALLY

The company provides the facility for remittance of dividend to shareholders through NECS. Under this facility, shareholders can receive dividend electronically by way of direct credit to their bank account. With this service, problems such as loss of dividend warrants during postal transit/fraudulent encashment are avoided. This also expedites credit of dividend directly to the shareholder's account as compared to the payment through physical dividend warrant. Shareholders are advised to refer the Investor Handbook on the company's website: www.drreddys.com, for further details on how to avail this facility.

## UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS/ INTEREST

Pursuant to Section 125 of the Companies Act, 2013, unclaimed dividend amounts for the FY2012 of ' 7,260,158/- and debenture interest for the FY2013 ' 1,475,571/- has been transferred to the general revenue account of the Central Government/Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF).

The dividends for the FY2013 and bonus debentures redemption amount along with third and fi nal year's interest on debentures for the FY2014 which are unclaimed for seven years will be transferred to IEPF. Table 10 gives the transfer dates in this regard.

Bonus debentures, issued by the company in the year 2011, matured on 24 March 2014. These were redeemed for cash at face value of ' 5/- each along with third and fi nal year's interest.

Shareholders/debenture holders who have not claimed the dividend(s)/interest/ redemption amount are, therefore, requested to do so before they are statutorily transferred to the IEPF.

The shareholders/debenture holders who have not cashed their dividend/interest warrants nor claimed the redemption amount on matured debentures are requested to immediately approach company's RTA, for making payment through electronic bank transfer. In cases, where bank details for making electronic payment are not available, or electronic payment instructions have

## BOARD'S REPORT

Dear Member,

Your directors are pleased to present the 36th annual report for the year ended 31 March 2020.

## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

## COMPANY AFFAIRS*

The company's consolidated total income for the year was ' 181.38 billion, which was up by 15% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this amounted to US$ 2.41 billion. Profi t before taxes (PBT) was ' 18.86 billion, representing a decline of 19% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this translated to US$ 250 million.

The company's standalone total income for the year was ' 125.94 billion, which was up by 16% over the previous year. In US$, this amounted to US$ 1.67 billion. PBT was ' 27.76 billion, which was up by 63% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this translated to US$ 368 million.

Revenues from Global Generics were up by 12% and stood at ' 138.1 billion. There was

growth across North America Generics, Emerging Markets and India, with a strong growth in Europe.

Revenues from North America stood at ' 64.7 billion, registering a year-on-year growth of 8%. This was largely on account of revenue contribution from new products launched, increase in volumes for some of our base products, and favourable foreign exchange movement, partly offset by high price erosions in some of our products.

During the year, the company filed eight abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) in the USA. As of 31 March 2020, there were 99 generic filings awaiting approval with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), comprising 97 ANDAs and two NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2). Of the 97 ANDAs, 54 are Para IV applications, and we believe 30 of these have 'First to File' status.

Revenues from Emerging Markets were ' 32.8 billion, registering a year-on-year growth of 14%. Revenues from India stood at ' 28.9 billion, registering a year-on-year growth of 11%. Revenues from Europe were ' 11.7 billion, registering a year-on-year growth of 49%.

Revenues from PSAI stood at ' 25.7 billion, registering a year-on-year growth of 7%. During the year, the company fi led 10 drug master fi les (DMFs) in the US.

## SCHEME OF AMALGAMATION

During the year, the board of directors approved the scheme of amalgamation of Dr. Reddy's Holdings Limited with the company ("the scheme") subject to the receipt of necessary approvals from statutory authorities, members, creditors and Hon'ble National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Hyderabad. The company has received no-observation letters on 11 October 2019, from the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited on the basis of no comments received from Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). The members and unsecured creditors of the company at the Hon'ble NCLT convened meetings held on 2 January 2020, approved the said scheme with requisite majority. The petition for approval of the said scheme has been filed with the Hon'ble NCLT, Hyderabad Bench on 9 January 2020. The fi nal hearing on the petition is pending.

## DIVIDEND

Your directors are pleased to recommend a dividend of ' 25 (500%) for FY2020, on every equity share of ' 5/-. The recommended dividend is in line with the dividend distribution policy of the company.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone Ind AS financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the Balance sheet as at 31 March 2020, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone Ind AS financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone Ind AS financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2020, its profi t including other comprehensive loss, its cash fl ows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone Ind A S fi nancial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Carrying value of intangible assets, intangible assets under development and goodwill (as described in note 1.3(f) and 1.3 (i) of the significant accounting policies, and note 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 for details and movement in goodwill, other intangible assets and intangible assets under development respectively in the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.
- We assessed the Company's methodology applied in determining the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.

As at 31 March 2020, the Company has ' 6,318 million of intangible assets, ' 277 million of intangible assets under development and ' 323 million of goodwill. The carrying value of these intangible assets are based on future cash flows and there is a risk that the assets may be impaired if cash flows are not in line with projections.

- We assessed the Company's valuation methodology applied in deriving the recoverable value.

Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to management's assessment of recoverable

- We evaluated the assumptions applied to key inputs such as discount rates, sales volume and prices, long term growth rates and terminal values, which included comparing these inputs with assumptions made by the management in prior years.
- amount, being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell, involving significant judgment and are based on number of variables
- We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to previous year / actual performance with management to evaluate whether the inputs and assumptions used in the cash fl ow forecasts were suitable.
- and estimates including projection of future sales, operating costs and profit margins; appropriate discount rate and terminal value growth rate; and probability of technical and regulatory success

factors in applying discounted cash flow valuation methodology.

- We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
- We also assessed the recoverable value headroom by performing sensitivity testing of key assumptions used.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(k) of the significant accounting policies, and note 2.31(A) containing details of contingencies in the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company, assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case-tocase basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation. The aforesaid assessment may result in an incorrect disclosure or provision in the books of account.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the diffi culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the standalone Ind AS financial statements.

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at diff erent levels in the Company, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.
- We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Company's in-house legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We have compared the said evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the standalone Ind AS financial statements. We have tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- We solicited legal letters from the Company's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate we examined correspondences connected with the cases.
- We obtained the details of uncertain tax positions as at the year ended 31 March 2020. We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities. We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of material tax positions and assessed the technical merits of the Company's tax positions based on the correspondence, assessments and settlements from the relevant tax authorities.
- We also evaluated the disclosures in the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

Rebates, discounts, returns etc in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(l) of the significant accounting policies of standalone Ind AS financial statements and note 2.12 of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- We assessed and performed test of controls over the completeness, recognition and measurement of accruals.
- We obtained Management's calculations for accruals and assessed the assumptions used by reference to the company's stated commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts.
- We assessed management analysis of the historical pattern of accruals to validate management's assumption for creation of such provisions.
- We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, where relevant and to current payment trends. We also considered the historical accuracy of the management's estimates in prior years.

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for sales returns, rebates & discounts, etc. The estimates relating to the accruals are important given the significance of revenue and considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate because change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

- We have also performed procedures to test recording of revenue in appropriate period which includes:
- o Performing trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous periods;
- o Verifying sample sales transactions near period-end.

## Other Information

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Statutory reports, Management discussion and analysis, corporate governance and Board's report included in the Annual report, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and Corporate Overview and letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. The other information does not include the standalone Ind AS financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

## Responsibilities of Management for the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone Ind AS financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's fi nancial reporting process.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to fi nancial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signifi cant audit fi ndings, including any signifi cant defi ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2020 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefi ts of such communication.

## ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE IND AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

We have audited the internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company") as of 31 March 2020 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal fi nancial controls based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

## Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind A S fi nancial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated eff ectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone Ind AS financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone Ind AS financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material eff ect on the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE IND AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED (CONTINUED)

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements and such internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind A S fi nancial statements were operating effectively as at 31 March 2020, based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

These financial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective or elected for early adoption at the Company's annual reporting date, 31 March 2020. These financial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on 20 May 2020.

## b) Basis of measurement

These fi nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

- derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;
- fi nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the classification;
- employee defined benefit assets/(liabilities) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for actuarial gains/ (losses) and the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation;
- long-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method;
- assets held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell;
- share-based payments are measured at fair value; and
- right-of-use the assets are recognised at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at that date. This amount is adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs, incurred, if any.

## c) Functional and presentation currency

These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

## d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes:

- Note 1.2 (c) - Assessment of functional currency;
- Note 1.3 (c) - Financial instruments;
- Note 1.3 (d) - Business combinations;

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classifi ed as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always disclosed as non-current.

## f) Prior period

Prior period amounts have been reclassifi ed to conform to the current year classification.

## 1.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## a) New Standards adopted by the Company

Ind AS 116, " Leases "

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) notified Ind AS 116, Leases as part of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces the existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases eff ective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Lessor accounting, however , remains largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and fi nance leases is retained.

The Company adopted Ind AS 116 effective as of 1 April 2019. Ind AS 116, " Leases " changed the financial statements of the Company as the majority of leases for which the Company is the lessee became on-balance sheet liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets also recognised on the Balance sheet. The lease liability reflects the net present value of the remaining lease payments adjusted for payments made before the commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement, and the right-of-use asset corresponds to the lease liability.

Upon adoption of the new standard, a portion of the annual operating lease costs, which was previously fully recognised as a rental / lease expense, is recorded as interest expense. In addition, the portion of the lease payments which represents the reduction of the lease liability is recognised in the cash fl ow statement as an outfl ow from fi nancing activities, which was previously fully recognised as an outfl ow from operating activities.

The Company implemented the new standard on 1 April 2019, and applied the modified retrospective method, with right-of-use assets measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to those leases recognised in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application and will not restate prior years.

The Company elected to use the transition practical expedient that allows the standard to be applied only to contracts previously identified under Ind AS 17, " Leases " and the contracts assessed using the guidance available under Appendix - C to Ind AS 17, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease".

The Company also elected to use the recognition exemption for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option ("short-term leases") and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value ("low value assets").

On 1 April 2019, the Company recognised lease liabilities of ' 332 (presented as part of borrowings) and right-of-use assets of ' 332 (presented as part of Property, plant and equipment).

Consequently, the Company has recognised an amount of ' 173 in depreciation expense and ' 60 in fi nance costs for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Adoption of the new standard had no impact upon leases for which the Company is a lessor.

Appendix C to Ind AS 12, "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments"

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) made certain amendments to Ind AS 12, Income taxes by including Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. This appendix clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of Ind AS 12 are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. It does not apply to taxes or levies outside the scope of Ind AS 12, nor does it specifically include requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax treatments.

Appendix C explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the applicable tax authority. For example, a decision to claim a deduction for a specific expense or not to include a specific item of income in a tax return is an uncertain tax treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under applicable tax law. The interpretation provides specific guidance in several areas where previously Ind AS 12 was silent. Appendix C applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable profi t or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.

The Company applied the interpretation effective 1 April 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of Appendix C did not have any material impact on the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## b) Foreign currency

Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- certain debt instruments classifi ed as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;
- certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value;
- a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is effective; and
- qualifying cash fl ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are eff ective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash flows had occurred at the measurement date.

## c) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant fi nancing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any signifi cant fi nancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind A S 115.

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

- Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI);
- Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profi t or loss (FVTPL); and
- Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the statement of profit and loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A 'debt instrument' is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) The asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch').

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture:

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1 April 2015.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

- The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
- Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a 'simplifi ed approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's fi nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative fi n ancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains or losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as fair value through profi t and loss.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

122

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an exist ing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially diff erent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative financial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative fi nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classified as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as fi nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classified to the statement of profi t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineff ective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash fl ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

## d) Business combinations

In accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 101, First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards , the Company has elected to apply accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations, that occurred on or after 1 April 2009. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the OCI and accumulates the same in equity as capital reserve where there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase else the gain is directly recognised in equity as capital reserve. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

## e) Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income or "Selling and other expense, net" in the statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

124

Goodwill

Other intangible assets

Research and development

Separate acquisition of intangible assets

In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets under development

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                                | Years    |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                  |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                     | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and machinery                        | 5 to 10  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                   | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed as such under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## f) Goodwill and other intangible assets

Recognition and measurement

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of identifi able net assets acquired.

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying value of the equity accounted investee.

Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have fi nite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditures are capitalised only if

- ● development costs can be measured reliably;
- ● the product or process is technically and commercially feasible;
- ● future economic benefi ts are probable and
- ● the Company intends to, and has suffi cient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

The expenditures to be capitalised include the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditures are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred. As of 31 March 2020, none of the development expenditure amounts has met the aforesaid recognition criteria.

Payments to third parties that generally take the form of up-front payments and milestones for in-licensed products, compounds and intellectual property are capitalised. The Company's criteria for capitalisation of such assets are consistent with the guidance given in paragraph 25 of Indian Accounting Standard 38 ("Ind AS 38") (i.e., the receipt of economic benefits embodied in each intangible asset separately purchased or licensed in the transaction is considered to be probable).

Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognised as In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets under development. IPR&D assets are not amortised, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such IPR&D assets is recorded in the statement of profi t and loss under "impairment of non-current assets".

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortisation expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                  | Years   |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles  | 3 to 15 |
| Customer related intangibles | 2 to 5  |
| Other intangibles            | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## g) Leases

As explained in the introduction to this note 1.3(a) above, (see New standards adopted by the Company, Ind AS 116, Leases ), the Company has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Company is the lessee. The new policy is described below. Refer to such introduction to this note 1.3(a) for the impact of the change in accounting policy.

Accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or after 1 April 2019

The Company's accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or after 1 April 2019 are as follows:

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identifi ed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognises a right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

- fi xed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date
- amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees
- the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising that option.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the group, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The Company's lease liabilities are included in borrowings.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to statement of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- any initial direct costs, and
- restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the statement of profi t and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of offi ce furniture.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Company.

Accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or prior to 31 March 2019

The Company's accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or prior to 31 March 2019 are as follows:

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A finance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding lease liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

## h) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and finished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## i) Impairment of non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

## j) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defined contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defined benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defined benefit obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defined benefi t plan, recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in employee benefi t expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

128

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defined benefit obligation and plan assets are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defi ned benefit plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## Termination benefits

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an off er encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefits

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefi ts is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, in the statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss

## k) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the statement of profit and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## l) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates.

Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

| Particulars                                                            | Point of recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales of generic products in India                                     | Upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company.  Control over the generic products is transferred by the Company when the goods are  delivered to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. |
| Sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients  and intermediates in India | Upon delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the  factories of the Company.                                                                                                                               |
| Export sales and other sales outside of  India                         | Upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract  provide for specific revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is  recognised once all such activities are completed.    |

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Profit share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profi t share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signifi cant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition or otherwise. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability the Company also recognises an asset (i.e., right to the returned goods), which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## m) Other income and finance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classifi ed as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities in the statement of cash flows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash fl ow hedges.

## n) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary diff erences:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit;
- temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are off set if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that the future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Current and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgments of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefi t and refl ects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## o) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## p) Government grants

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signifi cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## q) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## r) Rounding of amounts

All amounts in Indian Rupees disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefi ts anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefits.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and inter est cash fl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

Goodwill

Goodwill arising upon business combinations is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Particulars                          |   As at 31 March 2020 |   As at March 2019 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|
| Global Generics-Branded Formulations |                   323 |                323 |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value-in-use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash fl ows for five years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.

Goodwill (continued)

- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used is 10.7% for the cash generating unit. The pre-tax discount rate is 16.2%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

## Details of contract asset:

As mentioned in the accounting policies for refund liability, the Company recognises an asset i.e., right to the returned goods (included in inventories) for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with remeasuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

As on 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, the Company has ' 23 and ' 16, respectively as contract asset representing the right to the returned goods.

- (1) As at 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, 475,575 and 272,700 options, respectively, were excluded from the diluted weighted average number of equity shares calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The average market value of the Company's shares for the purpose of calculating the dilutive effect of stock options was based on quoted market prices for the year during which the options were outstanding.

## 2.24 Employee stock incentive plans

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the Company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split effected in the form of stock dividend issued by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

| Particulars                                                       | Number of options  reserved under  category A   | Number of options  reserved under  category B   | Total     |

| Balance of shares that can be allotted on exercise of options (B) | 205,939                                         | 1,847,685                                       | 2,053,624 |

| Options reserved after stock dividend (A+B+C)                     | 505,939                                         | 3,843,163                                       | 4,349,102 |

The term of the DRL 2002 plan was extended for a period of 10 years effective as of 29 January 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

## Gratuity benefi ts provided by the Company

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a defined benefi t plan which provides for gratuity payments (the "Gratuity Plan") and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund") to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by the Government of India and in debt securities and equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the statement of profit and loss for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 consist of the following:

The Company's average effective tax rate for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 were (5.83)% and 24.90%, respectively.

The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2020 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2019 was primarily on account of:

- recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credits on account of reduction in the MAT rate from 21.55% to 17.47% vide recently enacted Taxation laws (Amendment) Act 2019 for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2020 and subsequent periods.
- recognition of deferred tax asset pursuant to planned restructuring activity between the group companies.
- Non taxability of income from sale of capital assets as it is set off against the carried forward capital loss.

## d) Unrecognised deferred tax assets

| Particulars                                   | As at 31 March 2020   | As at 31 March 2019   |

## e) Deferred tax assets and liabilities

The tax effects of significant temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of the items that created these differences is given below:

| Particulars                           | As at 31 March 2020   | As at 31 March 2019   |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|

| Operating tax loss/capital loss       | 1,651                 | -                     |
| Current liabilities and provisions    | 597                   | 266                   |
| Loans                                 | (65)                  | (65)                  |
| Property, plant and equipment         | (2,331)               | (2,549)               |
| Investments                           | (213)                 | (82)                  |
| Net deferred tax assets/(Liabilities) | 6,129                 | (555)                 |

In assessing whether the deferred tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefits of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

A net gain/loss of ' Nil, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the foreign exchange gain and losses and finance costs. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of statement of profit and loss, a net gain of ' 36 and a net loss of ' 0 for the year ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 respectively.

The Company had outstanding interest swap arrangements that hedged a portion of interest rate risk arising from fl oating rate, dollar denominated foreign currency borrowing of ' Nil and ' Nil as at 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, respectively.

## 2.30 Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in United States dollars, Russian roubles, U.K pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may con tinue to fl uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.29 above.

For the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by ' 4,400 and ' 1,854, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2020, the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows: ' 10,215 of loans carrying a floating interest rates ranging from1 Month LIBOR plus 12.5 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps and ' 4,000 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month India Treasury Bill plus 60 bps. As of 31 March 2019, the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows: ' 10,650 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR plus 25 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profiles, refer note 2.9A and 2.9B of these fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR, Treasury bill) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 27 and ' 27, respectively.

## 2.30 Financial risk management (continued)

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings, interest component of which designated in a cash flow hedge was ' Nil and ' Nil as of 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e, certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2020, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

## b) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

## Details of fi nancial assets - not due, past due and impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2020. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days.

Financial risk management (continued)

## c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ' 20,743 and ' 33,327 respectively.

As at 31 March 2020, the Company had working capital of ' 59,262, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 392, investments in term deposits with banks (i.e., deposits having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 5,003, investments in bonds of ' 1,851, investment in commercial paper of ' 967, investments in marked linked debentures of ' 1,993 and investments mutual funds of ' 11,370.

As at 31 March 2019, the Company had working capital of ' 58,539, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 1,132, investments in term deposits with banks (i.e., deposits having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 513, investments in bonds of ' 5,272, investment in commercial paper of ' 459 and investments in mutual funds of ' 14,900.

## 2.31 Contingent liabilities and commitments

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more significant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case. The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

## (i) Product and patent related matters Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specifi ed product" and fi x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fi xing the maximum selling price.

The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fixed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA fi led a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfl oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fi xing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 11 June 2020 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notifi ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA fi led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application fi led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

## Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had filed, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company filed a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676.

Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to fi le a fi nal counter affi davit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could fi le a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter affi davit was filed by the Union of India. The Company subsequently fi led a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 16 June 2020 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 268 under "Selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were filed against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifically, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plaintiffs in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plaintiffs' right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were filed against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multi product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company filed a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plaintiffs fi led opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was fi led by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the financial statements of the Company.

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafi l finished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and finished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the filing of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. In this regard, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of the said denial was also denied.

The Commercial Court, Hyderabad has accepted the request of the Company to withdraw the suit, in view of the Court granting the Company's motion to file a Counterclaim in the action.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (iii) Securities Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, its Chief Executive Offi cer and its Chief Financial Offi cer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Offi cer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public filings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws, and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were affected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants fi led a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 25 June 2018, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and, on 25 July 2018, a further reply in support of the motion to dismiss was fi led by the Company. In August 2018, oral argument on the motion to dismiss was heard by the Court.

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions.

On 15 May 2020, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., and certain of the Company's current or former directors and offi cers, have entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the "Stipulation") with lead plaintiff the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi in the putative securities class action filed against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. As consideration for the settlement of the class action, the Company has agreed to pay US$ 9 millions. The settlement is subject to the approval of the court and may be terminated prior to court approval pursuant to the grounds for termination set forth in the Stipulation. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the settlement consideration, lead plaintiff and members of the settlement class who do not opt-out of this settlement would release, among other things, the claims that were asserted, or that they could have asserted, in this class action. In entering into the settlement, the defendants do not admit, and explicitly deny, any liability or wrongdoing of any kind.

Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, the settlement resolves the remainder of the litigation.

As the Company is adequately insured with respect to the aforesaid liability, the settlement did not have any impact on the Company's statement of profi t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

The amount payable to the plaintiff s on account of the settlement and the corresponding receivable from the insurer have been presented under "other current financial assets" and "other current financial liabilities", respectively in the balance sheet of the Company as at 31 March 2020.

## (iv) Glenmark Litigation

In November 2017, the Company received a letter from Glenmark Farmaceutica Ltda and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (collectively "Glenmark"), for invocation of arbitration under a distribution agreement and a deed of assignment relating to a product between the Company and Glenmark. Glenmark alleged that the non-supply of the product by the Company severely affected the value of the intellectual property and goodwill and asserted claims to recover the loss along with interest and penalties from the Company.

In March 2018, an arbitrator was appointed by the Supreme Court of India at Glenmark's request. In July 2018, Glenmark filed a claim statement against the Company and in September 2018, the Company fi led a reply against the claim along with a counterclaim.

The Settlement Deed entered into between the parties was confirmed as an arbitral award dated 11 February 2020 by the arbitrator and the issue remains closed.

## (v) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently fi led a review petition against the judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company filed an appeal challenging this judgement.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgement in July 2018 and directed the respondents to fi le their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents filed counter affi davits and the matter has now been adjourned for fi nal hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgement of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued G.O.Ms. No 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded financial year i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019.

During the three months ended September 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") has issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated 24 October 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from financial year 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of the said effected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram.

The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application filed by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from financial year 2016-2017 to 2018- 2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

## 2.31 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5 % as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated 3 August 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G O Ms No 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G O Ms No 31 dated 24 May 2019 and basis the judgement of NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017 for the years 2015-2016 to 2018 -2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2 and CTO-3 of the Company

On 22 November 2019, The Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued an Interim Order which stayed the demand on the condition that the Company deposit ' 60 as the remediation fee for the previous year 2018-2019 payable in the year 2019-2020. The deposit of ' 60 was made and the Interim Order is continuing. The matter was adjourned to 22 April 2020, but has been delayed as a result of the closure of the Court due to the COVID-19 lockdown, and a new date has not yet been rescheduled.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the fi nancial statements.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners that was pending in the National Green Tribunal, (the "NGT"), Delhi.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the NGT. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to the point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notification that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

The appeals filed by Mr. K. Chidambaram against the Orders of the Appellate Authority, Andhra Pradesh are disposed off as the same do not survive for consideration as the G.O. based on which the then APPCB had passed its order which was subject matter of appeal before the Appellate Authority has itself been amended vide order 25 July 2013. However, the NGT, Delhi has passed a direction for the issue of pollution to be considered by the Joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Institute (NEERI), and the Telangana State Pollution Control Board to ascertain the present status of pollution issues in the Medak, Ranga Reddy, Mahaboobnagar and Nalagonda districts in the State of Telangana particularly in the Patancheru and Bollaram industrial clusters and file a report within three months before the NGT, Delhi.

## (vi) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to addit ional fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (vii) Direct taxes related matters

The Company is contesting various disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact for disallowances being more likely than not to be accepted by Tax authorities is ' 2,291, and accordingly, no provision is made in these financial statements as of 31 March 2020.

During the years ended 31 March 2014, 2015 and 2016, Industrias Quimicas Falcon de Mexico, S.A. de CV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico, received a notice from Mexico's Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria ("SAT"), with respect to disallowance on account of transfer pricing adjustments pertaining to the calendar years ended 31 December 2006, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The associated tax impact is ' 686 (MXN 213 millions) and profit share impact is ' 81 (MXN 25 millions). The Company filed administrative appeals with the SAT by challenging these disallowances and, during February and March 2017, the Company received orders of the SAT confirming these disallowances by dismissing its administrative appeals. The Company disagrees with the SAT's disallowances and filed an appeal with the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa (Federal Tax and Administrative Court of Mexico) in March and April 2017.

The Company believes that possibility of any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2020.

## 2.40 Impact of COVID - 19

The threats posed by the coronavirus outbreak are multifold. In many countries, businesses are being forced to cease or limit their operations for long or indefinite period of time. Even in India the outbreak has been declared an epidemic or pandemic and on 24 March 2020, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown, limiting movement of population of India as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result most of the businesses are dealing with lost revenue and disrupted supply chains. The disruption to global supply chains due to factory shutdowns has already exposed the vulnerabilities of many organisations.

However, as the Company operates in the industry that is considered essential, the operations were continuing during lockdown by ensuring appropriate measures.

The Company considered the uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in assessing the recoverability of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. For this purpose, the Company considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these financial statements. The Company has also used the principles of prudence in applying judgements, estimates and assumptions including sensitivity analysis and based on the current estimates, the Company expects to fully recover the carrying amount of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated Ind AS financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Holding Company"), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group") and joint ventures comprising of the Consolidated Balance sheet as at 31 March 2020, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flow and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including a summary of sig nificant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as "the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements").

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other fi nancial information of the subsidiaries, the aforesaid consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, and joint ventures as at 31 March 2020, their consolidated profit including other comprehensive loss, their consolidated cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements for the fi nancial year ended 31 March 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated Ind AS financial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Carrying value of intangible assets, intangible assets under development and goodwil l (as described in note 1.3(g) and 1.3(j) of the significant accounting policies, and note 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 for details and movement in goodwill, intangible assets and intangible assets under development in the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements)

As at 31 March 2020, the Company has ' 15,811 millions of intangible assets, ' 10,987 millions of intangible assets under development and ' 4,913 millions of goodwill. The carrying value of these intangible assets are based on future cash flows and there is a risk that the assets may be impaired if cash flows are not in line with projections.

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.
- We assessed the Group's methodology applied in determining the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
- We assessed the Company's valuation methodology applied in deriving the recoverable value.
- We evaluated the assumptions applied to key inputs such as discount rates, sales volume and prices, long term growth rates and terminal values, which included comparing these inputs with assumptions made by the management in prior years.
- We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to previous year / actual performance with management to evaluate whether the inputs and assumptions used in the cash fl ow forecasts were suitable.
- We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
- We also assessed the recoverable value headroom by performing sensitivity testing of key assumptions used.
- We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies used, and significant assumptions and inputs used to determine the recoverable value of certain intangible assets under development.

Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to management's assessment of recoverable amount, being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell, involving significant judgment and are based on number of variables and estimates including projection of future sales, operating costs and profit margins; appropriate discount rate and terminal value growth rate; and probability of technical and regulatory success factors in applying discounted cash fl ow valuation

methodology.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(l) of the significant accounting policies, and note 2.33 (A) containing details of contingencies in the fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at different levels in the group, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters

- We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Company's in-house legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We have compared the said evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. We have tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a caseto-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation. The aforesaid assessment may

result in an incorrect disclosure or provision in the books of account.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the diffi culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the

amounts involved are, or can be, material to the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

- We solicited legal letters from the Company's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate, we examined correspondences connected with the cases.
- We obtained the details of uncertain tax positions as at the year ended 31 March 2020. We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities. We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of material tax positions and assessed the technical merits of the Company's tax positions based on the correspondence, assessments and settlements from the relevant tax authorities.
- We also evaluated the disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements .

Rebates, discounts and chargebacks, etc. in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(m) of the of the significant accounting policies in the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements and note 2.13 of the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- We assessed and performed test of controls over the completeness, recognition and measurement of accruals.
- We obtained Management's calculations for accruals and assessed the assumptions used by reference to the company's stated commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts.

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for chargeback, rebates, sales returns and discounts, etc. The estimates relating to the accruals are important given the significance

- of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These
- We assessed management analysis of the historical pattern of chargeback rates and the inventory information in order to validate management's assumption for creation of such provisions.
- estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy
- of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.
- We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, where relevant and to current payment trends. We also considered the historical accuracy of the management's estimates in prior years.
- We have also performed procedures to test recording of revenue in appropriate period which includes:
- o Performing trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous peri ods;
- o Testing management's monitoring process over distributors' stocking levels;
- o Verifying sample sales transactions near period-end.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

## Other Information

The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises, Statutory reports, corporate governance and Board's report included in the Annual report, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report and Corporate Overview and letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. The Other information does not include the Standalone Ind AS financial statements, Consolidated Ind AS financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ind AS financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated fi nancial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group and joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its joint ventures are also responsible for overseeing the fi nancial reporting process of the Group and of its joint ventures.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements .

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal fi nancial controls with reference to fi nancial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain suffi cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the fi nancial statements of such entities included in the consolidated fi nancial statements of which we are the independent auditors. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. For the other entities included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signifi cant audit fi ndings, including any signifi cant defi ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2020 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefi ts of such communication.

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited as of and for the year ended 31 March 2020, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company") and its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating eff ectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

## Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, both, issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting with Reference to these Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated Ind AS financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## ANNEXURE 1 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED IND AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED (CONTINUED)

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements and such internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements were operating effectively as at 31 March 2020, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

## 1.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## a) Statement of compliance

These consolidated fi nancial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2020 comply in all material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 and as amended from time to time.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective or elected for early adoption at the Company's annual reporting date, 31 March 2020. These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on 20 May 2020.

## b) Basis of measurement

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

- derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;
- fi nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost, depending on the classification;
- employee defined benefit assets/(liabilities) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for actuarial gains/(losses) and the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation;
- long-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method;
- assets held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell;
- share-based payments are measured at fair value;
- investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method; and
- right-of-use the assets are recognised at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at that date. This amount is adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs, incurred, if any.

## c) Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All fi nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest millions.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these entities are largely restricted to importing of finished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash fl ows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The costs incurred by these entities are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The financing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been generally determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions, unless use of a different currency is considered appropriate.

## d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes:

- Note 1.2(c) - Assessment of functional currency;
- Note 1.3(b) - Evaluation of joint arrangements;
- Note 1.3(d) - Financial instruments;
- Note 1.3(e) - Business combinations;
- Notes 1.3(f) and 1.3(g) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- Motes 1.3(h) - determination of cost for right-of-use assets and lease term;
- Note 1.3(i) - Valuation of inventories;
- Note 1.3(j) - Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;
- Note 1.3(k) - Assets and obligations relating to employee benefits;
- Note 1.3(k) - Share-based payments;
- Note 1.3(l) - Provisions and other accruals;
- Note 1.3(m) - Measurement of transaction price in a revenue transaction (Sales returns, rebates and chargeback provisions);
- Note 1.3(p) - Evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and estimation of income tax payable and income tax expense in relation to an uncertain tax position; and
- Note 1.3(l) - Contingencies

## e) Current and non-current classifi cation

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classifi ed as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always disclosed as non-current.

## f) Prior period

Prior period amounts have been reclassifi ed to conform to the current year classification

## 1.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## a) New Standards adopted by the Company

Ind AS 116, " Leases "

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) notified Ind AS 116, " Leases " as part of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces the existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and finance leases. Lessor accounting, however , remains largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and fi nance leases is retained.

Impact of the implementation of Ind AS 116 on the Company:

The Company adopted Ind AS 116 effective as of 01 April 2019. Ind AS 116, " Leases " changed the financial statements of the Company as the majority of leases for which the Company is the lessee became on-balance sheet liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets also recognised on the consolidated balance sheet. The lease liability reflects the net present value of the remaining lease payments adjusted for payments made before the commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement, and the right-of-use asset corresponds to the lease liability.

Upon adoption of the new standard, a portion of the annual operating lease costs, which was previously fully recognised as a rental / lease expense, is recorded as interest expense. In addition, the portion of the lease payments which represents the reduction of the lease liability is recognised in the statement of cash flows as an outfl ow from financing activities, which was previously fully recognised as an outfl ow from operating activities.

The Company implemented the new standard on 1 April 2019, and applied the modified retrospective method, with right-of-use assets measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to those leases recognised in the consolidated balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application and will not restate prior years.

The Company elected to use the transition practical expedient that allows the standard to be applied only to contracts previously identified under Ind AS 17, " Leases " and the contracts assessed using the guidance available under Appendix - C to Ind AS 17, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease".

The Company also elected to use the recognition exemption for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option ("short-term leases") and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value ("low value assets").

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

On 1 April 2019, the Company recognised lease liabilities of ' 1,335 (presented as part of borrowings) and right-of-use assets of ' 1,153, after adjustments of ' 182 towards lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement as at 31 March 2019 (presented as part of Property, plant and equipment).

Consequently, the Company has recognised an amount of ' 491 in depreciation expense and ' 230 in finance costs for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Adoption of the new standard had no impact upon leases for which the Company is a lessor.

Appendix C to Ind AS 12, "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments"

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) made certain amendments to Ind AS 12, Income taxes by including Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. This appendix clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of Ind AS 12 are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. It does not apply to taxes or levies outside the scope of Ind AS 12, nor does it specifically include requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax treatments.

Appendix C explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the applicable tax authority. For example, a decision to claim a deduction for a specific expense or not to include a specific item of income in a tax return is an uncertain tax treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under applicable tax law. The interpretation provides specific guidance in several areas where previously Ind AS 12 was silent. Appendix C applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable profi t or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.

The Company applied the interpretation effective 1 April 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of Appendix C did not have any material impact on the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## b) Basis of consolidation

## Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company.

Joint arrangements (equity accounted investees)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Company has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic fi nancial and operating decisions.

A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

With respect to joint operations, the Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest ("NCI") holders have certain significant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in signifi cant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. Furthermore, the financial statements of the joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as of the Company.

## Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Company's interest in the investee.

## Changes in ownership interests

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the difference arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## Loss of Control

Upon loss of control, the Company derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any NCIs and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. If the Company retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, depending on the level of influence retained, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an investment measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI") or fair value through profit or loss ("FVTPL") under Ind AS 109, "Financial Instruments" .

## c) Foreign currency

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- certain debt instruments classifi ed as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;
- certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value;
- a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is effective; and
- qualifying cash fl ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are eff ective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash flows had occurred at the measurement date.

## Foreign operations

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as a part of foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR").

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is diff erent from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the reporting currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the reporting currency at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## d) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

## Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant fi nancing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any signifi cant fi nancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind A S 115.

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

- Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
- Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
- Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

Debt instruments at amortised cost

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of profit and loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income ("OCI"). However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies, are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheet) when:

- the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
- Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Financial liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's fi nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative fi n ancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profi t or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as fair value through profi t and loss.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in consolidated statement of profi t and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an exist ing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially diff erent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative financial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative fi nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classified as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as fi nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classifi ed to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to such relationships. Re-measurement gain or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

## e) Business combinations

In accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 101, First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards , the Company has elected to apply accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations that occurred on or after 1 April 2009. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination, such as finder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

## f) Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Selling and other expense, net" in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                                | Years    |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                  |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 to 50 |
| - Ancillary structures                     | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and machinery                        | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to 10  |
| Vehicles                                   | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortisation expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset.Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                  | Years   |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles  | 3 to 15 |
| Customer related intangibles | 1 to 11 |
| Other intangibles            | 3 to 15 |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## h) Leases

As explained inthe introduction to this note 1.3(a) above, (see New Standards adopted by the Company- Ind AS 116, "Leases"), the Company has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Company is the lessee. The new policy is described below. Refer to such introduction to this Note1.3(a) for the impact of the change in accounting policy.

Accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or after 1 April 2019

The Company's accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or after 1 April 2019 are as follows:

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognised right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

- fi xed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;
- variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencementdate;
- amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees;
- the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and
- payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the group exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the group, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The Company's lease liabilities are included in borrowings.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to consolidated statement of profi t and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of the following:

- the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- any initial direct costs, and
- restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of offi ce furniture.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Company.

Accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or prior to 31 March 2019

The Company's accounting policies relating to leases for periods ending on or prior to 31 March 2019 are as follows :

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A finance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the fi nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding lease liability.

The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

## i) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and finished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## j) Impairment

## Non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## k) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defined contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defined benefit plans

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defined benefit obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defined benefit obligation and plan assets are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defi ned benefit plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## Termination benefits

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an off er encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the off er will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefits

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefi ts is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.

The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## l) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the eff ect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the consolidated balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated fi nancial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefi ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## m) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates. Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

| Particulars                                                            | Point of recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales of generic products in India                                     | Upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company.  Control over the generic products is transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered  to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. |
| Sales of active pharmaceutical  ingredients and intermediates in India | Upon delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories  of the Company.                                                                                                                               |
| Export sales and other sales outside  of India                         | Upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract  provide for specifi c revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is  recognised once all such activities are completed.   |

## Profit share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profi t share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signifi cant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition or otherwise. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability, the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## n) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling and other expenses

## o) Other income and finance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as financing activities in the statement of cash fl ows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash fl ow hedges.

## p) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary diff erences:

- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit;
- temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are off set if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that the future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Current and deferred tax is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefi t and refl ects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## q) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## r) Government grants

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## s) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Co-Chairman and Managing Director of the Company is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and accordingly is identified as the chief operating decision maker.

## t) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## u) Rounding of amounts

All amounts in Indian Rupees disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefi ts anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefits.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and inter est cash fl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

Goodwill

Goodwill arising upon business combinations is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired. Gross carrying value and accumulated amortisation with respect to goodwill represent Indian GAAP balances, that have been carried forward as such, relating to business combination entered before the transition date i.e., 1 April 2015.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill (other than those arising upon investment in a joint venture) was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2020   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| PSAI-Active Pharmaceutical Operations    | 157                   |
| Global Generics-Complex Injectables      | 1,861                 |
| Global Generics-North America Operations | 313                   |
| Global Generics-Germany Operations       | 2,207                 |
| Global Generics-Branded Formulations     | 375                   |
|                                          | 4,913                 |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value in use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash fl ows for five years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash fl ows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used range from 6.34% to 14.00% for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rates range from 8.80% to 18.12%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

## Impairment of gNuvaring

During the year ended 31 March 2020, there were significant changes to the generics market for Ethinyl estradiol / Ethenogestral vaginal ring (a generic equivalent to Nuvaring®), one of the 8 ANDAs acquired from Teva in June 2016. The changes include the launches by competitors of both generic and authorised generic versions of the product in December 2019. Due to these adverse market developments, as at 31 December 2019, the Company tested the carrying value of this product at the product cash generating unit ("CGU") level, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash infl ows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount was determined by reference to the product's value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell, whichever is higher. This resulted in the value-in-use being the recoverable value of the product. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of ' 11,137 for the year ended 31 March 2020. This impairment loss pertained to the Company's Global Generics segment.

The carrying value of the asset after the impairment was ' 3,269.

The Company used the discounted cash flow approach to calculate the value in use, with the assistance of independent appraisers. The key assumptions considered in the calculation are as follows:

- a) Weighted average of probability adjusted revenue projections which take into consideration different scenarios such as the base case, the upside case and the downside case;
- b) Rate of generic penetration and estimated price erosion throughout the period;
- c) Estimate of useful life over which the product is expected to generate cash fl ows; and
- d) the net cash fl ows have been discounted based on a post-tax discounting tax rate of 8%.

In June 2019, the Company launched tobramycin inhalation solution, USP, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of TOBI® (tobramycin) Inhalation Solution, and in July 2019 the Company launched ramelteon tablets, 8 mg, a therapeutically equivalent generic version of Rozerem® (ramelteon, 8 mg) Tablets. Subsequent to their respective launches, both products experienced adverse market conditions, such as increased competition and reduced selling prices by competitors. As a result, the performance of the products was significantly lower than the Company's prior estimates. Furthermore, the Company decided to drop the launch of its planned imiquimod cream product. Accordingly, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of intangible assets associated with these three products, and recognised an impairment loss of ' 4,385 (US$ 61.4 millions) for the year ended 31 March 2020. These impairment losses pertained to the Company's Global Generics segment.

In view of the specific triggers occurring in the year with respect to some of other product related intangible assets forming part of the Company's Global Generics and Proprietary Products segments, the Company determined that there was a decrease in the market potential of these products primarily due to higher than expected price erosion and increased competition leading to lower volumes. Consequently, the Company recorded an amount of ' 1,235 as impairment loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Impairment losses recorded for the year ended 31 March 2019

As a result of the Company's decision to discontinue a few products pertaining to its Global Generics segment, product related intangibles of ' 116 were recorded as impairment loss for the year ended 31 March 2019 in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Consequent to the materiality of the amount involved, these impairment amounts have been disclosed separately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Interest capitalisation

During the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, the Company capitalised interest cost of ' 674 and ' 655, respectively, with respect to certain qualifying assets. The rate for capitalisation of interest cost for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 ranged from 2.04% to 4.60% and from 1.98% to 4.12%, respectively.

During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Company entered into an arrangement with a bank for the sale of its trade receivables. Under the arrangement, the Company sells to the bank certain of its trade receivables forming part of its Global Generics segment, on a non-recourse basis. The receivables sold were mutually agreed upon with the bank after considering the credit worthiness and contractual terms with the customer including any gross to net adjustments due to rebates, discounts etc. from the contracted amounts. As a result, the receivables sold are generally lower than the total net amount of trade receivables. The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such receivables sold to the bank and accordingly, the same are derecognised in the consolidated balance sheet. As on 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, the amount of trade receivables de-recognised pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement was ' 9,049 (US$ 120 millions) and ' 7,592 (US$ 110 millions), respectively.

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on its trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers. The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 are as follows:

- * Currently, the Company does not separately track provisions and adjustments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks. However, the adjustments are expected to be non-material. The volumes used to calculate the closing balance of chargebacks represent approximately 1.3 months equivalent of sales, which corresponds to the pending chargeback claims yet to be processed.
- ** Currently, the Company does not separately track the credits and payments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks, rebates, medicaid payments or refund liability.
- (1) Chargebacks and rebates provisions for the year ended 31 March 2019 and payments for the year ended 31 March 2019 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2018, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for chargebacks, and due to a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products.
- $^{(2) }$ Chargebacks provisions for the year ended 31 March 2020 were higher compared to the year ended 31 March 2019, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes, which were partially offset due to a lower pricing rates per unit for chargebacks. Such lower pricing was primarily on account of a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products. The chargebacks payments for the year ended 31 March 2020 were lower compared to the year ended 31 March 2019, primarily as a result of higher pending chargebacks claims at 31 March 2020 as compared to 31 March 2019. The rebates provisions and the payments for the year ended 31 March 2020 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2019, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for rebates due to a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products which were partially offset by higher sales volumes during the year ended 31 March 2020 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2019.

The estimates of "gross-to-net" adjustments for the Company's operations in India and other countries outside of the United States relate mainly to refund liability in all such operations, and certain rebates to healthcare insurance providers are specific to the Company's German operations. The pattern of such refund liability is generally consistent with the Company's gross sales. In Germany, the rebates to healthcare insurance providers mentioned above are contractually fi xed in nature and do not involve signifi cant estimations by the Company.

The Company's overall refund liability as at 31 March 2020 relating to its North America Generics business was US$ 24 millions, as compared to a liability of US$ 30 millions as at 31 March 2019. This decrease in the Company's liability was primarily attributable to a lower refund liability allowance for the year ended 31 March 2020 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2019. Such allowance change was primarily due to certain product mix changes and recent trends in actual sales returns, together with the Company's historical experience and also the price reduction for certain products resulting into lower refund liability to be carried.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Gratuity benefi ts provided by the parent company

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a defined benefi t plan which provides for gratuity payments (the "Gratuity Plan") and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund") to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by the Government of India and in debt securities and equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 consist of the following:

Employee stock incentive plans

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan, 2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan")

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan")

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and five years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2018 Plan provides for option grants having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant as follows:

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity.

Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2020 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2019 was primarily on account of:

- recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credits in Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, India on account of a reduction in the MAT rate from 21.55% to 17.47% pursuant to the recently enacted Taxation laws (Amendment) Act 2019 for the fiscal year ended 31 March 2020 and subsequent periods;
- recognition of deferred tax asset related to losses for impairment of certain product related intangibles of the Company;
- recognition of deferred tax asset pursuant to planned restructuring activity between the group companies; and
- non taxability of income from sale of capital assets as it is set off against the carried forward capital loss.

## d) Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities

The details of unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarised below:

| Particulars                           | As at  31 March 2020   | As at  31 March 2019   |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Deductible temporary differences, net | 387                    | 5,479                  |

During the year ended 31 March 2020, the Company recognised deferred tax assets of ' 5,092 on certain deductible temporary diff erences, as the Company believes that it is probable that there will be available taxable profits against which such temporary differences can be utilised.

During the year ended 31 March 2020, the Company did not recognise deferred tax assets of ' 359 on operating tax losses.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of ' 23,615 as at 31 March 2020, of subsidiaries, where it is expected that earnings of the subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. Generally, the Company indefinitely reinvests all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, and accordingly, has not recorded any deferred taxes in relation to such undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries.

The tax effects of significant temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of the items that created these differences is given below:

| Investments                                        | 65                     | 197                    |

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary diff erences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefits of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Operating loss carry forward consists of business losses, unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed interest carry-forwards. A portion of this total loss can be carried indefi nitely and the remaining amounts expire at various dates ranging from 2021 through 2027.

Financial instruments (continued)

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

A net gain/loss of ' Nil, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the foreign exchange gains and losses and finance costs. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of consolidated statement of profit and loss, a net gain of ' 33 and a net loss of ' 0 for the year ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019 respectively.

The Company had outstanding interest swap arrangements that hedged a portion of interest rate risk arising from fl oating rate, dollar denominated foreign currency borrowing of ' Nil and US$ 50 millions as at 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, respectively.

## 2.32 Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in United States dollars, Russian roubles, U.K pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars, Russian roubles, South African rands, Mexican pesos and Brazilian reals). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fl uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.31 to these consolidated financial statements.

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- a ' 1,203/(1,740) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 2,070/(1,745) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at 31 March 2020;
- a ' 1,872/(1,349) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 1,789/(1,873) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at 31 March 2019.

For the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by ' 1,710 and ' 857, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2020, the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows: ' 10,971 of loans carrying a floating interest rate ranging from 1 Month LIBOR plus 12.5 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps; ' 4,000 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month India Treasury Bill plus 60 bps; ' 1,627 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Month LIBOR plus 55 bps; ' 1,579 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of TIIE+1.25%, and ' 63 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of 1 Month JIBAR plus 120 bps.

As of 31 March 2019, the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows: ' 31,154 of loans carrying a floating interest rate ranging from 1 Month LIBOR plus 25 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 105 bps; ' 72 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month JIBAR plus 120 bps; and ' 1,749 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of TIIE+1.25%. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profiles, refer note 2.10 A and B of these consolidated fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2020 and 31 March 2019, every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR, Treasury Bill, JIBAR and TIIE) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 41 and ' 93, respectively.

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings, interest component of which was designated in a cash flow hedge, was ' Nil and ' 3,458 as of 31 March 2020 and as on 31 March 2019, respectively.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

2.32

Financial risk management (continued)

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2020, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

## b) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

## Details of financial assets - not due, past due and impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2020. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days.

The ageing of trade receivables is given below:

| Particulars                         | As at  31 March 2020   | As at  31 March 2019   |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Neither past due nor impaired       | 45,864                 | 33,874                 |
| Past due but not impaired           |                        |                        |
| Less than 365 days                  | 6,305                  | 6,262                  |

| Less :  Allowance for credit losses | (1,202)                | (1,172)                |
| Total                               | 52,015                 | 39,982                 |

See Note 2.6 B of these consolidated fi nancial statements for the activity in the allowance for credit losses.

Other than trade receivables, the Company has no signifi cant class of fi nancial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more significant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

## Launch of product

On 14 June 2018, the U.S. FDA granted the Company final approval for buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg dosages, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Suboxone® sublingual film. The U.S. FDA approval came after the conclusion of litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware District Court"), where the Delaware District Court held that patents covering Suboxone® sublingual fi lm would not be infringed by the Company's commercial launch of its generic sublingual fi lm product. In light of the favourable decision from the Delaware District Court, the Company launched its generic sublingual fi lm product in the U.S. immediately following the U.S. FDA approval on 14 June 2018. On 12 July 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("the Court of Appeals") affi rmed the Delaware District Court's ruling that the Company's generic version of Suboxone® sublingual films did not infringe the two remaining patents at issue in the Delaware Disrtict Court's case (U.S. patent numbers 8,603,514 and 8,015,150).

## Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

After the Delaware District Court's decision, Indivior filed a second lawsuit against the Company alleging infringement of three additional U.S. patents (numbers 9,687,454, 9,855,221 and 9,931,305) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the "New Jersey District Court"), styled Indivior Inc. et al. v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories S.A., Civil Action No. 2:17-cv-07111 (D.N.J.). Following the launch, on 15 June 2018, Indivior filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Company in the New Jersey District Court. Indivior's motion alleged that the Company's generic sublingual film product infringed one of three U.S. patents (number 9,931,305) at issue in the New Jersey District Court. Pending a hearing and decision on the injunction application, the New Jersey District Court initially issued a temporary restraining order against the Company with respect to further sales, offer for sales, and imports of its generic sublingual film product in the United States. Subsequently, on 14 July 2018, the New Jersey District Court granted a preliminary injunction in favour of Indivior. Under the order, Indivior was required to and did post a bond of $72 to pay the costs and damages sustained by the Company if it was found to be wrongfully enjoined. The Company immediately appealed the decision, and the Court of Appeals agreed to expedite the appeal.

On 20 November 2018, the Court of Appeals issued a decision vacating the preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals denied Indivior's petition for rehearing on 4 February 2019.

Indivior subsequently filed two emergency motions in the Court of Appeals to stay issuance of the mandate and to keep the preliminary injunction in place, which the Court of Appeals denied. Indivior then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to stay issuance of the mandate.

Indivior's petition was denied by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on 19 February 2019, and the mandate was issued on the same day. The Company resumed sales of its generic sublingual film product after the mandate was issued.

On 19 February 2019, the New Jersey District Court entered a stipulated order of dismissal of Indivior's claims under U.S. patent number 9,855,221. On 5 November 2019, the New Jersey District Court issued its claim construction decision construing certain terms in U.S. patent numbers 9,931,305 and 9,687,454. After such claim construction decision, on 8 January 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered a stipulated order that the Company's generic sublingual film product does not infringe the asserted claims in U.S. patent number 9,931,305. In the stipulated order, Indivior reserved the ability to appeal the New Jersey District Court's claim construction order. The Company has fi led a motion requesting the New Jersey District Court enter partial final judgement in the Company's favour relating to the allegations of infringement of U.S. patent number 9,931,305.

On 11 November 2019, a Magistrate Judge in the District of New Jersey granted the Company leave to fi le a counterclaim against Indivior that alleges that Indivior engaged in anticompetitive conduct by making false or misleading statements to the New Jersey District Court during the preliminary injunction proceedings in violation of federal antitrust laws. Indivior has appealed the Magistrate Judge's decision to the New Jersey District Court. Indivior has also fi led a motion requesting that the New Jersey District Court bifurcate and stay the antitrust case until after the completion of Indivior's infringement case regarding the only remaining asserted patent (U.S. patent number 9,687,454).

The parties continue to litigate Indivior's allegation that the Company's generic sublingual film products infringe any valid claim of U.S. patent number 9,687,454, with such litigation ongoing before the New Jersey District Court and the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB"). In the PTAB, on 13 November 2018, the Company filed two petitions for inter-partes review challenging the validity of certain claims of U.S. patent number 9,687,454 before the PTAB. On 13 June 2019, the PTAB agreed to institute inter-partes review on one of the two pe titions fi led by the Company .

The PTAB heard oral argument in the pending inter- partes review challenge on 3 March 2020. A final decision is expected from the PTAB by June 2020.

The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions and pursue a claim for damages caused by the preliminary injunction. Any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

## Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specifi ed product" and fi x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfloxacin as a "specifi ed product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fixing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

2.33

Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fixed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA fi led a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfl oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fi xing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 11 June 2020 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notifi ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA fi led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application fi led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had filed, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company filed a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to file a final counter affi davit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could file a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter affi davit was fi led by the Union of India. The Company subsequently filed a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 16 June 2020 for hearing.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

2.33

Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 268 under "Selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Other product and patent related matters

Child resistant packaging matter complaint under the False Claims Act ("FCA")

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged in a letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the "CPSA") and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the "PPPA") and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Specifically, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certificates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC's allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") began to investigate a sealed complaint which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") related to these same issues (the "FCA Complaint"). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the Company, proceeded without the DOJ's and applicable States' involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company's generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company fi led its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and allowing the plaintiffs one more chance to refi le this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations.

On 29 March 2017, the plaintiffs fi led their fi nal amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

The parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ's offi ce in Washington, D.C. in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ relates to five of the blister pack products.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for a civil penalty of US$5 millions ( ' 319), and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the Company has not admitted any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

During the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff s subsequently filed a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

In June 2018, the plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. During the three months ended September 2018, the plaintiffs and the DOJ settled and thus this appeal was dismissed. The plaintiffs then filed an application for recovery of attorneys' fees from the Company under the "alternative remedy doctrine." The Company made opposing filings to this and in response the plaintiff s withdrew their application.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the FCA Complaint is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Namenda Litigation

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health & Welfare Fund ("Sergeants") filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the Alzheimer's drug Namenda® (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009 until 2010. Sergeants seeks to represent a class of "end payor" purchasers of Namenda® tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding Namenda® tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator's attempt to shift sales from the original immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product. The Company believes that the complaint lacks merit and that the Company's conduct complied with all applicable laws and regulations.

Defendants' motions to dismiss were denied. Discovery is ongoing.

On 5 November 2019 plaintiffs MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC filed suit against the Company and other drug manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The claims in this complaint were similar in nature to the claims in the Sergeants lawsuit, and those cases were coordinated for discovery purposes. On 14 April 2020, with the consent of the Company and the other defendants, plaintiffs MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice.

Other class action complaints containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint have also been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. However, apart from the Sergeants case described above, there are no such class actions that are pending and that name the Company as a defendant.

In addition, the State of New York filed an antitrust case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set forth in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of alleged violation of federal antitrust laws is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Ranitidine Recall and Litigation

On 1 October 2019, the Company initiated a voluntary nationwide retail (at the retail level for over-the-counter products and at the consumer level for prescription products) of all of its ranitidine medications sold in the United States due to the presence of N-Nitrosodimethylamine ("NDMA") above levels established by the U.S. FDA. NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen (a substance that could cause cancer) based on results from laboratory tests. On 1 November 2019, the U.S. FDA issued a statement indicating that it had found levels of NDMA in ranitidine from its testing generally that were "similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats." See https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-new-testing-results-including-low-levels-impurities-ranitidine-drugs. The U.S. FDA has indicated that its investigation and testing continue. On 1 April 2020, the U.S. FDA issued a press release announcing that it was requesting manufacturers to withdraw all prescription and over-the-counter ranitidine drugs from the market immediately. The U.S. FDA stated that it "has determined that the impurity in some ranitidine products increases over time and when stored at higher than room temperatures may result in consumer exposure to unacceptable levels of this impurity." See https://www.fda.gov/safety/medical-product-safety-information/all-ranitidine-products-zantac-press-release-fda-requests-removal?utm\_ campaign=FDA%20MedWatch.

One of the Company's US subsidiaries and one Swiss subsidiary were initially named as a defendant in one class action complaint in the Northern District of Illinois related to ranitidine (the "White Putative Class Action"), which was later transferred to the Southern District of Florida as a related action in the ranitidine multidistrict litigation ("MDL"). Plaintiffs in the White Putative Class Action do not allege that they have suffered any injury arising from the ingestion of the Company's ranitidine, but sought certifi cation of a nationwide class of all individuals who used prescription or over-the-counter ranitidine manufactured by the Company and who have not been diagnosed with cancer. The White Putative Class Action was dismissed without prejudice as to the Company's US subsidiary and Swiss subsidiary on 2 March 2020.

Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

One of the Company's US subsidiaries has been named as a defendant, along with several other pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers, in seventeen individual injury lawsuits, which are part of the ranitidine MDL. All seventeen cases involve personal injury allegations relating to the Plaintiff's use of ranitidine. The lawsuits involve claims for design defect, failure to warn, negligence, breach of express warranties, and breach of implied warranties. The plaintiff s in the various personal injury lawsuits seek to recover unspecified compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest, and attorneys' fees as allowed by law. One of the Company's US subsidiaries was also named as a defendant, along with several other pharmaceutical manufacturers and retailers, in a class action complaint, which is also part of the ranitidine MDL. The class action complaint does not allege that plaintiffs suffered personal injuries by taking ranitidine, but rather that they suffered economic losses stemming from the purchase of ranitidine, which was purportedly worth less than they paid due to the levels of NDMA contained therein.

Multiple other putative class actions and individual injury lawsuits against other ranitidine manufacturers and sellers have been filed and comprise the MDL. While various interested party filings have predicted thousands of ranitidine-related lawsuits will be filed, it is not possible at this time to accurately predict the scope of the litigation as a whole or the extent of the Company's role or involvement in ranitidine-related litigation.

The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these claims. The Company believes that all of the aforesaid complaints and asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also, any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements of the Company.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were filed against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifically, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plaintiffs in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plaintiffs' right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were filed against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multi product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company fi led a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plaintiffs fi led opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was fi led by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

On 12 December 2019, an Order of the Court of Common Pleas placed the matter "in Deferred Status Pending Further Developments in Related Federal Multidistrict Litigation."

- q) Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas Praecipe For a Writ of Summons Filed by 7 End Payor Entities consisting of Blue Cross Blue Shield entities and other health insurance companies:

On 6 May 2020, a Praecipe For a Writ of Summons for a tort action was filed in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, First Judicial District of Pennsylvania, Civil Trial Division, by 7 Blue Cross Blue Shield entities and other health insurance companies, against the Company's U.S. subsidiary and 69 other defendants (consisting of 51 other pharmaceutical companies and 17 individuals). These 7 plaintiffs had been previously encompassed by the End Payor Plaintiff class actions in the MDL. Only a Praecipe of Writ of Summons has been filed. No complaint has been filed and, therefore, the potential claims have not been asserted or delineated in any manner, including what drugs any such claims may relate to. A complaint may, at some point, be filed encompassing the claims asserted by the End Payor Plaintiff class actions in the MDL actions. It is anticipated that this action will be placed in Deferred Status Pending Further Developments in the related MDL case. Because no Complaint has been filed setting forth any claims, and because it is expected that the action will be placed into Deferred Status, no response is required by the Company's subsidiary at this time.

The Company believes that the aforesaid asserted claims in subsections a) though q) above are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also, any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafi l finished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and fi nished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the fi ling of a NDA for the product by Mezzion.

In this regard, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of said denial, was also denied.

The Commercial Court, Hyderabad has accepted the request of the Company to withdraw the suit, in view of the Court granting the Company's motion to file a counterclaim in the action.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company .

## (iii) Securities Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, its Chief Executive Offi cer and its Chief Financial Offi cer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 15 May 2020, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., and certain of the Company's current or former directors and offi cers, have entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the "Stipulation") with lead plaintiff the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi in the putative securities class action filed against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. As consideration for the settlement of the class action, the Company has agreed to pay US$ 9 millions. The settlement is subject to the approval of the court and may be terminated prior to court approval pursuant to the grounds for termination set forth in the Stipulation. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the settlement consideration, lead plaintiff and members of the settlement class who do not opt-out of this settlement would release, among other things, the claims that were asserted, or that they could have asserted, in this class action. In entering into the settlement, the defendants do not admit, and explicitly deny, any liability or wrongdoing of any kind.

Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, the settlement resolves the remainder of the litigation.

As the Company is adequately insured with respect to the aforesaid liability, the settlement did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statement of profi t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

The amount payable to the plaintiff s on account of the settlement and the corresponding receivable from the insurer have been presented under "other current financial assets" and "other current financial liabilities", respectively in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at 31 March 2020.

## (iv) Glenmark Litigation

In November 2017, the Company received a letter from Glenmark Farmaceutica Ltda and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (collectively "Glenmark") for invocation of arbitration under a distribution agreement and a deed of assignment relating to a product between the Company and Glenmark. Glenmark alleged that the non-supply of the product by the Company severely affected the value of the intellectual property and goodwill and asserted claims to recover the loss along with interest and penalties from the Company.

In March 2018, an arbitrator was appointed by the Supreme Court of India at Glenmark's request. In July 2018, Glenmark filed a claim statement against the Company and in September 2018, the Company fi led a reply against the claim along with a counterclaim.

Glenmark filed a reply to the counter claim of the Company in November 2018 and the issues were fi nalised. Inspection of documents along with the filing of the statement of admissions and denials was completed in December 2018.The Company was asked to submit the list of witnesses by 5 March 2019.

Affi davits in chief examination were filed by witnesses of the Company and Glenmark. The cross examination of the witnesses of Glenmark was completed and that of the Company commenced and continued in November and December 2019. The parties have agreed to settle the disputes for an amount of ' 50 payable by the Company to Glenmark.

Accordingly, during the three months ended 31 December 2019, the Company recognised the provision of ' 50 representing the probable outfl ow on account of settlement of litigation. The such provision is recognised as part of "Selling and other expenses".

The Settlement Deed entered into between the parties was confirmed as an arbitral award dated 11 February 2020 by the arbitrator and the issue remains closed.

## (vi) Environmental matters Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollaram and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fixed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently fi led a review petition against the judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company filed an appeal challenging this judgement.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgement in July 2018 and directed the respondents to fi le their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents fi led counter affi davits and the matter has now been adjourned for fi nal hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgement of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued G.O.Ms. No 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded financial year i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019.

During the three months ended September 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") has issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated 24 October 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from financial year 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of the said effected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram. The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application filed by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from financial year 2016-2017 to 2018- 2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5 % as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated 3 August 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G O Ms No 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G O Ms No 31 dated 24 May 2019 and basis the judgement of NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017 for the years 2015-2016 to 2018 -2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2 and CTO-3 of the Company.

On 22 November 2019, The Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued an Interim Order which stayed the demand on the condition that the Company deposit ' 60 as the remediation fee for the previous year 2018-2019 payable in the year 2019-2020. The deposit of ' 60 was made and the Interim Order is continuing. The matter was adjourned to 22 April 2020 but has been delayed as a result of the closure of the Court due to the COVID-19 lockdown and a new date has not yet been rescheduled.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the fi nancial statements.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners that was pending in the National Green Tribunal, (the "NGT"), Delhi.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the NGT. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to the point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notification that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

The appeals filed by Mr. K. Chidambaram against the Orders of the Appellate Authority, Andhra Pradesh are disposed off as the same do not survive for consideration as the G.O. based on which the then APPCB had passed its order which was subject matter of appeal before the Appellate Authority has itself been amended vide order 25 July 2013. However, the NGT, Delhi has passed a direction for the issue of pollution to be considered by the Joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Institute ("NEERI"), and the Telangana State Pollution Control Board to ascertain the present status of pollution issues in the Medak, Ranga Reddy, Mahaboobnagar and Nalagonda districts in the State of Telangana particularly in the Patancheru and Bollaram industrial clusters and file a report within three months before the NGT, Delhi.

## (vii) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additi onal fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (viii) Direct taxes related matters

The Company is contesting various disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact for disallowances being more likely than not to be accepted by Tax authorities is ' 2,291, and accordingly, no provision is made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2020.

During the years ended 31 March 2014, 2015 and 2016, Industrias Quimicas Falcon de Mexico, S.A. de CV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico, received a notice from Mexico's Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria ("SAT"), with respect to disallowance on account of transfer pricing adjustments pertaining to the calendar years ended 31 December 2006, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The associated tax impact is ' 686 (MXN 213 millions) and profit share impact is ' 81 (MXN 25 millions). The Company filed administrative appeals with the SAT by challenging these disallowances and, during February and March 2017, the Company received orders of the SAT confirming these disallowances by dismissing its administrative appeals. The Company disagrees with the SAT's disallowances and filed an appeal with the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa (Federal Tax and Administrative Court of Mexico) in March and April 2017.

The Company believes that it is more likely than not that it would prevail over the SAT in this litigation. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2020.

## (ix) Indirect taxes related matters

Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in these consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2020.

The Company is in the process of responding to the notices. The Company believes that it has correctly distributed and availed the input tax credit within the provisions of the applicable act.

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 26 as on 31 March 2020 and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to credits is not probable.

Collaboration agreement with Curis, Inc.

On 18 January 2015, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited ("Aurigene"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent company, entered into a Collaboration, License and Option Agreement (the "Collaboration Agreement") with Curis, Inc. ("Curis") to discover, develop and commercialise small molecule antagonists for immuno-oncology and precision oncology targets.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene has the responsibility for conducting all discovery and preclinical activities, including Investigational New Drug ("IND") enabling studies and providing Phase 1 clinical trial supply, and Curis is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory and commercialisation efforts worldwide, excluding India and Russia. The Collaboration Agreement provides that the parties will collaborate exclusively in immuno-oncology for an initial period of approximately two years, with the option for Curis to extend the broad immuno-oncology exclusivity.

As partial consideration for the collaboration, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 18 January 2015, Curis issued to Aurigene 17.1 millions shares of its common stock, representing 19.9% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to the transaction (approximately 16.6% of its outstanding common stock immediately after the transaction). Such shares were initially subject to a lock-up agreement. However, as of 31 March 2017, lock-up restrictions were released on all of the aforementioned 17.1 millions shares. In connection with the issuance of such shares, Curis and Aurigene entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated 18 January 2015 which provides for certain registration rights with respect to resale of the shares. The common stock of Curis is listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Global Market.

The fair value of the shares of Curis common stock on the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement was ' 1,452 (US$ 23.5 millions).

Revenues under the Collaboration Agreement consist of upfront consideration (including the shares of Curis common stock) and the development and commercial milestone payments described below, which are deferred and recognised as revenue over the period for which Aurigene has continuing performance obligations.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene is entitled to development and commercial milestone payments as follows:

- for the first two programs: up to US$ 52.5 millions per program, including US$ 42.5 millions for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any;
- for the third and fourth programs: up to US$ 50 millions per program, including US$ 42.5 millions for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any; and
- for any program thereafter: up to US$ 140.5 millions per program, including US$ 87.5 millions for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any.

In addition, Curis has agreed to pay Aurigene royalties, ranging between high single digits to 10%, on its net sales in territories where it commercialises products. Furthermore, Aurigene is entitled to receive a share of Curis' revenues from sublicenses, which share varies based upon specified factors such as the sublicensed territory, whether the sublicense revenue is royalty based or non-royalty based and, in some cases, the stage of the applicable molecule and product at the time the sublicense is granted.

On 7 September 2016, the Collaboration Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance to Aurigene of approximately 10.2 millions additional shares of Curis common stock in lieu of receiving up to US$ 24.5 millions of milestone and other payments from Curis that could have become due under the Collaboration Agreement. These shares of Curis common stock are recorded at US$ 1.84 per share, which is equal to the market price of such shares of common stock on the date of issuance, amounting to an aggregate market value of ' 1,247 (US$ 18.8 millions).

These additional shares are also subject to a lock-up agreement, which is similar to the lock-up for the original Curis shares the Company received. However, this lock-up remains effective until 7 September 2018, with shares being released from such lock-up in 25% increments on each of 7 March 2017, 7 September 2017, 7 March 2018 and 7 September 2018, subject to acceleration of release of all the shares in connection with a change of control of Curis. As of 31 March 2020, lock-up restrictions were released on an aggregate of 10.2 millions of such additional shares of Curis common stock, representing 100% of the shares which Aurigene received from Curis in 2016.

In May 2018, Curis completed a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its common stock. After giving effect to such stock split, the total number of Curis equity shares held by the Company is 5.47 millions.

The Company has evaluated the transaction under Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures , and believes that the Company does not have any significant influence with respect to Curis. Accordingly, all of the shares of Curis common stock are classified as instruments at FVTOCI. Accordingly, loss of ' 2,407 arising from changes in the fair value of such shares of common stock was recognised in other comprehensive income as of 31 March 2020.

Products manufactured at the facility are not currently exported to the EU. The Company submitted a Corrective and Preventive Action Plan ("CAPA") to the Regulator.

The Company submitted a Corrective and Preventive Action Plan ("CAPA") to the Regulator to address the remaining issues affecting this excluded product.

In March 2019, the facility was re-inspected by the Regulator and considered to be fully compliant.

## 2.42 Impact of COVID - 19

The threats posed by the coronavirus outbreak are multifold. In many countries, businesses are being forced to cease or limit their operations for long or indefinite period of time. Even in India the outbreak has been declared an epidemic or pandemic and on 24 March 2020, the Government of India ordered a nationwide lockdown, limiting movement of population of India as a preventive measure against the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result most of the businesses are dealing with lost revenue and disrupted supply chains. The disruption to global supply chains due to factory shutdowns has already exposed the vulnerabilities of many organisations.

However, as the Company operates in the industry that is considered essential, the operations were continuing during lockdown by ensuring appropriate measures.

The Company considered the uncertainty relating to the COVID-19 pandemic in assessing the recoverability of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. For this purpose, the Company considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these financial statements. The Company has also used the principles of prudence in applying judgements, estimates and assumptions including sensitivity analysis and based on the current estimates, the Company expects to fully recover the carrying amount of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets.

As the outbreak continues to evolve, the Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.
