## Message from the Chairman

<!-- image -->

## Dear Shareholder,

Even as the world experiences economic turbulence and slowdown, contributing to a general lack of cheer as far as economic growth goes, India continues to deliver a standout performance and grow at a rapid pace. At the same time, however, ensuring access to quality healthcare remains a primary challenge for governments and communities.

At Dr. Reddy's we continue to advance on our purpose of accelerating access to affordable and innovative medicines and delivering on our brand promises. Despite the challenges in our operating environment, we have managed to stay resilient and report a credible performance. We had our fair share of challenges, which we are working hard to surmount and overcome.

Let me give you a synopsis of your Company's performance in FY2016.

- · Gross profi t margin was at 59.6%, 2 percentage points higher.
- · Consolidated revenues grew by 4% over the previous year to ' 154.7 billion.
- · EBITDA was more or less unchanged at ' 36.3 billion, and accounted for 23.4% of consolidated revenues. After adjusting for the impact of devaluation and translation of net monetary assets in Venezuela, EBITDA was 26.7% of revenues at ' 41.2 billion.
- · PAT was 10% less at ' 20 billion, 12.9% of revenues.
- · PBT was 4% less at ' 27.1 billion, 17.5% of revenues.

We need to share with you the reasons for your Company's somewhat subdued performance in FY2016, which was broadly the result of three key events:

First: The USFDA inspected three of our plants between November 2014 and March 2015. In November 2015, they sent a warning letter to your Company. We have responded to them with a comprehensive plan of corrective and remedial actions with clear timelines. However, this event and the remedial steps that followed have delayed launches of key products and certain APIs which, in turn, signifi cantly lowered incremental revenues.

Second: The economic problems in Russia and the sharp devaluation of the rouble led to a decline in our revenues from Russia by 29% to ' 10.6 billion.

Third: The continuing economic crisis in Venezuela led to a clampdown on foreign exchange outfl ows due to which your Company received no approvals from the Venezuelan government to repatriate amounts beyond US$ 4 million. The remaining Venezuelan net monetary assets were translated using the DICOM rate resulting in a write-down of ' 5.09 billion.

These three factors notwithstanding, there were several commendable developments which reinforce your Company's position as a key participant in the global pharmaceutical industry.

Revenues from North America grew by 19% to ' 75.4 billion. The sustained performance of our injectables franchise and market share gains in key molecules were the main reason.

Revenues from India also grew at 19%, reaching ' 21.3 billion. This was primarily due to the continued momentum of our mega-brands, some profi table business development deals and the good performance of pharmaceutical products acquired from UCB in April 2015.

Europe did well too. Revenues from generics expanded by 19% to ' 7.7 billion. Growth was driven largely by two complex generic products:

(i) aripiprazole, used in treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and (ii) pregabalin, used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain and anxiety disorder.

We are particularly proud of the advances made in our Proprietary Products (PP) business. We launched Zembrace TM SymTouch TM , used in treating migraines, approved by the USFDA in January 2016. In May 2016, we launched Sernivo TM , a prescription topical steroid spray, used for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, after receiving USFDA approval. Sernivo TM exemplifi es your Company's focus on differentiated drug delivery.

We have also initiated a share buyback to leverage strong cashfl ows, strengthen our balance sheet and deliver value to you, our shareholders.

What do I foresee for the next year? It is diffi cult to assess the probable situation in Venezuela and Russia in the near future. In case of Venezuela, your Company has decided to supply medicines only against letters of credit or pre-payment. We are cautiously optimistic about Russia, given that there is a gradual recovery in the crude prices, and its direct impact on the rouble. We have started strengthening our pipeline with complex generics, better OTC offerings, and increasing our institutional/ hospitals business.

We have undertaken remedial measures with an extreme sense of urgency and purpose. Therefore, I am reasonably confi dent that we will resolve the issues at the earliest and continue to focus on driving growth.

Our growth, going forward, will be driven by the attractive pipeline of complex generics as well as our new proprietary products. We will leverage these across the markets we operate in, together with increasing our OTC portfolio. We are creating a branded generics platform in North America and expanding our

## We accelerate access to affordable and innovative medicines because Good Health Can't Wait.

biologics play in Russia, CIS and other emerging markets. The outlook for the API business is also positive.

We truly believe that delivering good health requires more than just good products. In order to deliver good health, we must build a business which is robust, around processes that are best-in-class, and with a mindset that is long-term, while investing in high-quality assets and the best people. Over the years, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to do so and continuously improve from within. We are building an organisation on the foundation of operational excellence (OE), with a strong product pipeline and a sustainable business model that is value-accretive for all the stakeholders.

Operational excellence (OE) acts as a bulwark against adversities and margin challenges thereby empowering our people to become engines of our growth.

For us to fulfi l our stated purpose of accelerating access to affordable and innovative medicines, we have to continue tirelessly on the journey towards excellence in every facet.

The Board and I are truly grateful for the support that we continue to receive from all our stakeholders. Let's chart the good health path together starting from within.

Best wishes,

K Satish Reddy Chairman

## Message from the Co-Chairman & CEO

<!-- image -->

## Dear Shareholder,

India holds the potential of being a global manufacturing leader. Yet there are many barriers that are holding it back - a weak public infrastructure, poor hygiene and sanitation conditions, and a mindset that does not instinctively think world-class. While things are changing, the journey is still a long one. In this context, it is organisations such as yours that can lead the way for a renaissance in Indian manufacturing. And we are well on that journey.

'Good health starts from within'. This precept is as true for companies as it is for people. Over the years, Dr. Reddy's has had an enviable record of business growth and profi tability built on the foundation of deep scientifi c expertise, relentless execution, responsible business practices and an unwavering commitment to do the right thing.

During the year FY2016, we encountered challenging circumstances on a few fronts. Yet, unexpectedly, they served as timely reminders, and even inspiration, to renew our focus on operational excellence and shape a more impactful future for your Company. We made signifi cant investments of time and resources in strengthening the three foundational aspects of operational excellence - People, Systems & Processes, and Technology.

Our purpose of accelerating access to affordable and innovative medicines continues to inspire us each day.

Over the years, Dr. Reddy's has maintained an enviable growth record in business and profi tability, built on the foundation of deep scientifi c expertise, relentless execution, responsible business practices and an unwavering commitment to do the right thing.

## EMPOWERING PEOPLE ON THE SHOP FLOOR

This year, we extended the spread of Self-Managed Teams (SMTs) to more of our existing facilities. The SMT program is one of our leading interventions that successfully drives meaningful change and responsible empowerment on the shop fl oor. In this program, we recruit youngsters who have completed class 12, from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. We train them for several months after which they are employed in our factories. We also enrol them in a custom-designed undergraduate program in a local university. They graduate in about 5 years while they continue to work.

Equipped with the right skills, appropriate tools and an enabling environment they are able to determine, plan and manage their jobs end-toend, thereby eliminating the need for hierarchy. In our experience, SMT recruits stand apart from their industry peers and deliver high quality output. 'The SMT Way' as we call it, is a cultural shift calling for change not only in work practices, but also in the thinking process. We have witnessed that our SMT recruits become highly skilled technicians and grow in their respective fi elds, be it at Dr. Reddy's or elsewhere in the health industry.

## REWIRING OUR QUALITY SYSTEMS

We set out to rewire our quality systems from grounds-up. This involved overhauling our Standard Operating Procedures by removing redundancies, simplifying, creating better and more complete procedures, and harmonising the entire system. We made structural changes for ensuring the quality of our products throughout their life cycle, while also providing vital integration between product development, quality and manufacturing on an ongoing basis. I fi rmly believe that as a result of our efforts we will have a much stronger quality system by the end of 2016.

## USING TECHNOLOGY TO ELIMINATE HUMAN ERROR

The need for providing dignity of labour and our own enhanced safety goals have steered us to accelerate the mechanization and automation at our units, allowing us to redeploy our human resources towards valueadded and more productive work. This has also led to improved productivity, better consistency in quality and shorter turnaround times. We are also speeding up digitisation across the key product development functions through design and deployment of large-scale projects that signifi cantly reduce manual intervention and thereby minimise error.

As we continue our journey towards excellence, we are constantly fi nding ways to ensure that the way we develop, manufacture, and ship our products has minimal impact on the environment. We are refi ning all our processes to do things more resource effi ciently, reducing our carbon footprint each year and making our operations much more sustainable. Be it our drive towards operational excellence or making our products available in various regions around the world, every time I refl ect on the work that we do, I am inspired by the potential we have to create a difference in the lives of patients. The chance to restore the health

of an ailing person, the ability to reach large numbers of people through greater affordability, and the power to listen and respond to unmet needs of patients: these are really the opportunities we have in our everyday work!

Our purpose of accelerating access to affordable and innovative medicines continues to inspire us each day, provides objectivity in all our decisions, and keeps our moral compass fi rmly pointed in the right direction.

Best wishes,

## Operational Excellence

At Dr. Reddy's, we have set ourselves a purpose of accelerating access to affordable and innovative medicines, because Good Health Can't Wait. To this end, we have committed ourselves to fi ve promises: to bring expensive medicines within reach, to address unmet patient needs, to help patients manage disease better, to work with our partners and help them succeed, and to enable and help our partners to ensure that our medicines are available where needed.

As a Company that strives to be patient centric in its every aspect, we realise that fulfi lling our purpose and keeping our promises calls for a commitment that is shared across our global organisation. It calls for a culture of excellence to permeate every level of the company, in every function, unit and location. It requires an attitude of continuous improvement, wherein employees inherently look to make every operation they are engaged in, better.

Developing and sustaining this culture is what Operational Excellence is all about.

Such a pervasive and enduring transformation does not happen overnight. It emerges out of a strategic vision that is distilled into a welldesigned programme, which is further deconstructed into actionable steps. We defi ned eight pillars on which we would begin building a culture of excellence: People, Safety, Quality, Availability, Productivity, Engineering Excellence, Environment & Community, and Continuous Improvement.

Over the last two years, we have set goals, designed and implemented several programmes for each of these pillars, to instil an abiding desire for accelerated improvement in every employee.

People are the backbone of every organisation. We believe that an empowered individual is one who will strive for excellence. Through initiatives

<!-- image -->

like the Self Managed Te ams on the shop fl oor, the Dr. Reddy's Recognition Centre and alliances with leading universities, we empower, reward and enhance the knowledge and skills of our people. Thus enabling them to give their best, expand their capabilities and grow into leadership roles. In FY2016, we also rolled out the People Management Effectiveness Programme which went a long way in honing the leadership abilities of line managers.

There cannot be excellence without a close focus on quality, to which engineering excellence is inseparably linked. In FY2016, we upgraded our quality incident investigation (QII) system to make it more robust, agile and line-owned, and are taking strides towards digitising the entire value chain from product development to distribution, making in-plant processes error free through automation. Our SEZ plant at Pydibhimavaram, Srikakulam was established with next generation paperless manufacturing technology and we now envisage the migration of all our plants to smart technologies. We have had visible results: we have achieved a fi rst time right status of 95% at our formulations plants.

The assured availability of our products on pharmacy shelves is critical to the fulfi lment of our purpose. This calls for improvements in both productivity and supply chain movement. We initiated the Intelligent Integration project to develop a robust, agile and resilient supply chain system that is wholly integrated from end to end of the value stream. This is yielding promising results and the effort is on to further strengthen it. We institutionalised PACE, a productivity enhancement programme, across the Company and benchmarked ourselves against the best in the world through globally recognised mechanisms such as POBOS (A McKinsey benchmarking tool for pharma). This helped to achieve a sustained increase of the machine productivity at our formulations plants.

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

Annual Report 2015-16

We piloted a business continuity plan and reduced risk through increased environmental and regulatory compliance. We also took decisive steps to ensure the timely completion of all capacity expansion projects.

A safe workplace is a more effi cient and productive workplace and thus is a key driver of excellence. A number of programs and initiatives, such as 'Parivartan' and the 'Safety Star Caps' have instilled a sense of deep ownership across all levels to build an organisational attitude that places a high priority on safety, has zero tolerance towards violations and drives awareness at the shop fl oor.

An aspect of operational excellence that is often overlooked is the impact that an organisation has on the community and the environment. It is not excellence if it contributes to environmental degradation and weakens the local community. At Dr. Reddy's, we take our responsibility to the planet and society very seriously. For instance, all our plants are zero discharge ones, which means that all the liquid waste and effl uent they generate is treated within their premises and reused. We upcycle 86% of our organic waste by identifying and supplying it to other industries, who can use it as raw material. Today, we meet more than 10% of our energy

Corporate Overview

needs from renewable sour ces and this fi gure is growing. Our Corporate Social Responsibility activities go well beyond that stipulated by the Government of India. We primarily focus on three broad areas - education, livelihood and healthcare. In FY2016, more than 12,000 students in rural Telangana benefi tted through our School Improvement Programme. We trained over 7,000 young adults to help them obtain secure livelihood. Through the Community Health Intervention Programme (CHIP), we conducted medical screening camps that benefi tted over 7,500 people across 145 villages. In fact, we are perhaps the only corporate company that has an annual Week of Giving, held in memory of our founder Dr. K Anji Reddy, in which the entire global organisation participates.

The journey to excellence is well underway at Dr. Reddy's. With our sights set on global leadership and plans in place to attain that goal, we are continuously driven to act with dynamism in delivering upon the core belief that we all share:

Good Health Can't Wait.

## METOPROLOL - EXPANDING CAPACITY TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY

The capacity enhancement project of Metoprolol is a great example of how the commitment to our purpose pervades across functions at Dr. Reddy's. It bears testimony to our promise of ensuring our medicines are available where needed and demonstrates how collaboration and teamwork creates shared success.

Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that is used to treat angina (chest pain), hypertension (high blood pressure) and also to treat or prevent heart attacks. As such, it is an essential and life-saving drug.

At Dr. Reddy's we have our own line of Metoprolol Succinate being sold in the US markets.

In 2015, supplies of Metoprolol in the market lagged demand as a result of unexpected disruptions in existing supply channels. A severe shortage was imminent. Colleagues in Dr. Reddy's supply chain were the fi rst to glean this information and brought it to the notice of our manufacturing team to see whether production could be increased to meet the shortfall.

There was another issue. Since demand sometimes exceeded production by as much as 30%, the product had to be shipped by air to ensure timely availability. This further pushed up costs.

After a careful analysis of the market situation, the teams concluded that we

## RESULTS OF THE ACTION PLAN

<!-- image -->

Machine cleaning time, a critical part of the process, was reduced from 21 hours to 13, while still keeping the machines contaminant free and sterile to the required standards.

would have to increase our capacity by 50% - from 50 million tablets per month to 75 million, in order to halve the shortfall, at the very least.

This was no easy task and we would have to move fast as well.

A Lean-Six Sigma project was initiated to identify how we could accelerate the manufacturing process and increase output. After carefully de-constructing and analysing the entire process fl ow, the team identifi ed three major issues that were impacting productivity: waiting time for quality control, machine cleaning time and agglomerate screening time. Further, the lack of fl exibility in batch size options was hampering our ability to meet the market demand for different dosage strengths.

The team rapidly put an action plan in place to tackle these problems, with telling results.

- · Machine cleaning time, a critical part of the process, was reduced from 21 hours to 13, while still keeping the machines contaminant free and sterile to the required standards.
- · Quality control waiting time was reduced from 11 days to 6.
- · Agglomerates screening times were reduced from 320 hours to just 40 per month.
- · A new variation of 100 mg tablets was optimised and the rejection of excess OCP pellets was reduced by 40 kg per batch.

Agglomerates screening times were reduced from 320 hours to just 40 per month.

A Lean-Six Sigma project was initiated to identify how we could accelerate the manufacturing process and increase output.

Overall, the product lead time was reduced from 25 days to 18, and 5 days were made available for capacity enhancement.

With these measures in place, we were able to enhance our production from 45 million tablets a month to 71 million, which went a long way in ensuring that this essential drug was available on pharmacy shelves when patients needed it.

A new variation of 100 mg tablets was optimised and the rejection of excess OCP pellets was reduced by 40 kg per batch.

## ZEMBRACE TM SYMTOUCH TM AND SERNIVO TM SPRAY - KEEPING PATIENTS AT THE CENTRE OF PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TO HELP THEM MANAGE DISEASE BETTER

Helping patients manage disease better calls for a close understanding of not just the diseases, but how they affect patients' lives and what they expect as outcomes. The latter often being much more than managing symptoms. It also calls for sustained effort, intensive interaction with patients and doctors, and close collaboration between various functions and teams. Ultimately, it entails thinking beyond medicine.

Zembrace TM SymTouch TM , the sumatriptan self-injector to treat migraine, and Sernivo TM spray, the topical steroid to treat plaque psoriasis, both recently launched in the US, demonstrate how well we make this happen at Dr. Reddy's.

The story of these products started in 2009, when a team of scientists, formulators, clinicians and marketers, from our wholly-owned subsidiary Promius Pharma and the Proprietary Products group, came together with one goal - to build an R&D pipeline of proprietary products, and become a key driver of growth.

The team zeroed in on two areas of focus - dermatology and neurology, more specifi cally plaque psoriasis and migraine. Both these conditions presented

## PROBLEM

<!-- image -->

interestingly similar challenges. They both have multiple subgroups of patients, who have diverse needs, though they suffer from the same ailment. The intensity of each disease episode varies and the symptomatic manifestation can be different too.

People with plaque psoriasis experience a lot of discomfort, both physical and emotional. The condition causes itchiness and pain, it can be very unsightly as well and its occurrence is very uncertain. On the other hand, those who suffer from acute migraine endure severe headaches which may be accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. They are often forced to confi ne themselves to a room for hours on end.

The team realised that they needed to understand the patients' needs more closely - how they managed their conditions, their journey through the diagnosis and treatment process, their frustrations with their medication, and ultimately what outcomes they really desired. After several rounds of interactions with patients and doctors, the team discovered that, more than a cure, patients were most concerned about being able to resume their normal lives as quickly as possible.

## INSIGHT

<!-- image -->

Zembrace TM SymTouch TM comes as a boon to the many migraine patients, who were dissatisfi ed with the drug in pill form.

What followed was an exemplary display of cross functional collaboration. The R&D, IP/Legal, Marketing and Manufacturing teams put their heads together, and developed Zembrace TM SymTouch TM and Sernivo TM Spray, from concept to commercialisation, in a record time of three years.

Zembrace TM SymTouch TM comes as a boon to the many migraine patients, who were dissatisfi ed with the drug in pill form because of associated conditions such as nausea, or because they wanted much quicker relief.

Sernivo™ Spray represents a similar approach to helping patients, with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, get back to normal by providing symptomatic relief. An elegant cosmetic spray, it has a much higher safety profi le and is the industry's fi rst mid-potent topical steroid to treat psoriasis.

## ZOLEDRONIC ACID - ENHANCING PRODUCTION AND SUPPLY TO MEET PATIENT NEEDS

Creative thinking and collaboration with partners enabled Dr. Reddy's to help avert a critical shortage of a vital drug in the United Kingdom (UK), Zoledronic acid, used to treat osteoporosis and Paget's disease of the bone in adults.

Zoledronic acid solution for infusion was put on the national critical shortage list when the existing supplier that covered 80% of the UK market demand was unable to continue supply to the Department of Health (DoH). As a result, clinics had to delay or decline treatment to patients.

The DoH and Dr. Reddy's began a collaboration to fi nd ways to address this national crisis, since the company also supplied this product in the UK (except Northern Ireland) at the time. Increasing production by fi ve times was possible, but it would require a few months to implement, while the current supply would run out in a few weeks at the regular levels of demand across England, Scotland and Wales. The need for a solution became urgent.

In order to meet this challenge, a strategy was devised to manage the supplies available without compromising care to patients. The team at Dr. Reddy's together with the DoH, NHS Pharmacy Procurement

## THE PROCEDURE

Dr. Reddy's Customer Services team worked closely with specialist centres and analysed the historical data across the UK to determine the average number of orders per month.

Understood which hospitals had the greatest clinical need.

Leads and wholesalers, began to leverage their individual capabilities to arrive at a solution.

By working together, they were able to analyse the historical data across the UK to determine the average number of orders per month and to understand which hospitals had the greatest clinical need. Then, a process was devised and implemented with wholesalers to optimise volumes for each hospital, based on criticality of the requirement. This process was modifi ed for specialist centres so they could order additional medicines that exceeded their assigned volume. The Dr. Reddy's Customer Services team worked closely with those specialist centres to make available an additional supply of medicine on a justifi ed, case-by-case basis.

As a result, even though there was a limited supply of Zoledronic acid, the UK never ran out of the medicine, and those that were in critical need got the medicines they required. This strategy also gave Dr. Reddy's the time needed to increase production fi ve-fold. Starting July 2016, hospitals will receive their regular volumes from wholesalers and Zoledronic acid will be available across the UK.

A process was devised and implemented with wholesalers to optimise volumes for each hospital, based on criticality of the requirement.

This process was modifi ed for specialist centres so that they could order additional medicines that exceeded their assigned volume.

## GLOBAL GENERICS "INTELLIGENT INTEGRATION" SUPPLY CHAIN PROJECT - ACHIEVING PROCESS EXCELLENCE TO ENSURE MEDICINE AVAILABILITY

The most effi cacious medicine in the world is of little use if it isn't in the pharmacy when patients need it. This is why, at Dr. Reddy's, we have committed ourselves to enable and help our partners ensure that our medicines are available when needed. The Global Generics 'Intelligent Integration' project, initiated by our Supply Chain team, offers proven evidence of the strength of our commitment to keep this promise.

Today, we live in globally connected and yet volatile times. Consequently, a problem in any one region can trigger a ripple effect across the world. Supply Chain Management plays a critical role in ensuring that the entire product journey, from factory to pharmacy, happens seamlessly and shields patients from any unforeseen market dynamics.

Evolving such a system for Dr. Reddy's is a complex process as we are a global organisation with decentralised manufacturing and a market reach that is as deep as it is wide. Yet this very structure made it all the more essential for us to have a tight, future proof system.

Colleagues in Supply Chain initiated the 'i^2 - Intelligent Integration' project to drive end to end supply chain integration for Dr. Reddy's Global Generics business. It had to be implemented across the global supply chain and would necessarily cover every single Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) across plants and locations.

The team studied the existing system closely, identifi ed areas that needed to be optimised and created tangible success on the ground. The team decided to embed end to end integrated planning solutions such as SAP APO and execution systems like SAP ECC with pharma specifi c supply chain optimisation logic and business rules. It worked like magic.

Today all back end supply chain activities are driven wholly by forecasts. The network is modelled on realistic lead times and preferred shipment modes.

By using differentiated planning logic, we can now ensure that planning & execution always happens as per business priorities. All factory resources are modelled with their capacity constraints, to realise a feasible constrained production plan for the next 6 months. Production is scheduled for 4 weeks on a rolling basis, with the fi rst week's plan being frozen. This gives stability to the shop fl oor as well as fl exibility to react to changes rapidly. Also, strategic business plans are reviewed for potential supply constraints so that proactive action can be taken to resolve bottlenecks.

Optimal safety stock norms have been defi ned to ensure that only necessary inventory levels are maintained. Further, net requirements for each SKU are calculated on a monthly basis, at each node of the supply chain, to avoid both low and excess stock situations.

We have been able to maintain and improve On Time In Full (OTIF) delivery in all key markets, achieving 97% in North America and 92% in Russia.

Finally, the health of the supply chain is continuously assessed using real time analytics, so that its performance can be optimised rapidly.

The proof of the project is in the execution and the business impact is telling. We have been able to maintain and improve On Time In Full (OTIF) delivery in all key markets, achieving 97% in North America and 92% in Russia. Inventory levels have come down considerably without affecting customer service levels. The Cost of Poor Execution (COPE) reduced by 22% from the previous year. We now make more effi cient use of manpower - manual intervention is less than 10% in production planning in our FTOs and has reduced by 74% in the creation of Procurement Requisitions. Transfer price invoices are now generated automatically for all intercompany transactions, which minimises compliance risks and accelerates export procedures. Finally, sea shipments have increased in Russia from 60% to 81%, in Romania from 25% to 79%, in Ukraine from 10% to 59%, in UK from 30% to 58% and in Germany from 35% to 46%, further bringing down costs.

## MEDZNAT - HELPING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IN RUSSIA STAY ON TOP OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENTS IN THEIR FIELD

Medznat, our digital information platform in Russia, bears excellent testimony to our commitment to work with our partners and help them succeed.

Today, medical science and healthcare are evolving at a rapid pace. Every day giant strides are being made in our understanding of the human systems, of diseases, their possible causes, and cure. Yet, information about these advancements is fragmented, spread across various sources, and not always available in all languages. It is extremely diffi cult for healthcare professionals to keep pace with them, as they are always hard pressed for time.

Recognising this latent need of healthcare professionals in Russia, we launched Medznat, a mobile and web based App that enables doctors to keep up to date with the latest scientifi c knowledge and insights relevant to their practice. Based on the doctor's areas of interest, Medznat automatically presents information ranging from medical news, regulatory updates, case studies, full-text articles, procedural demonstration, scientifi c reviews, smart guidelines, drug fl ashcards, and other useful material. All the content is carefully curated from highly credible sources, translated into a simple and concise form in Russian and English, and presented as text, audio or video. The application also has features that allow users to easily share information for patients on managing their disease, have

ready access to drug information and simplifi ed management guidelines, and keep track of important conferences.

Interestingly, the name of the App has been formed by combining Med, for medicine, with znat, a word which means 'know' in Russian and other Slavic languages, together connoting Medical Knowledge.

Medznat was launched in April 2016 and has already received very positive feedback from experts in the fi eld. Among other benefi ts, they found it to have wellthought out features that are not available anywhere else, truly helping them save a lot of time.

Given our knowledge and expertise in the area of pain management, we focused our efforts in this therapy area fi rst. However, with the number of healthcare professionals using Medznat rising exponentially every week, requests have been pouring in to extend it to other therapy areas as well. This is something that the Medznat team is currently working on and the future should see the application serving as a comprehensive resource of up to date medical information for healthcare practitioners.

Medznat is yet another service from Dr. Reddy's that demonstrates the empathy with which we approach our work to address unmet needs, driven by our belief that Good Health Can't Wait.

(1) FY2016 represents fi scal year 2015-16, from 1 April 2015 to 31 March 2016, and analogously for FY2015 and previously such labeled years. (2) Unless otherwise stated, fi nancial data given in this Management Discussion and Analysis is based on the Company's consolidated IFRS statements.

To be able to do this we are perpetually working towards fulfi lling our fi ve promises:

- 2. Address unmet patient needs.
- 1. Bring expensive medicines within reach.
- 3. Help patients manage diseases better.
- 5. Work with partners to help them succeed.
- 4. Enable and help our partners ensure that medicines are available where needed.

Our three key core business segments:

- Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI) consists of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) and Custom Pharmaceutical Services (CPS) businesses.
- Global Generics (GG) includes branded and unbranded prescription and Over-The-Counter (OTC) drug products business and also includes the operations of our Biologics business.
- Proprietary Products (PP) comprises of our Differentiated Formulations business and our New Chemical Entities (NCEs) business in the therapeutic areas of dermatology and neurology.

Dr. Reddy's has a strong presence in highly regulated and developed markets such as the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Germany. We also have a signifi cant pharmaceuticals business in India, Russia, and certain key emerging economies.

There were three main reasons for the Company's subdued fi nancial performance in FY2016.

The fi rst has to do with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA's) inspections. Between November 2014 and March 2015, USFDA inspected three of Dr. Reddy's plants (two API sites at Srikakulam and Miryalguda and one Onco formulations site at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam). In November 2015, the USFDA issued a warning letter to which the Company responded within 15 days with a comprehensive plan of corrective and remedial actions. Subsequent work on these three facilities has resulted in delayed launches of key products, such as Esomeprazole and Capecitabine, as well as certain APIs which, in turn, signifi cantly lowered incremental revenues; and the additional costs of

' 5.09 billion. It needs to be emphasized that Dr. Reddy's will continue to actively engage with the Venezuelan government to provide medicine for the country, subject to regular repatriation of funds.

## A SNAPSHOT OF PERFORMANCE GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

- Revenues from North America was ' 75.4 billion recording a year-onyear growth of 19% , mainly due to the sustained performance of the Company's injectable franchise and market share gains in key molecules.
- Revenues from GG for FY2016 grew by 7% to ' 128.1 billion , driven primarily by North America, India and Europe.
- 14 new generics were fi led in the USA during FY2016, of which 13 were Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and 1 was a New Drug Application (NDA). Cumulatively, 82 generic fi lings are pending for approval with the USFDA, of which 79 are ANDAs and 3 are NDAs. Of the 79 ANDAs, 52 are Para IV fi lings, and we believe that 18 of these have 'First-to-File' status.
- Revenues from Russia were ' 10.6 billion, representing a year-on-year decline of 29% due to the country's economic slowdown and the falling rouble. In constant currency terms, revenues grew by 1%.

conducting the necessary remedial work reduced profi ts.

The second reason has to do with Russia. In last year's Management Discussion and Analysis , we stated that revenues from Russia and other CIS markets had declined by 11% primarily due to economic problems in the country and the sharp devaluation of the rouble. Matters have worsened with the price of Brent crude falling to an average of US$ 47 per barrel for FY2016, the lowest in the last 12 years. As indicated in

Chart A , the rouble-US dollar exchange rate has depreciated further. This resulted in a further decline of 29% in the Company's revenues from Russia to ' 10.6 billion in FY2016.

The third is due to the situation in Venezuela. Dr. Reddy's has enjoyed a sound business in providing affordable medicine to the people of Venezuela. However, the continuing economic crisis in the country has resulted in the government imposing severe constraints on foreign exchange outfl ows. Consequently, like many others that were doing business in that country, we did not receive any approvals from the Venezuelan government to repatriate any amount beyond US$ 4 million in the course of FY2016. Given this situation, the Company decided that, as a matter of abundant precaution, it was more appropriate to use the DICOM rate (at VEF 272.5 = US$ 1) than the offi cial 'preferential' rate of VEF 10 = US$ 1 for translating the monetary assets and liabilities of its Venezuelan subsidiary as on 31 March 2016. The resultant impact of this write-down together with the offi cial devaluation (6.3 to 10) for FY2016 was

- Revenues from Emerging Markets declined by 25% to ' 23.6 billion mainly due to the depreciation of the Russian rouble, the Ukrainian hryvnia and the decision to calibrate sales in Venezuela.

CHART A: RUB/US$

<!-- image -->

- Revenues from other CIS countries and Romania grew by 1% to ' 3.5 billion.
- Revenues from India grew by 19% to ' 21.3 billion . This business saw continued momentum of the Company's mega-brands. The portfolio of pharmaceutical products acquired from UCB has been integrated with those of Dr. Reddy's and the performance of the acquired business is in line with expectations.
- Revenues from the Rest of the World (RoW) territories fell by 28% and stood at ' 9.4 billion, mainly due to the calibrated sales in Venezuela.
- Revenues from Europe grew by 19% to ' 7.7 billion , mainly on account of Aripiprazole and Pregabalin.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

- 50 Drug Master Files (DMFs) wer e fi led globally, of which 8 were in the USA. The cumulative number of DMF fi lings as on 31 March 2016 was 768.
- Revenues from PSAI were at ' 22.4 billion, experiencing a year-onyear decline of 12%.

## OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

- The volume of medicines used globally is expected to reach 4.5 trillion doses by 2020. Consequently, the value of the overall pharmaceutical market will cross $ 1.4 trillion. This represents a growth of 29% - 32% over 2015.

An IMS Health publication, titled 'Global Medicines Use in 2020: Market Prognosis' (September 2015) sets out expected trends for the next four to fi ve years. Below is a synopsis:

- In absolute terms, developed markets will continue to lead in medicine spending, and use more original branded products and specialty medicines per capita.
- The largest growth however, will come from the Pharmerging markets, supported by a sharp increase in broadbased health system expenditures. These markets will use more branded generics and OTC medicines.

Please refer Table 1 for the Estimates of Global Pharmaceutical Spends for 2020.

Other forecasts for this fi ve-year-period are as follows:

- New medicines will be weighted more in favour of specialty and biologics.
- Use of medicines in 2020 will include more than 900 new active substances that have been introduced in the past 20-25 years.
- By 2020, patients will have greater access to breakthrough therapies and clusters of innovation around diabetes, hepatitis C, heart, autoimmune and orphan diseases.
- While global medicine spending on orphan drugs is expected to be 1-2%, it will be as much as 10% in developed markets such as the USA.
- Cancer treatments will constitute the largest category of the 225 new medicines expected to be introduced within the next fi ve years.

## MEDICAL OUTLOOK IN THE USA POSITIVE TRENDS FOR INDIAN PHARMACEUTICAL MAJORS

- 1. Higher US spends on pharmaceutical products: US spends on medicines will range from US$ 560 billion to US$ 590 billion in 2020, representing a 34% increase in spending over 2015. Growth will be driven by innovation, invoice price increases (offset by off-invoice discounts and rebates) and the impact of loss of exclusivity. For majority of the large Indian generics pharmaceutical companies, anywhere between 40% to 60% of their revenues are generated from the USA. The opportunity landscape in the country can be split into three parts -

Branded drugs expected to go off-patent over the ne xt fi ve years.

With the increase in product complexity, R&D spend per molecule and the time required to establish bio-equivalence have both risen.

Major Indian pharmaceutical companies have increased R&D spend over the past fi ve years, in absolute as well as percentage of sales terms.

On the positive side, companies have starting getting faster responses from the USFDA, and there seems to have been a drop in the number of pending ANDAs.

- are in clinical trials, rapid growth is expected in the foreseeable future.
- 3. GDUFA: The Generics Drugs User Fee Act (GDUFA), 2012, is designed to speed up access to affordable generics medicines to the public and reduce the cost to the industry. The law requires the industry to pay user fees to the USFDA to supplement the costs of reviewing generics drug applications and of inspecting facilities. On the positive side, companies have starting getting faster responses from the USFDA, and there seems to have been a drop in the number of pending ANDAs. Thus, larger Indian companies that have a strong US pipeline should benefi t as approvals accelerate.
- 4. Higher R&D spends: With the increase in product complexity, R&D spend per molecule and the time required to establish bio-equivalence have both risen. To give an example, the product development cost for a complex generic is around US$ 5 million, versus US$ 1 million to US$ 2 million for a simpler fi nal dosage form. Developmental spends on an inhalation, complex injectable or a biosimilar product is much higher. Major Indian pharmaceutical companies have increased R&D spend over the past fi ve years, in absolute as well as percentage of sales terms. While absolute spend is lower than international generics majors like Actavis, Mylan and Teva, a number of Indian pharmaceutical companies, including Dr. Reddy's, spend higher in terms of percentage of sales. Such higher R&D efforts bode well for further introduction of higher value complex generics, proprietary products and biosimilars from India to the global markets.
- 5. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A): M&A continues to be one of the principal growth strategies for the pharmaceutical industry. Most transactions focus on one or more of the following factors: consolidating in the face of pricing pressures; strengthening existing product portfolios; replenishing pipelines depleted by patent expiry; deepening capabilities in priority areas; entering new and/or emerging markets; and acquiring innovative technologies to leverage current
- a) Brands going off-patent: Over the next fi ve years, branded drugs worth US$ 92billion in sales are expected to go offpatent. Generally, drugs nearing patent expiry witness relatively high price increases - now at approximately 9% per annum over the past fi ve years. Such increases should help global generics manufacturers in two ways -
- Pharmacy benefi t managers tend to exclude higher price brands in favour of generics. This trend is accelerating and has a positive rubon effect for the generics pharmaceutical industry.
- It will increase the size of the opportunity landscape. The patent cliff (from 2015 to 2020) has signifi cantly more value compared to fi ve years earlier.
- b) Attractive complex generics products with limited markets and very low competition whose patents had expired earlier: These constitute appealing, 'below the radar' opportunities with a well chosen portfolio, provide sustainable revenues streams.
- c) Under-penetrated alternate dosage forms, such as injectables at 18% of prescription generics (Gx) penetration, inhalants at 23% and transdermal patches at 37%: The large Indian generics companies operating in the USA have started diversifying into these alternate forms.
- 2. Medical devices providing auxiliary support to prescriptions: With a rapid increase in the incidence of critical diseases such as cancer, a corresponding advancement in medical science is the use of certain pre-tests. These tests primarily help to assess possible reactions to new medications and help to tailor a treatment regimen for the patients. The commercial success of drugs such as Herceptin® (trastuzumab) and Gleevec® (imatinib), both of which require testing with companion diagnostics before they can be prescribed, has been a pivotal mover in this fi eld. This space is becoming increasingly attractive and, based on drugs that

assets or generate cost-saving synergies. Until a decade ago, M&A was much more prevalent abroad compared to Indian pharmaceutical companies. More recently, with rising scale and profi tability, Indian companies are generating strong free cash fl ows which are increasingly being leveraged to acquire competitive assets abroad. We believe that the trend will accelerate in the future, though at valuations which may be higher than before. However, there is also a negative effect of Mergers & Acquisitions, which is discussed below under Negative Trends.

## NEGATIVE TRENDS FOR INDIAN PHARMACEUTICAL MAJORS

Channel consolidation and faster ANDA approvals in the USA have begun to exert pricing pressure on generic drugs. Unlike in the past two to three years, where the annual generic drug price infl ation was between 2% to 7.5%, generic drug prices were down by nearly 2% in Q1 CY2016. In the future, except for complex generics with relatively little competition, the likely scenario in the USA will be low generics price rises and a lot more of average annual price declines.

## 1. Generics pricing pressure has begun and is likely to persist:

The top fi ve pharmaceutical distributors in the USA now account for 84% of the market. These include CVS/Caremark/Cardinal (23%), Econdisc (22%), Mckesson (22%), the Walmart Group (10%) and Rite Aid (7%). Having consolidated, these players now exert very strong pricing power on generic drug manufacturers.

## 2. Increased USFDA inspections:

Over the last four years, there has been a signifi cant increase in USFDA inspections of manufacturing facilities outside the USA. Given the relatively large number of manufacturing plants in India supplying generics to the USA, the USFDA has opened an offi ce in India to increase the frequency of inspections and speed up compliance. This has resulted in a noticeably higher frequency of inspections, including those of the Company's facilities. We at

Dr. Reddy's appreciate this increased oversight and are committed to doing all that is necessary to have the very best in Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) norms and operating standards. While such inspections especially the 483 observations and warning letters that sometimes follow - often impose high stoppage and remedial costs on companies being inspected, these eventually help in putting in place and sustaining standards that will hold them in good stead for the future. Having said so, it needs to be understood that the risks of USFDA inspections, adverse reports with 483 observations, warning letters and import alerts have increased substantially for pharmaceutical majors in the emerging markets.

## 3. Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A):

The negative side of M&A are the large deals between international pharmaceutical majors - be these in manufacturing or in the sales channels - that create stronger players in fi eld, who can exercise disproportionate marketing or pricing power on competitors.

## GENERAL TRENDS ACROSS MARKETS

- 1. Ageing populations: This continues to be a critical positive factor for the global pharmaceutical industry. Ageing population, rapid growth of chronic diseases and rising consumer wealth will continue to signifi cantly boost healthcare spending in the foreseeable future. Consider the following demographic data. Between 2015 and 2030, the number of people in the world aged 60 years or over will grow by 56%, from 901 million to 1.4 billion. Over the next 15 years, the number of older persons (aged 60 or more) is expected to grow fastest in Latin America and the Caribbean (with a projected 71% increase), followed by Asia (66%), Africa (64%), Oceania (47%), North America (41%) and Europe (23%). Lower growth in North America and Europe is because the populations there already have a sizeable number of those aged 60 or above. Such people will need greater and more frequent medical interventions than before. Those pharmaceutical majors which have the ability to provide effective medicines at affordable prices will gain from this rapid graying of the world.

Biosimilars approved or in the pipeline globally.

More effi cacious anti-cancer drugs will play an increasing role in the portfolio of all pharmaceutical majors, whether in developed or Pharmerging markets.

- GDP. And the only reason why Venezuela's current account defi cit is at 1.4% of GDP is because authorities have virtually banned any repatriation of funds at the offi cial exchange rate. As mentioned earlier, effective embargo on repatriation of funds at the offi cial rate of 10 VEF = US$ 1 is the reason why Dr. Reddy's had to take a substantial provision in translating its net monetary assets in Venezuela. The other country that is going through signifi cant economic turmoil is Russia. On 1 April 2014, the exchange rate was RUB 35.1 = US$ 1. By 31 March 2015, it had dropped to RUB 58.2. And on 31 March 2016, it was at RUB 67.2 = US$1. This, coupled with relatively high infl ation and a freeze, if not reduction, in wages and salaries, has severely affected purchasing power, and has led to a sharp reduction in consumer demand - even for essentials such as pharmaceutical products. Hence, a pharmaceutical market that witnessed healthy double-digit growth in constant currency is now growing at low single digits. The third country which is in trouble, though smaller in comparison to Russia and Venezuela, is Ukraine. The economy has sharply contracted; the currency has seriously depreciated; and while there are no currency controls, the balance of payments defi cit has surged to 3.5% of GDP. It remains to be seen how Russia and Venezuela perform with an expected fi rming up of crude oil prices in FY2017.
- 4. Price controls: These are prevalent in many Pharmerging markets. As an example, in April 2010, Russia implemented price controls through a reference price model for prescription drugs, which covered approximately 40% of the market by value. In 2013, India enhanced the scope of price controls from 74 molecules (or 12% of the market by value) to over 350 (some 34% of the market). Over time, we should expect variants of price control regimes to come up in different Pharmerging and developed markets as countries attempt to widen healthcare provisions and support for increasingly ageing populations, while keeping a control on national or local budgets.
- 2. Oncology and biologics: According to IMS Health, by 2020 cancer will account for 11% of patients' spend on global pharmaceutical products, or over US$ 154 billion of sales. More effi cacious anti-cancer drugs will play an increasing role in the portfolio of all pharmaceutical majors, whether in developed or Pharmerging markets. This will not only necessitate a larger number of new fi lings across various geographies for both complex generics and biologics, especially biosimilars, but also faster regulatory decisions on such applications. Already, the development and sales of biosimilars have begun to accelerate, and analysts expect the worldwide biosimilars market to reach anywhere between US$ 25 billion and US$ 35 billion by 2020. The European Union fi rst approved a biologic in 2006; now there are more than 700 biosimilars approved or in the pipeline globally. The USA has been slower in approving biosimilars. Although the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, passed in 2010 as part of the Affordable Care Act, created an abbreviated licensing pathway for biosimilars, it was only in March 2015 that the USFDA approved the fi rst biosimilar product for the US - Zarxio (fi lgrastim-Sandoz), a biosimilar alternative to Amgen's anti-infection drug neupogen. Thus, in September 2015, the manufacturer, Sandoz, began its US market launch for Zarxio, a product that has been sold in Europe since 2006. However, it is expected that the USFDA will increase its speed of biosimilar approvals. In any event, given the upsurge in oncological care throughout the world, there ought to be many more approvals in Europe as well as in the Pharmerging markets.
- 3. Economic stress in major emerging markets: Currently, three Pharmerging markets are going through extremely diffi cult economic conditions. The fi rst is Venezuela, a relatively large market for pharmaceutical products. The economy is in deep trouble. The GDP for Q4 FY2015 declined by ~9%. For 2016, GDP is estimated to shrink further by another 7%. Consumer price infl ation is raging at over 180%. The country's fi scal defi cit is in excess of 14% of

## NORTH AMERICA GENERICS

- Momentum that started with the Company's injectable portfolio towards the end of FY2015 continued through the year.

North America generics continues to be a key growth driver for Dr. Reddy's. Revenues from the region increased by 19% to clock ' 75.4 billion (over US$ 1.1 billion) and comprised 59% of GG revenues This occurred despite customer consolidation and pricing pressures. Some key developments were:

- Launched Esomeprazole Magnesium delayed release capsules of 20 mg and 40 mg (the generic version of Nexium) during the third quarter of FY2016 - an example of successful technology transfer to an alternate site.
- Launched pramiprexole dihydrochloride extended release tablets in various dosages. This is a generic version of Mirapex ER® and used for treating Parkinson's disease.

- Enjoyed market share gains in key molecules such as metoprolol ER and the sumatriptan auto injector, thanks to a fl exible supply chain that backed up fast manufacturing throughput.
- Acquired worldwide intellectual property rights of fondaparinux sodium, a generic anti-coagulant, from Alchemia.
- Witnessed no major downsides in terms of product supplies to the US market consequent to the ongoing remediation activities across our three plants.
- Settled the ongoing litigation on zoledronic acid.
- Going forward, we are working on securing market share gains in esomeprazole magnesium as well as gains or retention across our key molecules, while being in launch readiness for certain important products in FY2017. We are also maturing the Habitrol® franchise and will be embarking on a branded OTC journey. Today, our US OTC business accounts for around 15% of sales. We are working on increasing this share in the years to come.
- Launched memantine hydrochloride tablets in various dosage forms, a generic version of Namenda®, used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

## EUROPE

Revenues from Europe for FY2016 were ' 7.7 billion, and grew by 19% year-on-year. Europe generics accounted for 6% of the GG business. Growth was largely driven by Aripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic primarily used in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and Pregabalin, a medication used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fi bromyalgia, and generalized anxiety disorder.

## INDIA

- In April 2015, Dr. Reddy's had announced a defi nitive agreement for €118 million (approximately ' 8 billion) to buy a select established brands portfolio from UCB group entities for the territories of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The portfolio comprised dermatology, respiratory, ENT and pediatrics diseases. This will further expand Dr. Reddy's therapy footprint into these fast growing areas. The deal was concluded in June 2015. Since then, the task of integrating the UCB portfolio has gone on well in line with expectations. It provides the Company with leading positions in some of the key therapeutic areas.

Revenues from India in FY2016 grew at 19% year-on-year to achieve ' 21.3 billion. It accounted for 17% of GG revenues. The highlights were:

- There have been some focused business development deals. An example is our partnership with Ferrer Internacional S.A. of Spain to introduce Somazina® in India a key medicine used for accelerating recovery and improving cognitive processes of patients who have had brain surgery, cerebral strokes or infarcts or acute head injuries. Another has led to the introduction of Saxagliptin, an oral hypoglycemic (or anti-diabetic) drug.
- Going forward, the business will be focusing on: (i) enhancing the benefi ts of the portfolio acquisition from UCB; (ii) making new product
- We have improved our ranking from 16th to 12th (according to the IMS data). We have also improved our product portfolio mix.

Subsequent to the period end, we have acquired:

- Six well known OTC brands in cough, cold, pain and derma categories from Ducera Pharma.
- Eight ANDAs from Teva/Allergan across various dosage forms for U.S.$ 350 million.

## RUSSIA AND CIS

- Resilient base business performance in an acutely constrained economic and geopolitical environment.

As mentioned earlier, revenues from Russia for FY2016 were ' 10.6 billion, which represented a 29% decline over the previous year primarily due to the depreciation of the rouble. In constant currency terms, revenues grew by 1%. Revenues from other CIS countries (including Romania) was ' 3.5 billion, or a year-on-year growth of 1%. The key performance indicators were:

- Despite adverse conditions in our market, and the early setbacks faced in the year, we responded with dynamism and began our revival. From October 2015, the Company's monthly growth trend is above the Russian market growth rate (as per data from the IMS).
- In prescriptions, Dr. Reddy's is the only company in Russia to grow faster than the market over the last seven successive waves (data from Prescription Audit, November 2015).
- We have witnessed good traction in the OTC channel. While the OTC market de-grew by 5.1%, our sales reduced by only 1% (IMS). At present, 35% of revenues from Russia come from the OTC business.
- All our mega brands in Russia, such as Nise, Omez, Ciprolet, Ketorol, Cetrin and Senade, are leading in their respective categories.
- In Ukraine, Dr. Reddy's continues to be the fastest growing among the top 30 pharmaceutical companies (IMS). We have had a notable biosimilar success. Reditux (rituximab) was launched in June 2015. Already, some 300 new patients have been using
- Going forward, our focus will be on: (i) portfolio augmentation, to reduce the dependence on key molecules; (ii) further strengthening of the OTC portfolio; and (iii) Participated in tenders for Rituximab in Russia (Dr. Reddy's Rituximab is approved in Russia). Securing approval and preparing for launch in other markets.

launches; (iii) building a stronger OTC portfolio with top-of-the-mind brand awareness; and (iv) generating market leading growth on an enhanced base.

## PSAI

- During the year, 50 DMFs were fi led globally, of which 8 were in the USA. The cumulative number of DMF fi lings as on 31 March 2016 were 768.

The PSAI business recorded revenues of ' 22.4 billion in FY2016, which was 12% lower than the previous year. The key developments were:

- The observations made by the USFDA on inspection of the plants are being addressed at a steady pace. However, the corrective and preventive efforts undertaken have impacted output and revenues.
- Going forward, we propose to have best practices in quality management systems across all our CTO locations while expanding on value added offerings across markets.
- Despite lower growth and interruptions at Srikakulam and Miryalguda, the base business continued its momentum and we also secured the support of our key customers.
- We also seek to improve the fi ling profi le of our DMFs to better serve internal as well as external clients.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

- Approved by the USFDA in January 2016, PP launched Zembrace TM SymTouch TM , a sumatriptan 3 mg auto injector in April 2016. Used by patients for the treatment of migraine, this 3 mg ready-to-use subcutaneous injection has four doses over a 24-hour period and should offer more rapid relief to patients. It is an example of addressing an under-met medical need with the product having a superior side effects profi le.

The PP business (including 'others') accounted for ' 4.3 billion in revenues in FY2016, representing a 28% growth over the previous year. It was a very good year for PP.

- After securing a USFDA approval in February 2016, PP launched Sernivo TM , which is a betamethasone dipropionate spray 0.05% in May 2016. It is a prescription topical steroid indicated for mild to moderate plaque psoriasis for

- patients above 18 years of age. This is an example of creating differentiated drug delivery in spray form, where there are none.
- FY2017 will see the PP business gearing up to ensure commercial success of the two new launches while continuing to develop a potentially rich product and R&D pipeline in dermatology and neurology.
- Concluded two in-licensing deals with: (i) XenoPort Inc. of the USA for the development and commercialization of a clinical stage new oral entity that has potential for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and may even be developed for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis; and (ii) Eisai Company Ltd., Japan, for global commercial and development rights (excluding Asia) for an investigational anti-cancer agent.

## USFDA OBSERVATIONS: AN UPDATE

As mentioned earlier, three of our facilities were inspected by the USFDA. They sent a warning letter to the Company citing defi ciencies for which it wanted Dr. Reddy's to evaluate further corrective actions with the help of independent third party specialist consultants and to implement enhanced CAPAs. A detailed response letter was sent to the USFDA listing all our commitments, along with detailed remedial timelines. External specialist consultants have been engaged, and regular updates are being sent to the USFDA. In the process, we have signifi cantly strengthened our Quality Management Systems with the help of experienced third party experts and are developing various in-house subject matter experts at the level of the shop fl oors for sustainability. Though a temporary setback, we are institutionalizing the experiences gained from this remediation exercise to put in place a best-in-class 'One Quality Standard' across all the facilities of the Company. In doing so, Dr. Reddy's should emerge stronger than before.

It needs to be mentioned that Dr. Reddy's is not an exception. There has been a recent wave of regulatory actions on several Indian sites, which arises out of a signifi cant shift in the USFDA's approach from 'what has gone wrong' to 'what can go wrong'. This is a major change in expectations which will require all pharmaceutical companies in India

of the rouble and the euro resulted in lower revenues in the reporting currency. Venezuela's performance was impacted by calibrated revenues - a decision taken by the Company given the constraints in repatriating profi ts at the offi cial exchange rate. The PSAI segment's revenues were primarily impacted by delayed dispatches on account of ongoing remediation activities at Srikakulam and Miryalaguda.

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profi t rose by 8% to ' 92,281 million in FY2016. This translates to a gross profi t margin of 59.6% in FY2016 versus 57.6% in FY2015. The gross profi t margin for Global Generics was 65.9%; and for the PSAI business it was 22%. Factors that positively affected gross profi t margins include new product contribution, incremental export benefi t and favorable product mix.

## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)

SG&A expenses including amortisation increased by 7% to ' 45,702 million in FY2016. This was primarily due to the ongoing remediation activities related to the USFDA's observations, settlement of patent litigation on zoledronic acid, launch related activities of the Proprietary Products business and certain routine items related to manpower and other spends. SG&A accounted for 29.5% of sales in FY2016, which was 80 basis points higher than the previous year.

## R&D EXPENSES

R&D expenses were at ' 17,834 million, or 11.5% of revenues in FY2016 versus 11.8% in FY2015. With respect to the ongoing biosimilars development program for regulated markets in association with Merck Serono, we received our share of development costs and other contractual amounts. Normalized for this, the absolute spend is in line with our efforts to focus on the development of a complex generics and specialized pipeline consisting of niche and differentiated products.

## NET FINANCE EXPENSES

Net fi nance expense was ' 2,708 million in FY2016 versus a net fi nance income of ' 1,682 million in FY2015. This movement is primarily on account of: (i) higher net interest income by ' 701 million, counteracted by (ii) net foreign exchange loss of ' 4,133 million in FY2016

to signifi cantly invest in processes, automation, detailed documentation of each batch and of the Standard Operating Procedures to emerge successfully from inspections. While painful and costly in the short run, this will be eventually very benefi cial for the industry.

## BUYBACK OF SHARES

Given the Company's strong cash fl ow position, its Board of Directors at a meeting held on 17 February 2016, approved a proposal to buyback of equity shares of the Company, subject to approval by the shareholders, for an aggregate amount not exceeding ' 15.69 billion, or up to 14.9% of the total paid-up equity capital and free reserves of the Company as on 31 March 2015, at a price not exceeding ' 3,500 per share. The buyback is open to all shareholders including those who become shareholders by cancelling their American Depository Shares and receiving underlying equity shares, but excludes the promoters and promoter group of the Company. The buyback is being conducted under the open market route according to the provisions given in the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Buy Back of Securities) Regulations, 1998 (as amended).

The maximum buyback price represents an 18.6% premium, compared to the average of the weekly high and low of the closing share price of Dr. Reddy's during the last two weeks up to 16 February 2016. Subsequently, the Company received the requisite approval from shareholders and the buyback process is in progress. The Company has bought and extinguished 350,000 fully paid up equity shares for an aggregate amount of ' 1.09 billion up to the date of this report.

## FINANCIALS

Please refer Table 3 for the Consolidated Financial Performance as per IFRS.

## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS

## REVENUES

Revenues grew by 4% to ' 154,708 million in FY2016. Revenues growth was largely driven by our Global Generics segment's operations in North America, Europe and India. Macroeconomic factors continued to have an impact on key Emerging Market territories. Adverse exchange rate movements, primarily

compared to a net foreign exchange gain of ' 958 million in FY2015. The foreign exchange loss in the current year is mainly due to the Venezuela related adjustments.

## INCOME TAX

For FY2016, income tax expense was ' 7,127 million, implying an effective tax rate of 26.3% versus ' 5,984 million in FY2015 and an effective tax rate of 21.2%.

Normalized for the above, the annual effective tax rate is in line with previous year's rate.

## NET PROFIT

Net profi t decreased by 10% to ' 20,013 million in FY2016. This represents a PAT margin of 12.9% of revenues versus 15% in FY2015.

## VENEZUELA ADJUSTMENT

During FY2016 the Company did not receive approvals from the Venezuelan government to repatriate any amount beyond US$ 4 million already received during the year. Accordingly, the monetary assets and liabilities of the Venezuelan subsidiary have been translated using the DICOM rate (i.e. 272.5 VEF per US$) instead of the offi cial 'preferential' rate (of 10 VEF per US$). The resultant impact for FY2016 was ' 5,085 million. The similar charge on account of translation of net monetary assets was ' 843 million accrued in FY2015.

## EN TERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

- Proactively identify and highlight risks to the right stakeholders;

Dr. Reddy's ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- Facilitate discussions around risk prioritization and mitigation;
- Provide an analysis of residual risk.
- Provide a framework to assess risk capacity and appetite; develop systems to warn when the appetite is being breached.

The ERM team connects with the Company's business units and functions the primary source for risk identifi cation. The ERM team also regularly monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers.

## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MITIGATION AT THE BUSINESS UNIT OR FUNCTION LEVEL

The ERM team focuses on identifi cation of key business, operational and strategic risks, which is carried out through structured interviews, surveys, on-call discussions or incidents. The team collaborates with the Compliance, Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) and Internal Audit teams on operational, compliance, fi nancial reporting and process aspects to identify and mitigate risks of business units. Mitigation is periodically reviewed, and the progress on key risks are discussed at the Company's managementlevel and Board-level Risk Committees.

The ERM team also regularly monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers.

Our People Management Effectiveness Index grew by 400 basis points.

Dr. Reddy's continues to be an employer of choice for women and in order to keep it that way, we are making the workplace at Dr. Reddy's more inclusive through our talent acquisition efforts.

Management (FRM), the team assisted in updating the capital allocation framework and facilitated discussions on hedging the currency risks.

## HUMAN RESOURCES (HR)

Building on the organisation's efforts to provide a distinctive experience to our employees, our focus this year was to strengthen the integrated talent management approach, which aims to acquire, nurture and develop the best talent to prepare them for leadership roles within the organisation.

To achieve this, we took a closer look at our entry level hires - how they are appointed, and career paths they ought to take. We strengthened the touch points at all levels, and deepened the engagement with campuses, a primary source of our entry level hiring. Our efforts were also to provide clear career paths to members of our Self Managed Teams and chalk out an empowerment roadmap for them.

Our fl agship programs like 'Building People Manager's Effectiveness' and 'Developing Next Level Leaders' as part of the New Horizons Leadership Program (NHLP) continued to yield superior levels of employee engagement. We trained our people managers to give feedback and hold career conversations with their colleagues. Our People Management

## RISK AGGREGATION, PRIORITIZATION AND MITIGATION AT THE ORGANISATIONAL LEVEL

Risks are aggregated at the unit/function and organisation level and categorized by risk groups. The Company's response framework categorizes them into: (i) Preventable, (ii) Strategic and (iii) External risks. The Finance, Investment and Risk Management Council (or FIRM Council), is the Company's management committee that helps the ERM function to prioritize organisation-wide risks and steer mitigation efforts in line with the Company's risk capacity and appetite. The FIRM council also oversees fi nancial risk management and capital allocation decisions.

## REVIEWING THE STATUS OF MITIGATION AND RESIDUAL RISKS

The Head of Dr. Reddy's ERM team provides periodic updates to the FIRM Council and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. These include: (i) quarterly updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks; and (ii) specifi c risk-related initiatives carried out during the year.

During FY2016, the ERM team facilitated mitigation of certain geo-political and country risks, and fi rming up cyber security-related controls; including review of other execution risks. On Financial Risk

Effectiveness Index grew by 400 basis points. NHLP, the leadership program which is built on the four tenets of 'Lead Self, Lead Others, Lead Change and Lead Business', saw the graduation of a new batch of leaders.

Our focus on productivity also received impetus, as we benchmarked our performance with the industry and executed organisational design interventions that focused on delayering, reducing spans, sharply defi ning roles and agreeing on tighter manning norms.

Dr. Reddy's continues to be an employer of choice for women and in order to keep it that way, we are making the workplace at Dr. Reddy's more inclusive through our talent acquisition efforts. We also continue to fast-track our high potential women employees to increase diversity at the leadership level.

## OUTLOOK

- a. negative observations of USFDA audits in three facilities two API sites and one onco formulation site, which reduced production from some of these units and led to extensive remediation efforts at higher onetime costs;
- c. the virtual economic collapse, balance of payments crisis and a huge gap between the offi cial exchange rate and the more applicable DICOM rate in Venezuela, which required of us to make substantial provisions on our net assets and receivables in the country.

Without these three factors, Dr. Reddy's would have achieved signifi cantly greater revenues and profi ts.

While it is very diffi cult to predict how the economic situation will evolve in Venezuela, there are now suffi cient indicators to suggest that Russia may be on the mend. If FY2017 exhibits somewhat fi rmer crude oil prices, as most analysts seem to expect, the rouble ought to start appreciating and there could be an uptick in consumer spending. Besides, we have started introducing more complex generics in the pipeline for Russia, have further strengthened our OTC offerings, and are making steady inroads in the institutional business, such as the supply of oral dosages and injectables to hospitals. Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic about our prospects in Russia and CIS for FY2016, and expect the results to be better than those of the current year.

Given the seriousness with which we have engaged in remedial efforts - not just in three facilities but across all manufacturing units of Dr. Reddy's, we hope to adequately satisfy the USFDA when it come to inspect these plants post-remediation.

In FY2016, the Company was affected by three external factors:

- b. continued economic problems in Russia and the depreciated rouble, which limited topline growth in constant currency and shrunk revenues in the reporting currency; and

We have a very attractive pipeline in terms of complex generics offerings and new proprietary product drugs. In FY2017 we aim to leverage these strongly across North America, Europe and Russia, as, along with our biosimilar offerings. We should also increase our OTC portfolio and offerings in the USA, India and Russia; and make concerted forays in creating a branded generics bridgehead in North America. We also expect the PSAI business, especially API manufacturing, to revive and generate greater revenues as well as profi t.

Therefore, in the absence of unforeseen and adverse events, we expect Dr. Reddy's to perform marginally better in FY2017 vis-à-vis the current year.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

The Board, on the recommendations of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, considers the appointment and re-appointment of Directors.

Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013, provides that an Independent Director shall hold offi ce for a term of up to fi ve consecutive years on the Board of a Company and shall be eligible for re-appointment on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders of the Company. However, the Independent Directors shall not retire by rotation.

Accordingly, all the Independent Directors of the Company were appointed as Independent Directors under Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013, for a term ranging from 1-5 years at the 30th Annual General Meeting. Consequently, the term of Mr. Ravi Bhoothalingam, Independent Director, ends at the forthcoming 32nd Annual General Meeting on 27 July 2016.

Section 152 of the Companies Act, 2013, states that one-third of the Board members other than Independent Directors who are subject to retire by rotation, shall retire every year and shall be eligible for re-appointment, if approved by the shareholders at their meeting. Accordingly, at the 30th Annual General Meeting, the Company has amended the terms of appointment of Whole-time Directors, making them liable to retire by rotation.

In view of the above, Mr. K Satish Reddy, Whole-time Director, retires by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, and being eligible, seeks re-appointment.

The Board of Directors at their meeting held on 29 October 2015, had re-appointed Mr. G V Prasad as Whole-time Director designated as Co-Chairman, Managing Director and CEO of the Company. Further, Mr. Bharat Narotam Doshi and Mr. Hans Peter Hasler were appointed an Additional Directors of the Company, categorized as Independent.

In view of the above, approval of the shareholders is being sought for:

- ii. The appointment of Mr. Bharat Narotam Doshi and Mr. Hans Peter Hasler as Independent Directors, under Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013 for a term of fi ve years each, with effect from 11 May 2016 and 17 June 2016 respectively.
- i. The re-appointment of Mr. G V Prasad, as Whole-time Director designated as Co-Chairman, Managing Director and CEO, for a period of fi ve years with effect from 30 January 2016.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Induction of any new member on the Board of Directors is the responsibility of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, consisting entirely of Independent Directors. Considering the existing composition of the Board and requirement of new domain expertise, if any, the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee reviews potential candidates, in terms of their expertise, skills, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings in India. The Committee

then places the details of shortlisted candidates who meet these criteria to the Board for its consideration. If the Board approves, the person is appointed as an Additional Director, subject to the approval of the shareholders in the Company's general meeting.

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new Independent Director with the Company, a kit containing informative documents about the Company like Annual Reports, Sustainability Reports, investor presentations, recent press releases, research reports, Memorandum and Articles of Association, etc. are provided to him/her. The new Independent Director meets individually with Board members and senior management. Visits to plant location(s) are also organized for the new Director to understand the Company's operations.

The Company believes that the Board should be continuously empowered with the knowledge of latest developments affecting the Company and the industry as a whole. Apart from the periodic presentations on Company's business strategies and risks involved,

presentations are also made on topics covering the pharmaceutical industry, peer study on specialty pharma model, etc. They also visit manufacturing and research locations of the Company. Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial pronouncements around important industry related laws are regularly circulated to the Directors. Each Director of the Company has complete access to any Company's information and freedom to interact with the senior management.

The details of the familiarization programs imparted to Independent Directors are available on the Company's website www.drreddys.com/media/325297/ familliarization-process-2016.pdf

A 360 degree feedback cum-assessment of individual Directors, the Board as a whole and its Committees was discussed and collective action points for improvement were put in place. The peer ratings on certain parameters, positive attributes and improvement areas for each Board member were also provided to them in a confi dential manner.

## Management's Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal fi nancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the fi nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

## ANNEXURE B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company") as of 31 March 2016 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal fi nancial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over fi nancial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company' s internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fi nancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## ANNEXURE B TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2016, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by ICAI.

Examples of such estimates include estimation of useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, valuation of inventories, assessment of recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets and cash generating units, provision for sales returns, provision for obligations relating to employees, provisions against litigations and contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

## c) Current and non current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets / liabilities include the current portion of non current assets / liabilities respectively. All other assets / liabilities are classified as non current.

## d) Tangible fi xed assets and depreciation

Tangible fi xed assets are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fi xed assets includes non refundable taxes, duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the respective assets.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible fixed asset is capitalised only if it increases the future benefits from the existing assets beyond its previously assessed standards of performance.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the assets as estimated by the Company's management. Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of installation till the date the assets are sold or disposed.

Assets acquired on finance leases and lease hold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life whichever is shorter. Land is not depreciated.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of fixed assets are given below:

|                                           | Years    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                 |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings    | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                    | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and machinery                       | 3 to 15  |
| Electrical equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Laboratory equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                  | 4 to 5   |

Gains or losses from disposal of tangible fixed assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are differentGLYPH<nobreakspace>from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

Advances paid towards acquisition of tangible fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are shown under long term loans and advances. Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on the balance sheet date, is shown as capital work-in-progress.

## e) Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of those fixed assets which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by the Company in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.

## f) Intangible assets and amortisation

Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition including any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing authorities), and any directly attributable expenditure in making the asset ready for its intended use.

Intangible assets are amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for its use.

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of intangible assets are given below:

|                                                                    | Years   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Goodwill                                                           | 14      |
| Customer contracts                                                 | 2 to 5  |
| Technical know-how                                                 | 10      |
| Product related intangibles                                        | 5 to 15 |
| Copyrights and Patents (including marketing / distribution rights) | 3 to 15 |
| Others                                                             | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed at least at each financial year end. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from previous estimates, the amortisation period is changed accordingly.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal. Gains or losses arising from the disposal of intangible assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## g) Investments

Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made, are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as non current investments.

Current investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value. The comparison of cost and fair value is done separately in respect of each individual investment.

Non current investments are carried at cost less any other-than-temporary diminution in value, determined separately for each individual investment. The reduction in the carrying amount is reversed when there is a rise in the value of the investment or if the reasons for the reduction no longer exist. Any reduction in the carrying amount and any reversal in such reductions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## h) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). Cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchase, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. The cost of all categories of inventory is determined using weighted average cost method. NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

## i) Research and development

Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if:

- a) the product or the process is technically and commercially feasible;
- b) future economic benefits are probable and ascertainable;
- c) the Company intends to and has sufficient resources, technical and financial, to complete development of the product and has the ability to use or sell the asset; and
- d) development costs can be measured reliably.

## j) Employee benefi ts

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The long term obligations are measured at present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations. Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

All actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## Other long term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Defined contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Compensated leave of absence

The Company provides for accumulation of compensated absences by certain categories of its employees. These employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof as per Company policy. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The measurement of such obligation is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Employee stock option schemes

In accordance with the SEBI guidelines, the cost is calculated based on intrinsic value method i.e., the excess of the market price of shares, at the date prior to the day of grant of options under the Employee stock option schemes, over the exercise price is treated as employee compensation and amortised over the vesting period.

## k) Foreign currency transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the respective transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date are reported using the foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. The resultant exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non monetary assets and liabilities are carried at the rates prevailing on the date of transaction.

Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of the Company's net investment in a non integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve in the Company's financial statements. Such exchange differences are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the event of disposal of the net investment.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## l) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The premium or discount on foreign exchange forward contracts is amortized as income or expense over the life of the contract. The exchange difference is calculated and recorded in accordance with AS 11 (revised) "The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" in the statement of profi t and loss. The changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts and swap contracts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as they arise. Fair value of such option contracts and swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques considering the terms of the contract.

Pursuant to ICAI Announcement "Accounting for Derivatives" on the early adoption of AS 30 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement", the Company has adopted the Standard, to the extent that the adoption does not conflict with existing mandatory accounting standards and other authoritative pronouncements, the Companies Act, 2013 and other regulatory requirements.

## Cashfl ow hedges

The Company classifi es its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified into the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classifi ed in the statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, gets expired or is sold, terminated or exercised before the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, the hedge accounting on such transaction is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in hedging reserve continues to remain there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the balance in hedging reserve is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## m) Revenue recognition

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is reasonably certain, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances.

Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

## Sales returns

The Company accounts for sales returns by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates.

## Profit share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognized in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognized as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profi t share is available.

## Service Income

Service income is recognised as per the terms of contracts with customers when the related services are performed, or the agreed milestones are achieved.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Dividend and interest income

Dividend income is recognised when the unconditional right to receive the income is established. Income from interest on deposits, loans and interest bearing securities is recognised on a time proportion basis.

## Export incentives

Export incentives are recognised as reduction from cost of material consumed when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## n) Income tax expense

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.

## Current tax

The current charge for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the relevant tax regulations applicable to the Company.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax charge or credit reflects the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period. The deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future; however, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is a virtual certainty of realisation of such assets.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are written-down or written-up to reflect the amount that is reasonably/virtually certain (as the case may be) to be realised.

## Minimum Alternate Tax

Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credit is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period. Such asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the carrying amount of the MAT credit asset is written down to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specifi ed period.

## o) Earnings per share

The basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net profit after tax for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net profit after tax for the year and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. The diluted potential equity shares have been adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e., the average market value of the outstanding shares).

## p) Provisions and contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## q) Impairment of assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (Cash Generating Unit or CGU) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its net selling price. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.

If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of amortised historical cost .

## r) Leases

At the inception of the lease, a lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an asset. A finance lease is recognized as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalized and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

## s) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment.

- (b) Terms / rights attached to equity shares

The Company has only one class of equity shares having a par value of ' 5 per share. Each holder of equity shares is entitled to one vote per share. The Company declares and pays dividends in Indian rupees. During the year ended 31 March 2016, the amount of per share dividend recognized as distributions to equity shareholders is ' 20 (previous year: ' 20). The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to the approval of the shareholders in the ensuing Annual General Meeting. Further, the total number of shares considered for dividend is after giving effect to the number of shares that are bought back by the Company pursuant to the share buyback scheme commenced on 18 April 2016 (Refer note 2.45). In the event of liquidation, the equity shareholders are eligible to receive the remaining assets of the Company after distribution of all preferential amounts, in proportion to their shareholding.

(d) DPCO matters

The Company is contesting various demands for payment to the credit of the Drug Prices Equalisation Account under Drugs (Price Control) Order (DPCO), 1995 for few of its products, including norfloxacin. Based on its best estimate, the Company has made a provision for the potential liability related to the allegedly overcharged amount including the interest thereon and believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of penalty on this demand is not probable. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in its litigation in the Supreme Court, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and including penalties, if any, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (e) Fuel surcharge adjustment

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded an amount of ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. As of 31 March 2016, the Company has made "payments under protest" of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

## (f) Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Company believes that the possibility of additional liability is remote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company along with the alleged polluting industries have challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

## (g) Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along-with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board ("APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specified by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (h) Assessable value of products supplied by a vendor to the Company

During the year ended 31 March 2003, the Central Excise Authorities of India (the "Central Excise Authorities") issued a demand notice to a vendor of the Company regarding the assessable value of products supplied by this vendor to the Company. The Company has been named as a co-defendant in this demand notice. The Central Excise Authorities demanded payment of ' 176 from the vendor, including penalties of ' 90. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 70 against the Company. During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 226 from the vendor, including a penalty of ' 51. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 7 against the Company. Furthermore, during the year ended 31 March 2006, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 34. The Company filed appeals against these notices with the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the "CESTAT"). In October 2006, the CESTAT passed an order in favor of the Company setting aside all of the above demand notices. In July 2007, the Central Excise Authorities appealed against CESTAT's order in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi.

On 27 November 2015, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the appeal of the Central Excise Authorities and passed an order in favor of the Company.

The Company believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the Company's financial statements as at 31 March 2016.

## (j) Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company received various show cause notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such show cause notices and the consequential actions on and status of the same.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded        | Status                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| April 2006 to March 2009          | '  66 plus 10% penalty | The Company has filed an appeal before the Sales Tax  Appellate Tribunal.                                                                                                                |
| April 2009 to March 2011          | '  59 plus 10% penalty | The Company has filed an appeal before the Sales Tax  Appellate Tribunal.                                                                                                                |
| April 2011 to March 2013          | '  16 plus 10% penalty | The Appellate Deputy Commissioner issued an order  partially in favour of the Company. In January 2016, the  Assistant Commissioner issued an order partially in favour  of the Company. |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 27 as of 31 March 2016, and believes that the possibility of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various show cause notices from the Indian Sales Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 57. The Company has responded to such show cause notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in the Company's financial statements as at 31 March 2016.

## (k) Direct tax matter

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Indian Income Tax authorities disallowed for tax purposes certain business transactions entered into by the parent company with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The associated tax impact is ' 570. The Company believes that such business transactions are allowed for tax deduction under Indian Income Tax laws and has accordingly filed an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Authorities. The Company further believes that the probability of succeeding in this matter is more likely than not and therefore no provision was made in respect of this matter in the Company's financial statements as at 31 March 2016.

Additionally, the Company is contesting various other disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 845. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavourable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and accordingly, no provision was made in respect of these matters in the Company's financial statements as at 31 March 2016.

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>5 per option).

The fair market value of a share on each grant date falling under Category A above is defined as the average closing price (after adjustment of Bonus issue) for 30 days prior to the grant, in the stock exchange where there was highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after getting the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the issue of bonus shares by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock options granted in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|
| Options reserved under original plan                              | 300,000                               | 1,995,478                             | 2,295,478 |

| Options arising from issue of bonus shares (C)                    | 205,939                               | 1,847,685                             | 2,053,624 |
| Total options after bonus shares (A+B+C)                          | 505,939                               | 3,843,163                             | 4,349,102 |

In the case of termination of employment, all unvested options would stand cancelled. Options that have vested but have not been exercised can be exercised within the time prescribed under each option agreement by the Committee or if no time limit is prescribed, within three months of the date of employment termination, failing which they would stand cancelled.

The term of the DRL 2002 Plan was extended for a period of 10 years with effect from 29 January 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company under the DRL 2002 Plan has issued 102,224 Category B options to eligible employees. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

The date of grant, number of options granted, exercise price fixed by the Committee for respective options and the market price of the shares of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant are given below:

| DATE OF GRANT   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED   |   EXERCISE PRICE  ' | MARKET PRICE  ' (AS PER SEBI GUIDELINES)   |

The Company has not granted any options under Category A of "the DRL 2007 Plan".

In addition to the above, during the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company adopted a new program to grant performance linked stock options to certain employees under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan. Under this program, performance targets are measured each year against pre-defi ned interim targets over the three year period ending on 31 March 2017 and eligible employees are granted stock options upon meeting such targets. The stock options so granted are ultimately vested with the employees who meet subsequent service vesting conditions which range from 1 to 4 years. After vesting, such stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years. The details of grants made under this program are included in the above tables under the respective plans.

Till 30 September 2015, the Company accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic method of accounting available under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 1999. Effective 1 October 2015, the Company applied Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014, which require the employee stock options to be accounted under the Guidance note on Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Consequent to such change, deferred employee stock compensation account has been de-recognised to confirm to the new accounting pronouncement.

The Company followed intrinsic method of accounting based on which a compensation expense of ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>455 (previous year: ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>519) was recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Had the Company used the fair value method, the compensation expense would have been ' 471. The differential stock compensation expense of ' 16 does not have any significant effect on the net results and EPS of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016.

## Valuation of stock options under fair value method:

The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted under category B, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term, contractual term, as well as expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted under category A, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions refl ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

| Expected volatility     | 25.98%      |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Exercise price          | '  5.00     |
| Option life             | 2.5 Years   |
| Risk-free interest rate | 7.87%       |
| Expected dividends      | 0.60%       |
| Grant date share price  | '  3,359.70 |

## 2.35 HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Russian roubles and Euros, and foreign currency debt in U.S. dollars, Russian roubles and Euros.

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, the Company also uses non derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. In respect of the aforesaid foreign exchange derivative contracts, the Company has recorded, as part of foreign exchange gains and losses, a net gain of ' 275 and ' 1,040 for the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015 respectively.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

In respect of the aforesaid hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions, the Company has recorded, in reserves and surplus, a net loss of ' 66 and a net gain of ' 51 for the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company also recorded, as part of revenue, a net gain of ' 299 and a net gain of ' 810 during the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The net carrying amount of the Company's "hedging reserve" was a loss of ' 20 as at 31 March 2016, as compared to a gain of ' 46 as at 31 March 2015.

The table below summarises the periods when the forecasted cash flows associated with hedging instruments that are classified as cash flow hedges, are expected to occur:

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. As at 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015, the maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables is ' 38,935 and ' 47,117, respectively (net of allowances).

## Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired

Trade receivables amounting to ' 25,826 and ' 28,687 were neither past due nor impaired as at 31 MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2016 and 31 March 2015 respectively.

## Trade receivables that are past due but not impaired

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The age analysis of the trade receivables has been considered from the due date of the invoice. The ageing of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired is given below:

During the year ended 31 March 2016, the economic conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate thereby significantly increasing the risk of default by the Venezuelan subsidiary. The Company has not been successful in obtaining approvals from the Venezuelan government to repatriate any amount beyond USD 4 million already received during the year. Consequent to such deteriorated economic condition, the Company believes that the amount receivable from Venezuelan subsidiary is no longer recoverable and accordingly an amount of ' 3,559, representing the amount receivable from Venezuelan subsidiary has been fully provided during the three months ended 31 March 2016 and the same has been presented under exceptional items in the statement of profit and loss.

## Financial guarantees

Financial guarantees disclosed in Note 2.25 have been provided as corporate guarantees to financial institutions and banks that have extended credits and other financial assistance to the Company's subsidiaries. In this regard, the Company does not foresee any significant credit risk exposure.

## c. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from a change in the price of a fi nancial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk-sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive fi nancial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

Foreign exchange risk

The Company's exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Roubles and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in U.S. dollars, Euros and Roubles). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's financial performance gets adversely impacted. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding derivative contracts are given in Note 2.35 above.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,511/(424) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 1,193/ (1,588) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2016.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,308/(631) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 1,460/ (1,604) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2015.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.36 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2016, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 27,730 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR minus 5 to plus 125 bps whereas as of 31 March 2015, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 26,366 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR minus 7.5 - 125 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary. An increase or decrease of 10% in the fl oating interest rate component applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by approximately ' 11 and ' 4 for the year ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015, respectively.

The Company's investments in fixed deposits with banks and short term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients.These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate signifi cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. The Company has historically not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

## 2.37 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

## 2.37.1 Gratuity Plan

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company provides for a lump sum payment to eligible employees, at retirement or termination of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund"). Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are primarily invested in Indian government bonds and corporate debt securities. A portion of the fund is also invested in Indian equities.

The following table set out the status of the aforesaid funded gratuity plan as required under AS-15 (Revised):

## ANNEXURE A TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended 31 March 2016, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Holding Company"), its subsidiary companies and jointly controlled entities, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Respective Board of Directors of the of the Holding Company and its subsidiary companies, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI"). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal fi nancial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal fi nancial controls, both applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over fi nancial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over fi nancial reporting.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fi nancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies and jointly controlled entities which are companies incorporated in India, have, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2016, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the ICAI.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## a) Basis of preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India ("Indian GAAP"). Indian GAAP comprises Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with Rule 7 of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, other pronouncements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Collectively referred to as "IGAAP"). The fi nancial statements are presented in Indian Rupees rounded off to the nearest million.

## b) Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IGAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the fi nancial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the year. Examples of such estimates include estimation of useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, valuation of inventories, assessment of recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets and cash generating units, provision for sales returns, rebates and chargebacks, provision for obligations relating to employees, provisions against litigations and contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

## c) Current and non current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the CompaniesGLYPH<nobreakspace>Act,GLYPH<nobreakspace>2013.

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets / liabilities include the current portion of non current assets / liabilities respectively. All other assets / liabilities are classified as non current.

## d) Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("DRL" or the "parent company"), and all of its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "the Company" or "the Group"), in which the parent company has more than one-half of the voting power of an enterprise or where the parent company controls the composition of the board of directors. In accordance with AS 27 - "Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures", the Company has accounted for its proportionate share of interest in joint venture by the proportionate consolidation method. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis:

- · The fi nancial statements of the parent company and the subsidiaries have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after eliminating intra-group balances / transactions and resulting unrealised profi ts in full. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group transactions have also been eliminated except to the extent that recoverable value of related assets is lower than their cost to the Company. The amounts shown in respect of reserves comprise the amount of the relevant reserves as per the balance sheet of the parent company and its share in the post-acquisition increase in the relevant reserves of the subsidiaries.
- · The proportionate share of Company's interest in Joint Ventures is combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after eliminating intra-group transactions and resulting unrealised profits, to the extent it pertains to the Company.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- · The excess / deficit of cost to the parent company of its investment in the subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates over its portion of equity at the respective dates on which investment in such entities were made is recognised in the financial statements as goodwill / capital reserve.
- · The consolidated financial statements are presented, to the extent possible, in the same format as that adopted by the parent company for its separate fi nancial statements.
- · The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.

## e) Tangible fi xed assets and depreciation

Tangible fi xed assets are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed assets includes non refundable taxes, duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the respective assets.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible fixed asset is capitalised only if it increases the future benefits from the existing assets beyond its previously assessed standards of performance.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the assets as estimated by the Company's management. Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of installation till the date the assets are sold or disposed.

Assets acquired on finance leases and lease hold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life whichever is shorter. Land is not depreciated.

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of fixed assets are given below:

|                                           | Years    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                 |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings    | 20 to 50 |
| - Ancillary structures                    | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and machinery                       | 3 to 15  |
| Electrical equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Laboratory equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to10   |
| Vehicles                                  | 4 to 5   |

Gains or losses from disposal of tangible fixed assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

Advances paid towards acquisition of tangible fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are shown under long-term loans and advances. Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on the balance sheet date, is shown as capital work-in-progress.

## f) Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of those fixed assets which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by the Company in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.

## g) Intangible assets and amortisation

Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition including any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing authorities), and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use.

Intangible assets are amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for its use.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of intangible assets are given below:

|                                                                    | Years   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Goodwill                                                           | 5 to 20 |
| Customer contracts                                                 | 2 to 11 |
| Copyrights and Patents (including marketing / distribution rights) | 3 to 16 |
| Technical know-how                                                 | 3 to 13 |
| Product related intangibles                                        | 5 to 15 |
| Others                                                             | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed at least at each financial year end. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from previous estimates, the amortisation period is changed accordingly.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal. Gains or losses arising from the disposal of intangible assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## h) Investments

Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as non current investments. Current investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value. The comparison of cost and fair value is done separately in respect of each individual investment.

Non current investments are carried at cost less any other-than-temporary diminution in value, determined separately for each individual investment. The reduction in the carrying amount is reversed when there is a rise in the value of the investment or if the reasons for the reduction no longer exist. Any reduction in the carrying amount and any reversal in such reductions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss.

## i) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). Cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchase, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. The cost of all categories of inventory is determined using weighted average cost method. NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

## j) Research and development

Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if:

- a. the product or the process is technically and commercially feasible;
- b. future economic benefits are probable and ascertainable;
- c. the Company intends to and has suffi cient resources, technical and financial, to complete development of the product and has the ability to use or sell the asset; and
- d. development costs can be measured reliably.

## k) Employee benefi ts

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The long term obligations are measured at present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations. Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

All actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Defined contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Compensated leave of absence

The Company provides for accumulation of compensated absences by certain categories of its employees. These employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof as per Company policy. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The measurement of such obligation is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Employee stock option schemes

In accordance with the SEBI guidelines, the cost calculated based on intrinsic value method i.e. the excess of the market price of shares, at the date prior to the day of grant of options under the Employee stock option schemes, over the exercise price is treated as employee compensation and amortised over the vesting period.

## l) Foreign currency transactions, balances and translation of financial statements of foreign operations

## Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the respective transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date are reported using the foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. The resultant exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non monetary assets and liabilities are carried at the rates prevailing on the date of transaction.

Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of the Company's net investment in a non integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve in the Company's financial statements. Such exchange differences are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the event of disposal of the net investment.

## Foreign operations

The fi nancial statements of the foreign integral subsidiaries, representative offi ces and branches collectively referred to as the 'foreign integral operations' are translated into Indian rupees as follows:

- · Items of income and expenditure are translated at the respective monthly average rates;
- · Monetary items are translated using the closing rate;
- · Non monetary items are translated using the monthly average rate which is expected to approximate the actual rate on the date of transaction; and
- · The net exchange difference resulting from the translation of items in the financial statements of foreign integral operations is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as foreign exchange gain/loss.
- In the circumstances where there are several exchange rates available within a country, or where the closing exchange rate does not refl ect the amount that is likely to be realized, then the relevant monetary items are translated using a rate that best represents the amount which is likely to be realized from, or required to disburse, such item at the balance sheet date.

The fi nancial statements of non integral foreign operations are translated into Indian rupees as follows:

- · All assets and liabilities, both monetary and non monetary, are translated using the closing rate;
- · Items of income and expenditure are translated at the respective monthly average rates; and
- · The resulting net exchange difference are recognized in foreign currency translation reserve account forming part of Company's reserves and surplus.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## m) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The premium or discount on foreign exchange forward contracts is amortized as income or expense over the life of the contract. The exchange difference is calculated and recorded in accordance with ASGLYPH<nobreakspace>11(revised), "The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" in the statement of profi t and loss. The changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts and swap contracts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as they arise. Fair value of such option contracts and swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques considering the terms of the contract.

Pursuant to the ICAI Announcement "Accounting for Derivatives" on the early adoption of AS 30 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement", the Company has adopted the Standard, to the extent that the adoption does not conflict with existing mandatory accounting standards and other authoritative pronouncements, the Companies Act, 2013 and other regulatory requirements.

## Cashfl ow hedges

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted tr ansactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified into the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, gets expired or is sold, terminated or exercised before the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, the hedge accounting on such transaction is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in hedging reserve continues to remain there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the balance in hedging reserve is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## n) Revenue recognition

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is reasonably certain, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances.

Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Accrual for chargeback, rebates, discounts and medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Accrual for such chargeback is made considering the factors such as historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers / other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Sales returns

The Company accounts for sales returns by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates.

## Profi t share revenues

From time to time the Company enters into various marketing arrangements with its business partners for the sale of its products. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profi t share which is over and above the agreed price. Revenue in an amount equal to the agreed price is recognized on these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. The additional amount representing the profit share component is recognized as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measure of the profit share is available.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognized over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognized as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive, or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

## Service Income

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognized in the statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Dividend and interest income

Dividend income is recognised when the unconditional right to receive the income is established. Income from interest on deposits, loans and interest bearing securities is recognised on a time proportion basis.

## Export incentives

Export incentives are recognised as reduction from cost of material consumed when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## o) Income tax expense

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit. Total tax expense is the aggregate of the amounts of tax expense appearing in the separate financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, tax expense is not adjusted for consolidation adjustments such as elimination of unrealized intra-group profi ts.

## Current tax

The current charge for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the relevant tax regulations applicable to the entities in the Company.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax charge or credit reflects the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period. The deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future; however, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is a virtual certainty of realisation of such assets.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are written-down or written-up to reflect the amount that is reasonably/virtually certain (as the case may be) to be realised.

## Minimum Alternate Tax

Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credit is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period. Such asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the carrying amount of the MAT credit asset is written down to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specifi ed period.

## Offsetting

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Company has a legally enforceable right to set-off assets against liabilities representing current tax, and where such deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## p) Earnings per share

The basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net profit after tax for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net profit after tax for the year and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the year, unless they have been issued at a later date. The diluted potential equity shares have been adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding shares).

## q) Impairment of assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (Cash Generating Unit or CGU) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its net selling price. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.

If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of amortised historical cost.

## r) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.

## Onerous contracts

A contract is considered as onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Company from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## s) Government grants

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction from the carrying amount of the related asset. Revenue Grants are deducted in reporting the related expense.

## t) Leases

At the inception of the lease, a lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an asset. A finance lease is recognized as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalized and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

## u) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment.

## (d) DPCO matters

The Company is contesting various demands for payment to the credit of the Drug Prices Equalisation Account under Drugs (Price Control) Order (DPCO), 1995 for few of its products, including norfloxacin. Based on its best estimate, the Company has made a provision for the potential liability related to the allegedly overcharged amount including the interest thereon and believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of penalty on this demand is not probable. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in its litigation in the Supreme Court, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and including penalties, if any, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (e) Nexium United States litigations

Five federal antitrust class action lawsuits were brought on behalf of direct purchasers of Nexium®, and ten federal class action lawsuits were brought under both state and federal law on behalf of end-payors of Nexium®. These actions were filed against various generic manufacturers, including the Company and its U.S. subsidiary Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. These actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The complaints alleged that AstraZeneca and the involved generic manufacturers settled patent litigation related to Nexium® capsules in ways that violated antitrust laws. The Company consistently maintained that its conduct complied with all applicable laws and that the complaints were without merit. In response to a motion for summary judgment made by the Company, the Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, fi nding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the Company's settlement of patent litigation with AstraZeneca included any large or unjustifi ed reverse payment, but preserving other claims for trial.

On 20 October 2014, the Company reached a settlement with all plaintiffs who had cases pending in the District of Massachusetts. The settlements with the class plaintiffs were subject to the Court's approval. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company made no payment to the class plaintiffs. The remaining defendants went to trial and prevailed, and that matter is on appeal.

The Court granted preliminary approval of the Company's settlements with the class plaintiffs on 28 January 2015, and granted fi nal approval of such settlements on 29 September 2015.

In addition, two complaints, similar in nature to those referenced above, were fi led in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by plaintiffs who chose to opt out of the class action lawsuit. No dispositive motions have been filed in these actions.

## (f) Reclast and Zometa United States litigation

In January 2013, Novartis AG ("Novartis") brought patent infringement actions against the Company and a number of other generic companies in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Novartis asserted that the Company's ANDA referencing Reclast® would infringe Novartis' U.S. Patent No. 8,052,987 and that the Company's ANDA referencing Zometa® would infringe Novartis' U.S. Patent No. 8,324,189. In February 2013, Novartis sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Company and the other defendants from launching generic equivalents to the Reclast® and Zometa® products. The Court denied Novartis' motion for a temporary restraining order on 1 March 2013 and, later that month, the Company launched its generic version of Novartis' Zometa® Injection (zoledronic acid, 4 mg/5mL product). The Company launched its generic version of Novartis' Reclast® Injection (zoledronic acid, 5 mg/100mL product) in April 2013.

In January 2016, the parties reached an agreement settling litigation regarding these products. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made a one-time payment to Novartis in exchange for a license to all relevant patents. The settlement ended the potential patent related liability associated with the Company's sale of these products.

Pursuant to this agreement, the Company paid ' 430 (USD 6.5 million) to Novartis as a settlement amount for past and future sales of the products. Of the total amount, ' 69 (USD 1.04 million) represents the payment for a non-exclusive license and is recognized as a product related intangible asset and the balance of ' 361 (USD 5.46 million) is recorded as "Other general expenses" in the Company's consolidated statement of profi t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2016.

## g) Child resistant packaging matter

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged in a letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company has violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the "CPSA") and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the "PPPA") and intends to seek civil penalties. Specifically, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certifi cates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC's allegations and is engaged in discussions with the CPSC regarding its compliance with the regulations.

Simultaneously, the Department of Justice (the "DOJ") had begun to investigate a sealed complaint which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") related to these same issues (the "FCA Complaint"). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers (the "Relators"), who are two former employees of the Company, have proceeded without the DOJ's and States' involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company's generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging. The Company disputes the allegations in the FCA Complaint and intends to vigorously defend against those allegations.

Although the DOJ and States have declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint filed by the Relators, the parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ, in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC related matter referred to the DOJ relates to 5 of the blister pack products. The Company cannot conclude that the likelihood of an unfavourable outcome is either probable or remote. Accordingly, no provision related to these investigations and claims is made in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2016. An unfavourable outcome in these matters could result in signifi cant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

## h) Namenda United States Litigations

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health & Welfare Fund ("Sergeants") filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the alzheimer's drug Namenda® (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009 until 2010. Sergeant seeks to represent a class of "end-payor" purchasers of Namenda® tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding Namenda® tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator's attempt to shift sales from the original immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product. The Company believes that the complaint lacks merit and that the Company's conduct complied with all applicable laws and regulations. All defendants, including the Company, have moved to dismiss the claims.

Four other class action complaints, each containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint, have also been filed in the Southern District of New York. However, two of those complaints were voluntarily dismissed, and the other two do not name the Company as a defendant.

In addition, the State of New York filed an antitrust case in the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set out in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

## i) Private Party Class Action Litigation on Pricing / Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015, a class action complaint was filed against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants (the "Action") in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In the Action, class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifically, plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets). The Company disputes these allegations and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

## (j) Land pollution, India

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land.The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Company believes that the possibility of additional liability is remote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company along with the alleged polluting industries have challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

## (k) Water pollution and air pollution, India

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along-with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board ("APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specified by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (l) Fuel surcharge adjustment

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded an amount of ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. As of 31 March 2016, the Company has made "payments under protest" of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

## (m) Assessable value of products supplied by a vendor to the Company.

During the year ended 31 March 2003, the Central Excise Authorities of India (the "Central Excise Authorities") issued a demand notice to a vendor of the Company regarding the assessable value of products supplied by this vendor to the Company. The Company has been named as a codefendant in this demand notice. The Central Excise Authorities demanded payment of ' 176 from the vendor, including penalties of ' 90. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 70 against the Company. During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 226 from the vendor, including a penalty of ' 51. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 7 against the Company. Furthermore, during the year ended 31 March 2006, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 34. The Company filed appeals against these notices with the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the "CESTAT"). In October 2006, the CESTAT passed an order in favor of the Company setting aside all of the above demand notices. In July 2007, the Central Excise Authorities appealed against CESTAT's order in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi.

On 27 November 2015, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the appeal of the Central Excise Authorities and passed an order in favor of the Company.

## (n) Distribution of input service tax credits

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various show cause notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each of such show cause notices and the consequential actions on and status of the same.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded                                        | Status                                                      |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| March 2008 to September 2009      | '  102 plus 100% penalties and interest  thereon       | The Company has filed an appeal before the CESTAT.          |
| October 2009 to March 2011        | '  125 plus penalties of  '  100 and interest  thereon | The Company has filed an appeal before the CESTAT.          |
| April 2011 to March 2012          | '  51 plus interest and penalties                      | The Company has filed an appeal before the CESTAT.          |
| April 2012 to March 2013          | '  54 plus interest and penalties                      | The Company has filed an appeal before the CESTAT.          |
| April 2013 to March 2014          | '  69 plus interest and penalties                      | The Company has filed an appeal before the CESTAT.          |
| April 2014 to March 2015          | '  108 plus interest and penalties                     | The Company is in the process of responding to such notice. |

The Company believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2016.

## o) Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company received various show cause notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such show cause notices and the consequential actions on and status of the same.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded        | Status                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| April 2006 to March 2009          | '  66 plus 10% penalty | The Company has fi led an appeal before the Sales Tax Appellate  Tribunal.                                                                                                              |
| April 2009 to March 2011          | '  59 plus 10% penalty | The Company has fi led an appeal before the Sales Tax Appellate  Tribunal.                                                                                                              |
| April 2011 to March 2013          | '  16 plus 10% penalty | The Appellate Deputy Commissioner issued an order partially in  favour of the Company. In January 2016, the Assistant Commissioner  issued an order partially in favour of the Company. |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 27 as of 31 March 2016, and believes that the possibility of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various show cause notices from the Indian Sales Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 57. The Company has responded to such show cause notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated financial statements as of 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>March 2016.

## (p) Direct taxes related matters

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Indian Income Tax authorities disallowed for tax purposes certain business transactions entered into by the parent company with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The associated tax impact is ' 570. The Company believes that such business transactions are allowed for tax deduction under Indian Income Tax laws and has accordingly filed an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Authorities. The Company further believes that the probability of succeeding in this matter is more likely than not and therefore no provision was made in respect of this matter in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2016.

Additionally, the Company is contesting various other disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 845. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavourable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and accordingly, no provision was made in respect of these matters in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2016.

During the years and 31 March 2014, 2015 and 2016, Industrias Quimicas Falcon de Mexico, S.A. de CV, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico, received a notice from Mexican Tax Authorities with respect to disallowance on account of transfer pricing adjustments pertaining to the calendar years ended on 31 December 2006, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The associated tax impact is ' 663 (MXN 172.5 million). The Company disagrees with the Authorities' allegations and filed an appeal with the SAT (Mexican Tax Administration Service). The Company believes that possibility of any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is not probabale and hence, no provision has been made in the consolidated fi nancial statements.

## 2.31 SEGMENT REPORTING

The primary and secondary reportable segments are business and geographic segments, respectively.

## Business segments:

The Company is organised on a worldwide basis into the following businesses which are reportable segments:

- · Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI");
- · Global Generics; and
- · Proprietary Products.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients: This segment includes active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as active pharmaceutical products or bulk drugs, which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. This segment also includes contract research services and the manufacture and sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients and steroids in accordance with the specific customer requirements.

Global Generics: This segment consists of finished pharmaceutical products ready for consumption/ use by the patient, marketed under a brand name (branded formulations) or as generic finished dosages with therapeutic equivalence to branded formulations (generics). This segment includes the operations of the Company's biologics business.

Proprietary Products: This segment consists of the Company's differentiated formulations business, New Chemical Entities ("NCEs") business, and the dermatology focused specialty business operated through Promius™ Pharma.

Others: This includes the operations of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited, a discovery stage biotechnology company developing novel and best-in-class therapies in the fields of oncology and inflammation and which works with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in early-stage collaborations, bringing drug candidates from hit generation through Investigational New Drug ("IND") fi ling.

## Geographic segments:

The Company's business is organised into five key geographic segments viz. India, North America, Russia and other CIS countries, Europe and Others. Revenues are attributable to individual geographic segments based on the location of the customer.

Segment revenues and expenses: All segment revenues and expenses are directly attributable to the segments.

Segment assets and liabilities: As certain assets of the Company including manufacturing facilities, development facilities, and treasury assets and liabilities are often deployed interchangeably across business segments, it is impractical to allocate these assets and liabilities to each business segment.

Inter-segment transfers: Segment revenue, segment expenses and segment result include transfers between business segments. Inter-segment transfers are accounted for at cost to the transferring segment. Such transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

Accounting policies: The accounting policies consistently used in the preparation of the financial statements are also applied to items of revenues and expenditure in individual segments.

Un-allocable and Head offi ce expenses: General administrative expenses, head-offi ce expenses, and other expenses that arise at the corporate level and relate to the Company as a whole, are shown as un-allocable items.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.32 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME (CONTINUED)

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at Annual General Meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>5 per option).

The fair market value of a share on each grant date falling under Category A above is defined as the average closing price (after adjustment of Bonus issue) for 30 days prior to the grant, in the stock exchange where there was highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after getting the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the issue of bonus shares by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock options granted in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |

In the case of termination of employment, all unvested options would stand cancelled. Options that have vested but have not been exercised can be exercised within the time prescribed under each option agreement by the Committee or if no time limit is prescribed, within three months of the date of employment termination, failing which they would stand cancelled.

The term of the DRL 2002 Plan was extended for a period of 10 years with effect from 29 January 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company under the DRL 2002 Plan has issued 102,224 Category B options to eligible employees. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

The date of grant, number of options granted, exercise price fixed by the Committee for respective options and the market price of the shares of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant are given below:

The Company instituted the DRL 2007GLYPH<nobreakspace>Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 27 JulyGLYPH<nobreakspace>2005. The DRL 2007 Plan came into effect on approval of the Board of Directors on 22 JanuaryGLYPH<nobreakspace>2007. The DRL 2007 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Under the DRL 2007 Plan, the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board ("the Committee") shall administer the DRL 2007 Plan and grant stock options to eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Committee shall determine the employees eligible for receiving the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of the grant. The options issued under the DRL 2007 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company under the DRL 2007 Plan has issued 40,184 Category B options to eligible employees. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

The date of grant, number of options granted, exercise price fixed by the Committee for respective options and the market price of the shares of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant is given below:

The Company has not granted any options under Category A of "the DRL 2007 Plan".

In addition to the above, during the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company adopted a new program to grant performance linked stock options to certain employees under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan. Under this program, performance targets are measured each year against pre-defi ned interim targets over the three year period ending on 31 March 2017 and eligible employees are granted stock options upon meeting such targets. The stock options so granted are ultimately vested with the employees who meet subsequent service vesting conditions which range from 1 to 4 years. After vesting, such stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years. The details of grants made under this program are included in the above tables under the respective plans.

Till 30 September 2015, the Company accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic method of accounting available under Securities and Exchange Board of India (Employee Stock Option Scheme and Employee Stock Purchase Scheme) Guidelines, 1999. Effective 1 October 2015, the Company applied Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefits) Regulations, 2014, which require the employee stock options to be accounted under the Guidance note on Accounting for Employee Share-based Payments issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). Consequent to such change, deferred employee stock compensation account has been de-recognised to confirm to the new accounting pronouncement.

The Company followed intrinsic method of accounting based on which a compensation expense of ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>455 (previous year: ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>519) was recognized in the statement of profit and loss. Had the Company used the fair value method, the compensation expense would have been ' 471. The differential stock compensation expense of ' 16 does not have any significant effect on the net results and EPS of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2016.

## Valuation of stock options under fair value method:

The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted under category B, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term, contractual term, as well as expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted under category A, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions refl ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

| Expected volatility     | 25.98%      |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| Exercise price          | '  5.00     |
| Option life             | 2.5 Years   |
| Risk-free interest rate | 7.87%       |
| Expected dividends      | 0.60%       |
| Grant date share price  | '  3,359.70 |

## 2.35.1 Gratuity Plan of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company provides for a lump sum payment to eligible employees, at retirement or termination of employment based on the last drawn salary and years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund"). Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are primarily invested in Indian government bonds and corporate debt securities. A portion of the fund is also invested in Indian equities.

The following table sets out the status of the aforesaid funded gratuity plan as required under AS-15 (Revised):

## 2.36 HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS, INTEREST RATE RISKS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

In respect of the aforesaid hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions, the Company has recorded, in reserves and surplus, a net gain of ' 972 and a net gain of ' 99 for the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.

## Trade receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. As at 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015 the maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables is ' 41,667 and ' 41,012 respectively (net of allowances).

## Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired

Trade receivables amounting to ' 35,284 and ' 33,473 were neither past due nor impaired as at 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2015, respectively.

## Trade receivables that are past due but not impaired

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The age analysis of the trade receivables has been considered from the due date of the invoice. The ageing of trade receivables that are past due, but not impaired, is given below:

| PERIOD (IN DAYS)   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2016   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2015   |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 0 - 90             | 5,160                  | 6,232                  |
| 91 - 180           | 577                    | 773                    |
| More than 180      | 738                    | 535                    |

## Trade receivables that are impaired

The age analysis of the trade receivables that are impaired is given below:

| PERIOD (IN DAYS)   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2016   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2015   |

## b. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2016 and 2015, the Company had unutilized credit limits from banks of ' 14,955 and ' 10,619, respectively.

As at 31 March 2016, the Company had working capital (i.e. current assets less current liabilities) of ' 49,833 including cash and bank balances of ' 18,358 and current investments of ' 21,122. As at 31 March 2015, the Company had working capital of ' 50,554 including cash and bank balances of ' 18,724 and current investments of ' 21,022.

## c. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from a change in the price of a fi nancial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk-sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive fi nancial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Roubles, Venezuelan bolivars and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in U.S. dollars, Euros and Roubles). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's financial performance may get adversely impacted. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding derivative contracts are given in Note 2.36 above.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease / increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,511 / (424) increase / (decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 1,274 / (1,712) increase / (decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2016. In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease / increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,308 / (631) increase / (decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 1,601 / (1,791) increase / (decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2015.

| Long term borrowings                | 19,701         | -      | 140       | -            | 19,841  |

| Other liabilities and provisions    | 7,809          | 191    | 1,598     | 870          | 10,468  |
| Total                               | 44,617         | 2,716  | 5,670     | 1,494        | 54,497  |

For the year ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, every 10% depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies in the above mentioned financial assets / liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by approximately ' 893 and ' 1,173, respectively, from such financial assets / liabilities.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2016, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 29,552 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR minus 5 to plus 125 bps whereas as of 31 March 2015, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 37,419 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 7.5 - 130 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

An increase or decrease of 10% in the fl oating interest rate component applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by approximately ' 12 and ' 6 for the years ended 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2016 and 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits with banks and short term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. The Company has historically not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

## 2.38 AGREEMENTWITH PIERRE FABRE

On 11 February 2014, Aurigene entered into a collaborative license, development and commercialization agreement with Pierre Fabre, the third largest French pharmaceutical company. This agreement granted Pierre Fabre global worldwide rights (excluding India) to a new immune checkpoint modulator, AUNP-12. AUNP-12 will be in development for numerous cancer indications.

Under the terms of this agreement, Aurigene received a non-refundable upfront payment from Pierre Fabre, which was deferred and recognized as revenue over the period in which Aurigene had continuing performance obligations.

During the three months ended 30 SeptemberGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015, Aurigene entered into another agreement with Pierre Fabre to transfer back to Aurigene the rights earlier out-licensed for the development and commercialization of AUNP-12. Consequent to such arrangement, Aurigene paid to Pierre Fabre a portion of the upfront consideration received and retained and recognized the remaining upfront consideration as revenue, as there are no pending performance obligations.

## 2.40 COLLABORATION AGREEMENTWITH CURIS, INC.

On 18 January 2015, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited ("Aurigene"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company, entered into a Collaboration, License and Option Agreement (the "Collaboration Agreement") with Curis, Inc. ("Curis") to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule antagonists for immuno-oncology and precision oncology targets.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene has the responsibility for conducting all discovery and preclinical activities, including Investigational New Drug ("IND") enabling studies and providing Phase 1 clinical trial supply, and Curis is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory and commercialization efforts worldwide, excluding India and Russia. The Collaboration Agreement provides that the parties will collaborate exclusively in immuno-oncology for an initial period of approximately two years, with the option for Curis to extend the broad immuno-oncology exclusivity.

As partial consideration for the collaboration, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 18 January 2015, Curis issued to Aurigene 17.1 million shares of its common stock, representing 19.9% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to the transaction (approximately 16.6% of its outstanding common stock immediately after the transaction). The shares issued to Aurigene are subject to a lock-up agreement until 18 January 2017, with the shares being released from such lock-up in 25% increments on each of 18 July 2015, 18 January 2016, 18 July 2016 and 18 January 2017, subject to acceleration of release of all the shares in connection with a change of control of Curis. During the year ended 31 March 2016, lock-up restrictions were released on 8.55 million shares of common stock, representing 50% of the shares which Aurigene received from Curis. In connection with the issuance of such shares, Curis and Aurigene entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated 18 January 2015 which provides for certain registration rights with respect to resale of the shares. The common stock of Curis is listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Global Market.

The cost of the shares of common stock on the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement was ' 1,452 (USD 23.5 million).

Revenues under the Collaboration Agreement consist of upfront consideration (including the shares of common stock) and the development and commercial milestone payments described below, which are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period for which Aurigene has continuing performance obligations.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene is entitled to development and commercial milestone payments as follows:

- · for the first two programs: up to USD 52.5 million per program, including USD 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any;
- · for the third and fourth programs: up to USD 50 million per program, including USD 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus prespecified approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any; and
- · for any program thereafter: up to USD 140.5 million per program, including USD 87.5 million in approval and commercial milestones, plus prespecified approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any.

In addition, Curis has agreed to pay Aurigene royalties, ranging between high single digits to 10%, on its net sales in territories where it commercializes products. Furthermore, Aurigene is entitled to receive a share of Curis' revenues from sublicenses, which share varies based upon specified factors such as the sublicensed territory, whether the sublicense revenue is royalty based or non-royalty based and, in some cases, the stage of the applicable molecule and product at the time the sublicense is granted.

## 2.41 VENEZUELA OPERATIONS

Dr. Reddy's Venezuela, C.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is primarily engaged in the import of pharmaceutical products from the parent company and other subsidiaries of the Company and the sale of such products in Venezuela. During the years ended 31 March 2016 and 2015, the Company's revenues from Venezuela were ' 4,666 (Venezuelan bolivar ("VEF") 457) and ' 8,335 (VEF 813) respectively.

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government launched an overhaul of the exchange rate system and introduced a new exchange rate mechanism. The Marginal Currency System (known as "SIMADI") is the third mechanism in the new three-tier exchange rate regime and allows for legal trading of the Venezuelan bolivar for foreign currency with fewer restrictions than other mechanisms in Venezuela (CENCOEX and SICAD).

The new second tier, SICAD, is a combination of the former second and third tiers, SICAD I and SICAD II, with an initial rate of approximately 12 VEF per USD 1.00. The first tier, the offi cial exchange rate, is unchanged and sells dollars at 6.3 VEF per USD 1.00 for preferential goods.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.41 VENEZUELA OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

Nine months ended 31 December 2015

For the nine months ended 31 December 2015, all the monetary assets and liabilities that were eligible for exchange at the CENCOEX preferential rate of 6.3 VEF per USD 1.00 and were pending for approval have been translated at such rate. The balance of the Company's Venezuelan monetary assets and liabilities, for the nine months ended 31 December 2015, which the Company believes, may not qualify for the CENCOEX preferential rate of 6.3 VEF per USD 1.00 have been translated using the SIMADI rate. Consequently, foreign exchange loss of ' 776 and ' 843 on translation of such monetary assets and liabilities at the SIMADI rate was recorded for the nine months ended 31 DecemberGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015 and the year ended 31 March 2015, respectively.

During the nine months ended 31 December 2015, the Company received approvals for only USD 4 million from the CENCOEX for remittance towards the importation of pharmaceutical products at the CENCOEX preferential rate.

## Update during the three months ended 31 March 2016

The economic conditions in Venezuela continued to deteriorate further during the three months ended 31 March 2016. In February 2016, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its foreign currency exchange mechanisms, including the devaluation of its offi cial exchange rate. The following changes became effective as of 10 MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2016:

- · The CENCOEX preferential rate was replaced with a new "DIPRO" rate. The DIPRO rate is only available for purchases and sales of essential items. Further, the preferential exchange rate was devalued from 6.3 VEF per USD 1.00 to 10 VEF per USD 1.00.
- · The SICAD exchange rate mechanism, which last auctioned USD for approximately 13 VEF per USD 1.00, was eliminated.
- · The SIMADI exchange rate mechanism was replaced with a new "DICOM" rate, which governs all transactions not subject to the DIPRO exchange rate and will fluctuate according to market supply and demand. As of 31 March 2016, the DICOM exchange rate was 272.5 VEF per USD 1.00.

The Company has not yet received approvals from the Venezuelan government to repatriate any amount at preferential rates beyond the USD 4 million already approved and received during the year ended 31 March 2016. The Company fully considered all the aforesaid developments, facts and circumstances and believes that it is appropriate to use the DICOM rate (i.e. 272.5 VEF per USD 1.00) for translating the monetary assets and liabilities of the Venezuelan subsidiary as at 31 March 2016.

Tabulated below is the impact of the foregoing on the financial statements of the Company:

| PARTICULARS                                                                                                                            | AMOUNT   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Foreign exchange loss on account of currency devaluation and translation of monetary assets and liabilities using  SIMADI / DICOM rate | 4,621    |
| Impact of inventory write down, impairment of fixed assets and reversal of export related benefi ts                                    | 464      |
| Total impact                                                                                                                           | 5,085    |

Including the foreign exchange loss of ' 843 recognized during the year ended 31 March 2015, the total loss recognized on account of operations in Venezuela was ' 5,928.

Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainity, the Comapny continues to actively engage with the Venezuelan Government and seek approval to repatriate funds at preferential rates.
