## 40 YEARS OF SERVING PATIENTS

For four decades, we have stood for advancing healthcare through access, affordability and innovation. Our work has been guided by our core tenets of deep science, progressive people practices and robust governance. 'Good Health Can't Wait' has become a movement and call to action for all of us, and good health encompasses people, planet and patients. We are grateful for the trust our patients and stakeholders have had in us throughout our journey.

As the pharmaceutical industry evolves, we will continue to work on strengthening our core further and building the future of healthcare as we aim to touch the lives of over 1.5 billion patients by 2030.

Our second Integrated Report combines our Annual Report and our Sustainability Report to present a holistic view of our Company and how we create value for patients and other stakeholders.

## Message from Chairman and Co-Chairman & MD

<!-- image -->

## Dear Shareholders,

FY2024 was an exciting and eventful year. We grew our core, invested in our future, and continued to serve our stakeholders. We also observed 40 years of our company's journey. Through this second edition of our integrated report, we bring you a brief overview of our journey, important highlights of the year, and the work we do for patients, people and planet.

## 40 Years of Creating Value

In February 2024, we marked our 40 th year of serving patients, with a legacy of access, affordability, innovation, and sustainability. Our company was founded in 1984 to enable patients to access life-saving medicines, and to use science and innovation to open new avenues to meet unmet medical needs. This pioneering spirit and quest for excellence drove us to achieve significant

industry-firsts such as investment in drug discovery in the 1990s, expansion into international markets and first-to-market launches in several countries, the first 180-day exclusivity granted to Indian pharma by the USFDA, listing on the NYSE, and adoption of voluntary disclosures and science-based commitments in sustainability.

Giving back to society was instilled into the ethos of the company from its early days.

We also learnt several lessons along the way from a myriad of challenges - from acquisitions that did not work well, to a period of Quality compliance issues, and several geo-political crises.

We are grateful that through all the thick and thin, we had constant support and trust from our patients, the medical fraternity, shareholders and investors,

<!-- image -->

customers, partners, and all other stakeholders. Our people are our pride, and nothing gives us more joy than to see our people realise their full potential in the company, and to see several of our alumni lead the industry forward.

There is still a long way to go. No company can afford to rest on its past laurels. The pharma landscape continues to evolve constantly and remains extremely competitive. Our approach is to ensure that we continue to do the basics well in our core businesses of API, generics, branded generics, biosimilars and OTC. On the other hand, as demographics, disease patterns, business models evolve, it is important to anticipate healthcare trends of the future. We have started investing in areas that we think could be future growth drivers - novel molecules (NCEs, NBEs, CAR-T), digital therapeutics (wearables, apps), and consumer healthcare (nutrition and OTC wellness). These are relatively new and long-gestation areas requiring companies to think and do things differently through strong partnerships, investment in newer capabilities, and an appetite for risk. In FY2024, we made good progress in some of these areas.

## Highlights of FY2024

Overall, we delivered strong financial results in FY2024. We had double digit revenue growth at 14%, reported EBITDA margin for the year at 29.7%, and ROCE of over 35%. Our growth and profitability were driven by our performance in the U.S.

Strategic collaborations played an important role in helping us introduce the latest generation of treatments to patients in India, both in our current core business as well as future growth drivers. We signed a partnership with Sanofi in India to take their well-established and trusted vaccines portfolio to more people all over India. With combined sales of over ' 426 crore (as per IQVIA MAT February 2024), the vaccine portfolio also propels us to the second position

among vaccine players in India. Our collaboration with Bayer in India, to market their second brand of the molecule Vericiguat, helps us make this new class of drugs in heart failure management available to patients in India, in and beyond metros in tier-I and tier-II towns. It also bolsters our heart failure management portfolio as we look to strengthen our play in the chronic segment. Our collaboration with Pharmazz Inc. enables us to market the first-in-class molecule Centhaquine in India, a potential add-on drug in the management of hypovolemic shock.

We continue to advance our work in the identified future growth spaces of access to novel molecules, digital therapeutics, and consumer healthcare. Our regulatory work in India on Toripalimab, for which we partnered with Junshi Biosciences, has moved forward. We have taken early steps in the area of digital therapeutics, with the launch of the drug-free migraine management device Nerivio®, and a digital integrated care plan to manage Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Consumer healthcare is a fast-growing segment. In recent years, we have acquired several well-known brands in the U.S. in Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT), pain-relief, and women's health. In India, we have a portfolio of OTC products in the hydration, cough-cold-allergy, and skin care categories. The recent announcement of a joint venture with Nestlé India to bring the well-known global range of nutritional health solutions as well as vitamin, minerals, herbals and supplements of Nestlé Health Science (NHSc) to India, is another significant move to strengthen our nutrition and OTC business in India. In Emerging Markets, we have a long-established and sizeable OTC business with market-leading products in the allergy, pain relief, gastro-intestinal and women's health categories. We also entered the UK consumer health market with the launch of the OTC allergy medication Histallay this year. A few days ago, we announced the acquisition of the global consumer healthcare brand Nicotinell and its various market-leading brand

names in over 30 countries outside of the U.S. We see this acquisition as an ideal anchor platform to grow our consumer healthcare business.

Through all of the above, our aim is to meet unmet needs of patients and to enhance standard of care wherever possible. We also continue our efforts to be viewed as the partner of choice for our commercial strengths and footprint, our governance, ESG and progressive practices, and our discipline.

While our people put in every effort to ensure we meet our business targets and ESG goals, there are always challenges along the way. Our record financial performance in the last two years has been led by a blockbuster product in the U.S. We are working hard to ensure that our current investments and diversified business model approach help us maintain sustained growth in the upcoming years. As part of the usual course of business, we faced several regulatory inspections at our manufacturing sites in FY2024. Our all-time readiness approach stood us in good stead but we continue our state of constant vigilance in Quality compliance. Our dossier for our proposed rituximab biosimilar candidate received a Complete Response Letter from the USFDA. We will continue to work closely with the USFDA to address and resolve all concerns within stipulated timelines in order to make this biosimilar rituximab available to patients in the U.S. as soon as possible. Similarly, the bold and ambitious nature of our ESG goals means that it is challenging to succeed equally in every goal every year.

However, our commitment remains undeterred. By the end of FY2024, we had served over 700 million patients and continue our endeavour to reach over 1.5 billion patients globally by 2030. Our progress was recognised in our ascent to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, improved position in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook, and Gold Medal status by EcoVadis. In FY2024, we also launched Womb to the World,

<!-- image -->

an initiative within our India business for working mothers from the pre-natal care stage to support in various ways until their children attain 18 years of age, thereby enabling more women to stay in the workforce and succeed in their careers. In partnership with Dr. Reddy's Foundation, we upgraded several primary healthcare centres in Srikakulam. We also completed a pond rejuvenation community project in Baddi, and funded a rare disease research centre at the Dr. Reddy's Institute of Life Sciences.

Over 40 years, our company has evolved from an API player to formulations, finished drugs, biosimilars, and newer healthcare segments. Amidst the evolution, what has remained unchanged is our endeavour to keep access, affordability, innovation at the heart of everything we do. And we continue to be guided by our core tenets of deep science, progressive people practices, and robust governance.

Once again, deep gratitude to all those who have supported and contributed to our journey of 40 years. It is an important milestone, but as our founder Dr. Anji Reddy often remarked, we would like to build an organisation that will last 500 years.

## The three Strategic Pillars are

<!-- image -->

## SUSTAINABILITY

## Leadership in Chosen Spaces

We are driven by our purpose of accelerating access to affordable and innovative medicines because Good Health Can't Wait. We strive to increase product launches which are first to market, develop complex and differentiated products, enhance access to innovative products and deepen our market presence through new 'go to market' channels.

These actions enable us to gain and maintain leadership position in several therapies and products categories in the markets in which we operate.

Our products and services are spread across Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API), prescription generics, biosimilars and over-thecounter pharmaceutical products. Our major therapeutic focus areas

<!-- image -->

Patient-Centric Product Innovation

are gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, diabetology, oncology, pain management and dermatology. We offer value proposition for our customers through cost leadership, backward integration, reliable customer service and robust compliance track record.

<!-- image -->

## Our Chosen Spaces - Our Core Business

## Global Generics

Through our branded and unbranded drug products, we aim to offer affordable alternatives to highly-priced innovator brands, both directly and through partnerships. Our major markets are USA, India, Russia & CIS countries, China, Brazil, South Africa, and Europe.

<!-- image -->

## Branded Generics

We seek to have a portfolio of credible brands, first-to-market products and deliver differentiated products to doctors and patients. Many of our brands hold significant market shares in the molecule and therapy areas where they are present.

## Unbranded Generics

We aim to ensure that our development capabilities remain robust, enabling us to deliver products that are first-to-market, cost competitive, challenging to manufacture, and technologically advanced.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI")

The PSAI segment is comprised of the API business and the pharmaceutical services business.

<!-- image -->

## API Business

We strive to bring complex products and enable launches ahead of others at competitive prices.

## Pharmaceutical Services Business

We offer niche capabilities and technology platforms at competitive cost structures to innovator and biotechnology companies.

<!-- image -->

We are also investing in the following areas to drive future growth:

## Access to Novel Molecules

We are collaborating with multiple innovator companies to bring their innovative products to India and other emerging markets which will increase access of these products. We are investing in building capabilities for CAR-T in India with support of our licensing partners. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Aurigene Oncology Limited (AOL), is engaged in discovery and early clinical development of novel, best-in-class therapies to treat cancer and inflammatory diseases.

## Consumer Health

We are expanding our consumer health portfolio to serve a greater number of patients directly. While Russia, certain CIS countries and India already have an established consumer health business, we are now strengthening our presence in markets such as US and the UK. Additionally, we are establishing our presence in the direct business channel through e-commerce for select markets.

## Digital Health Solutions

Digital healthcare spans a wide spectrum of solutions, including digital therapeutic products offering drug-free treatment and disease management platforms that enable patients to better manage their condition. We have launched a digital therapeutics product Nerivio, for migraine management and a digital platform DailyBloom, for IBS condition management. We believe this is an evolving space that will help to address unmet patient needs in the coming years.

In FY2024, we were the 8 th largest generic company in US by sales. Our market rank as per IQVIA, was 11 th in India and 15 th in Russia for this period. We have also increased our market share in multiple products and gained rank in a few therapies across markets.

## Biosimilars

Our endeavour is to improve access to biosimilar products globally through a combination of collaborations and clinical research. Having launched multiple biosimilar products in India and other emerging markets, we have also taken this business into highly regulated markets.

<!-- image -->

## Operational Excellence and Continuous Improvement

Our aim is to significantly reduce non-value-added work, minimise breakdowns, incidents, elevate skills to optimise productivity and asset utilisation. This will enable error-free operations, accelerate product launches, improve cost competitiveness, and enhance responsiveness to customer needs - all the while optimising resource utilisation. This approach will lead to efficiency, innovation, and sustained growth.

## Patient-centric Product Innovation

We strive to bring innovative products to address the unmet needs of our patients. We do this by developing differentiated products and launching generic versions of innovative products ahead of others. We are investing in new technologies and capabilities such as CAR-T. We have a healthy pipeline of products spread across small molecules and biosimilars.

## Digital Operations

Over the last 3 years, the OpsNext program, known as the Digital Lighthouse, has implemented over 30 Industry 4.0 initiatives that have been powered by advanced analytics, digital twins, robotic process automation, augmented/virtual/mixed reality, digital performance management, and the industrial internet of things (IIoT). The culmination of these efforts has resulted in the recognition of the FTO 3 plant as a Digital Lighthouse by the World Economic Forum, making it a part of the prestigious Global

We continuously seek to add value through incremental innovation in our existing products, keeping the need of patients in mind. We are applying Machine Learning and AI to run large number of experiments for higher speed and lower cost to development.

We continually cultivate partnerships, engage with academic experts and

## Primary Healthcare Services (PHCs)

We are working to improve the quality of primary healthcare services in selected primary health care centres. The PHCs are being upgraded in partnership with the District Administration and District Medical & Health Office, with an objective to provide a fully functional facility with basic and modern medical amenities to the local communities. The project thus focusses on strengthening the existing health machinery and takes a unique approach of making the healthcare facility approachable not only in terms of the services but also in terms of the quality of infrastructure, encouraging people to visit the PHCs, and thereby creating demand. This effort has resulted in easy access and availability of affordable healthcare services within the community

'' We live in a tribal area where home births are customary. However, after Dr. Greeshma explained the care and safety provided at the Primary Health Centre (PHC) during childbirth, I decided to deliver my baby there. The PHC was very clean, with new chairs and beds, resembling a private hospital. The nurses were compassionate and ensured a comfortable childbirth experience. My child and I received very good care and all necessary treatments and medicines free of charge. I now encourage pregnant women in my neighbourhood to consider the PHC for their deliveries.''

- - R. Bhagya (Meliaputti, Andhra Pradesh)

'' Working as a daily wage labourer, I can't have food on time and thus have severe gastric problems. Working under sun for long hours with gastric pain was agonising. Medicines were very expensive and I was not able to provide enough money to my family.

But now at (upgraded) PHC, I receive doctor consultations and all medicines without paying any money. I'm taking medicines regularly and trying to follow healthy diet suggested by the doctor.''

## Testimonial from Youth Skilling

''I worked at a local company and when my company decided to close the contract, I had no money as I couldn't save anything from my small salary. To go to Bangalore and find a stable job, I didn't know how to apply and pass the interview. My father is a farmer, so I had to find a good job to support myself and my family.

While I was searching for jobs online, I saw a post about GROW. I visited the centre and received good counselling about my skill gaps, and potential companies after training. I learned soft skills and interview skills and cleared interviews at One Point One Solutions. The skills I learned in training are very valuable at work and I also was rewarded with 'The Best Employee Award' recently.''

(Aspirant, Youth Skilling)

## Testimonial from Sashakt

''I'm pursuing an M.Sc. in Chemistry at IISc. Studying here has always been a dream. The atoms, molecules, interaction between them and complexities intrigue me.

The faculty provides a great mentorship, and I am excited to start my research in Organic Electronics soon. I'm from a small village in Uttar Pradesh and Sashakt Scholarship helped me realise my dream of pursuing a career in Chemistry.

Science exists in everything around us, and it is everevolving. There is always something new to discover in it. My goal is to contribute to the discovery, that can help society, even in the smallest possible way.''

## Testimonial on Agroforestry

'' People go to work in a factory nearby. We don't find labourers for sowing or harvesting. When I paid more money to get labourers, I couldn't save any money for my children.

I started cultivating coconut because it requires little maintenance. The first yield takes 5 to 6 years, so I started working as a farm labourer. I used to earn about ' 9,000. I struggled to run a household and maintain a coconut farm with the income I earned.

After attending community meetings of (Dr.) Reddy's Foundation, I started Agroforestry. I planted fruit trees alongside the coconut trees. I'm earning an extra ' 3,000 a month by selling fruits.''

- - Mandala Ramakrishna (Srikakulam, A. P.)

My goal is to contribute to the discovery, that can help the society, even in the smallest possible way.

Goal

Progress

## Transitioning to Renewable Power

Our strategy to achieve 100% renewable power by 2030 includes maximising the capacity utilisation factor (CUF) of renewable power supplies by developing new wind & solar hybrid projects through joint venture partners for long-term supply, and switching from fossil fuels to biomass in boilers and co-generation plants and securing long-term supplies through various measures. We are developing alternate biomass fuel sources like rice husk and sawdust briquette, ensuring strategic forward contracts with biomass fuel suppliers to address supply chain issues, and adapting to the latest green technologies. We will continue to invest in solar, hydel, and wind power projects and accelerate our journey of green transition by substantially increasing the share of renewable energy at all our facilities. We are driving energy management, conservation, and efficiency projects to enable us to achieve our energy goals.

Energy Performance

Increasing energy efficiency

## Energy Transition

Shifting to low-carbon fuels as well as usage of biomass in place of fossil fuels

From the above three levers, we have implemented 96 ideas to save 14 mn kWh and 11,737 steam tonnes which reduced around 11,500 tonnes of CO$\_{2}$ emissions in FY2024. This is further supported by the lever of improving energy mix, that is generating and purchasing power through renewable sources. We may use carbon offsetting at later stages for neutralising our residual emissions.

## Working on Emissions in the Value Chain (Scope 3)

## Other Emissions

74% of our carbon footprint emerges out of the external value chain. 12 out of the 15 Scope 3 emission categories defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol are applicable for our operations. Based on the GHG Scope 3 methodology guidance, Categories 1 and 10 - purchased goods and services, and processing of sold products are the largest contributors to our overall Scope 3 emissions. We are working on multiple levers including enhanced engagement with strategic suppliers, developing sustainable procurement strategy, and a preference for local suppliers and materials wherever feasible.

As part of our efforts to reduce Scope 3 carbon footprint, we are increasingly transitioning from air to sea transport, improving packaging to optimise shipments, and increasing renewable power as well as biofuels.

We engaged with high value spend suppliers to understand supplier specific performance related to emissions and water, and are expanding our coverage further. We have shifted our Scope 3 accounting model from overall spend based to supplier-specific spend based method, which has also contributed to a reduction in our Scope 3 emissions.

<!-- image -->

Industrial processes generate significant amounts of SO$\_{2}$ & NOx emissions as well as particulate matter that adversely affect local ecosystems, air quality, and habitats. We are committed to preventing and mitigating air pollution by increasing the efficiency of operations and reducing emissions. We adhere to emission norms and control emissions within statutory limits. We adhere to all relevant environmental laws, regulations, and guidelines in the markets where we operate. We have no pending action for environmental non-compliances in the reporting year.

## Water Stewardship

Committed to water stewardship, we prioritise sustainability in our water supply system. Water, a shared resource, is vital for our operations, shaping our responsibility beyond our boundaries. High-quality water is essential for production, sourced from various channels like surface, ground and municipal. We optimise freshwater usage by enhancing efficiency, and mitigate groundwater risks via initiatives like maximising surface water utilisation and other alternate water source. Since achieving water-positive status in FY2023, we continued our efforts to maintain the status in FY2024, ensuring a sustainable water future. Water Positivity Status is verified by M/s. TUV SUD South Asia Pvt Ltd.

- Cat 1 - Purchased goods and services
- Cat 4 - Upstream transportation and distribution
- Cat 10 - Processing of sold products
- Cat 3 - Fuel-and-energy-related-activities (not included in Scope 1 or 2)
- Other remaining categories

<!-- image -->

The key levers which drive the water positivity in the organisation include:

## Water Efficiency Improvement

In FY2024, conserved 95,344 KL of water via various initiatives from water pinch analysis, operational excellence ideas generated and cross replication projects across our manufacturing operations.

## Alternative Sources of Water

Reduced fresh water footprint by 35,261 KL, via treated grey water from communities. Also, 30% of ground water reduction potential identified via utilisation of surface water and desalinated water to de-risk our dependency on ground water.

## Rainwater Harvesting (beyond the fence community projects)

- y 3 ponds rejuvenated in FY2024 (1 in Miryalaguda and 2 in Sathiwada)
- y 31,805 m 3 volume of desilted across 3 ponds which resulted in 155,949 KL of water recharge

## Sustainable Agriculture Through Alternate Wetting & Drying (AWD) Technique

In FY2024, through this initiative reached out to 1,787 farmers in 70 villages, covering 2,844 acres of land in Srikakulam and Vizianagaram district, Andhra Pradesh contributed in 18.5 lakhs KL of water savings.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## Recycle and Reuse of Treated Water

Deployment of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) technology in our operations resulted in reuse of recycled water, which is 48% of the fresh water withdrawal.

## Rainwater Harvesting

Through catch the Rain 2.0 initiative

Freshwater intake reduced per annum

## 102,582 KL

## Waste Management

We have efficient waste management practices and ensure proper treatment and disposal of all waste type. Our plastic waste undergoes recycling or co-processing, while e-waste is sold to authorised vendors. The hazardous waste is sent to cement industries and recyclers for co-processing and recycling, with only ~1% sent to landfill. The non-hazardous waste like glass, MS scrap, wood waste, and boiler ash is routed to recyclers, brick manufacturers, and cement industries for co-processing. We have continuous improvement projects targeting waste reduction for both hazardous and non-hazardous waste categories.

## Green Chemistry

By adopting green chemistry technologies, we reduce our environmental footprint and improve sustainability, reduce costs and improve efficiency. By improving the Process Mass Intensity (PMI), we increase the yield improvement, solvent recovery, catalyst recovery, and reduce the hazardous waste generation in our processes. In FY2024, we evaluated 26 products through chemistry gate clearance. Through the implementation of 17 cost improvement projects leveraging green chemistry principles,

we have successfully reduced nearly 22% hazardous waste generation in the manufacturing of those products.

<!-- image -->

To read more about our chemistry efforts, please refer to our ESG supplementary data book.

## Green Building

We are adopting principles of green factory buildings to maintain better resource efficiency in our premises. We have 7 sites of the Company certified as green buildings under IGBC. Our formulations plant FTO 2 is awarded IGBC Platinum award and FTO 11 is 'first-in-the-country' injectable manufacturing site to achieve Platinum IGBC Green Factory Building Certificate for Oncology Project, which is the second consecutive Platinum award at this site.

## Protecting Biodiversity

During the reporting period, we published our biodiversity policy. The objective of the policy is to conserve and enhance biodiversity at

<!-- image -->

all our locations, and guides our work on biodiversity internally.

In September 2023, at the World Economic Forum (WEF) - Sustainable Development Impact Meetings (SDIM) 2023, we have taken a pledge to conserve, restore and grow forests, contributing to 1t.org's restoration efforts. The integrated plantation initiative will cover 2,900 hectares over a period of 5 years from 2023 to 2028. This would encompass mangrove, agroforestry, and bund plantations, offering a comprehensive approach that benefits both nature and the climate. By nurturing biodiversity, capturing carbon, enhancing ecosystem resilience, and promoting economic stability, the project aligns with multiple ecological goals while also addressing economic needs and promoting community well-being. During the year, we have done plantation on 680 hectares and this initiative is being implemented through Dr. Reddy's Foundation, our non-profit implementing partner.

## Product Responsibility Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)

This year, we completed LCA studies for three API products - Clopidogrel, Metoprolol and Fexofenadine by an independent agency. The assessment was done for entire product lifecycle and emissions were included from raw material production (cradle) to the gate (until the stage at which the product is ready for use before it is transported). These studies were carried out based on ISO 14044:2006 guidelines.

## LCA offers the following benefits:

- y Determining the overall environmental impact associated
- y Identifying potential hotspots, i.e., the major environmental impact contributor(s)
- y Informed decision-making (priority setting, determining alternatives, design improvements, planning and strategising, etc.)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- y Comparing alternatives to determine the more sustainable choice in material selection

## Sustainable Packaging

Our Sustainable Packaging Council (SPC) focusses on reducing our environmental impact through redesigned packaging. To improve the sustainability of our products, we reduced the amount of packaging used including reducing the number of layers and the overall mass of packaging. We introduced recycled content where possible and ensured that all tertiary packaging materials used were recyclable or reusable.

<!-- image -->

To read more about the key initiatives we have undertaken for the year, please refer to our ESG supplementary data book.

## Sustainable Technologies

We are working with various agencies in adopting new technologies across the value chain for continuous improvement in environmental parameters such as water, wastewater, waste, and emissions. This includes replication of low temperature evaporator in place of Multi Effect Evaporator across all the ZLDs, upgrading biological system with Membrane bio reactors, closed circuit reverse osmosis replacing conventional RO which consumes 60% less energy, usage of HHO gas in boilers to improve fuel combustion efficiency, Scope 1 emission reduction and lowering boiler fuel consumption, digitalisation of ETP in alignment with Industry 4.0 etc.

Business Units and Risk Champions

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function focusses on identifying key business, operational, and strategic risks through quarterly assurance meetings, structured interviews, on-call discussions, and incident reviews. Risks are categorised into risk groups and aggregated at different levels of the organisation. Our ERM function operates with the objective of proactively identifying and increasing awareness about various risks among the appropriate stakeholders, facilitating discussions on prioritising and mitigating identified risks, developing systems to alert when risk tolerance

limit appetite are exceeded, establishing a framework to assess risk tolerance appetite and analysing remaining risks. The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) oversees our compliance processes including Third Party Risk Management for ABAC compliances, while the Chief Internal Auditor helps to enhance and protect organisational value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice, and insight. The Chief Risk Officer (CRO) leads the risk function.

We engage in discussions with relevant internal stakeholders to analyse insights learned from risk incidents that have

occurred either within the organisation or in the external environment.

These insights are then integrated into our policies, procedures, and processes as deemed appropriate. We also have a third-party risk management to assess cybersecurity risk when selecting and onboarding third parties like external IT partners and suppliers.

The Audit Committee and Science, Technology and Operations Committee also review the risks identified by the internal auditor or otherwise.

## Global Pharmaceutical Market Outlook 1

The global pharmaceutical market was estimated at around US$ 1.6 tn in CY2023, a US$ 100 bn more than CY2022. In the post pandemic era, pharmaceutical companies have been refreshing their portfolio strategies to continue their growth trajectory, with a combination of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), investments in research and development (R&D), including novel therapies and a higher adoption of digital capabilities. Most of these companies continue to be resilient in the face of increasing competition, the ever-evolving regulatory landscape, pricing and reimbursement pressures, looming patent expirations and growing demands from patients and health care providers for more effective medications and experiences. Recent trends observed in the sector are articulated below.

According to a recent report by IQVIA on use of medicines, the global medicine market is expected to grow more than

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

US$ 600 bn to reach a size of around US$ 2.3 tn by CY2028 - indicating a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5%-8%. Availability of innovative therapeutics in developed markets, offset by losses of exclusivity and the lower costs of generics and biosimilars will drive this growth.

## Losses of exclusivity (LOE) provide growth opportunities for Generics and Biosimilars

## Across the top 10 developed markets, the impact of brand losses of exclusivity between CY2024 and CY2028 is expected to double to around US$ 192 bn versus

versus US$ 81 bn in the previous five years (See Figure 1). 30% of this is on account of availability of biosimilars. Global biotech spending is set to exceed US$ 890 bn by CY2028, with growth slowing to 9.5%-12.5% due to the impact of biosimilars. The LOE events will provide opportunities for generic and biosimilar players to grow, and also reduce healthcare spends for the patient.

The outlook and the key trends discussed in this section are primarily from 'The Global Use of Medicines 2024' and 'Global Trends in R&D 2024' by IQVIA Institute, '2023 Global Life Sciences Outlook' by Deloitte, 'World Preview 2023' by Evaluate Pharma and from various other publicly available sources.

<!-- image -->

## Collaborations on Novel Therapies driving growth in medicine use and spends

Pharmaceutical companies are further focussing on innovation and collaboration for creating value. After the post-pandemic pullback in CY2022, biopharma's R&D spending is set to return to growth, albeit at a moderate rate of acceleration (See Figure 2). As per another recent report by IQVIA on R&D trends, large pharma companies spent a record total of US$ 161 bn in R&D in CY2023, an increase of almost 50% since 2018. An average of 65-75 new innovator brand launches per year in the top 10 developed markets are expected over the next five years.

<!-- image -->

Pharmaceutical companies are looking to augment their traditional drug portfolios with R&D in next-generation therapies. While they are keen to invest in platforms like cell and gene therapy, messenger RNA (mRNA), biologics, antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), they increasingly realise they cannot do it alone. Hence, they are more willing than before to collaborate with other stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem to share knowledge, expertise, and resources.

## Oncology and Immunology continue to be leading Therapy Areas

Oncology and immunology are expected to grow, respectively, at 14%-17% and 2%-5% CAGR through CY2028, respectively. Oncology is projected to add 100 new treatments over the next five years. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist drugs have seen an uptake since the approvals for obesity indications in the United States (U.S.) in CY2021 and are expected to accelerate further, if insurers and governments support reimbursement. New therapies in Alzheimer's and anxiety/depression are expected to drive growth in neurology and mental health spending. Next-generation bio-therapeutics, including cell, gene, and RNA therapies, are expected to grow threefold in the next five years, with an addition of 50 new therapies.

## Technology to bring in efficiencies in R&D and Supply Chain

Companies are expected to build on advances in big data analytics as well as digital innovations to improve R&D efficiencies and enhance the patient outcomes and experiences. With the pandemic accelerating virtual trials, R&D can be transformed from drug discovery and development to regulatory approval through real-world evidence (RWE), new approaches to clinical trials and partnerships, and AI.

Likewise, the volatility of the pandemic and geopolitical concerns affecting logistics as well as the complexity of next-generation treatments such as personalised cell and gene therapies have compelled pharmaceutical companies to streamline their manufacturing processes, make their supply chains agile and sustainable, and enhance real-time tracking through advanced digital systems. To enable this, pharmaceutical companies are now integrating technology with business through the use of AI, Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, etc.

<!-- image -->

## Taking Patient-Centricity beyond the Pill

Companies are expanding their patient-centric approaches beyond drug and medical device manufacturing to create a digital ecosystem, with the intent of better understanding patient experience and needs. Prescription-based digital therapeutics, decentralised diagnostics and virtual clinical trials using wearable devices are creating an interoperable ecosystem, contributing to patient-centricity.

Preventive health solutions and use of digital tools have the potential to be transformative in the way that healthcare is delivered and managed.

## Increasing need for Responsible Leadership

Pharmaceutical companies can make a significant difference with their approaches towards their people, patient and planet. Improving clinical trial diversity, tailoring products specifications to diverse needs (e.g. multilingual packaging) and improving access to affordable, quality medication and innovative solutions can help reduce health equities. Companies need to continue to be mindful of the environmental impacts of their operations including their supply chains as well as antimicrobial resistance issues. Last but not the least, responsible leadership extends to the inclusiveness of their people practices as well as the culture of integrity and high standard of business ethics. Sustainability can provide opportunities for market differentiation, operational efficiency, talent retention, access to new revenue streams, and improved financial performance and can create value for the organisation.

## Dr. Reddy's Performance Update, FY2024

FY2024 has been a year of good momentum. We reported highest ever sales, and delivered attractive financial returns, while continuing to invest in pipeline opportunities and advancing our innovation agenda through partnerships and collaborations. We also made progress on our three innovation-led future growth levers of consumer healthcare, novel molecules and digital therapeutics.

<!-- image -->

## Consolidated revenues in FY2024 was ' 279.2 bn , a

growth of 14% compared to the previous year. This was driven by increase in base business volumes, new product launches across our businesses, and the benefit of foreign exchange rate gains. It was partially offset by price erosion in our global generics segment markets in North America and Europe as well as the divestment of some of our non-core brands from India in the previous year.

## Global Generics

Revenue from GG in FY2024 was ' 245.5 bn , a growth of 15% versus the previous year. This was driven by strong performances witnessed in North America, Europe, and Emerging Markets.

In FY2024, GG contributed to around 88% of our Company's overall sales. Some key highlights of the segment for the year were:

- y Partnered with Shanghai Junshi Biosciences for the development and commercialisation of the anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, Toripalimab, in 21 countries
- y Entered an exclusive development and commercialisation deal with U.S.-based Coya Therapeutics for their product COYA 302, an investigational combination biologic for treatment of the neuro-degenerative disease, ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease)
- y A total of 181 products were launched across geographies in FY2024
- y A total of 241 global filings were done in FY2024

## ' 245.5 bn

Revenue from Global Generics

## North America Generics (NAG)

In FY2024, our largest market, NAG, contributed to around 53% of our Company's GG sales and 47% of overall sales. Revenue from the region for FY2024 was ' 129.9 bn or approximately US$ 1.6 bn, representing an impressive growth of 28% over the previous year. The growth was largely on account of increased volumes in the base business, including Lenalidomide as well as revenues from new products launched in FY2024. The US generic prescription product portfolio which was acquired from Mayne Pharma last year was successfully integrated this year. Growth was further aided by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Indian rupee.

## Some key highlights of the segment for the year were:

- y Forayed into the OTC wellness space in the U.S. with the relaunch of Premama ® , an acquired portfolio of dietary supplements
- y Acquired a leading women's health and dietary supplements portfolio, MenoLabs ®
- y Collaborated with Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company, aimed at increasing access to essential medications for Wilson disease patients
- y Entered into an in-licensing agreement with Tenshi Kaizen for launch of Loratadine for private label OTC business
- y Launched 20 new products, including Treprostinil Injection, Regadenoson Injection in the U.S. as well as products acquired from Mayne Pharma
- y Filed 17 new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA)
- y Cumulative ANDA filings as of March 31, 2024 is 325
- y As of March 31, 2024, we had 86 generic filings pending approval from the USFDA. These comprise 81 ANDAs and five New Drug Applications (NDAs) filed under the Section 505(b)(2) route of the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Of the 86 ANDAs, 50 are Paragraph IV applications, and we believe that 24 of these have the 'First to File' status

Over the last 25 years, our biosimilars business has developed into a fully integrated organisation, with capabilities across development, manufacture and commercialisation of a range of biosimilar products in oncology and immunology. Our current portfolio comprises six commercial products marketed in India, with some products marketed in more than 25 other countries. One of our products, Pegfilgrastim, has been commercialised in the U.S. and in Europe through our partner. In addition, we have a pipeline of products in oncology and auto-immune diseases, in various stages of development for global launches, including a biosimilar Abatacept candidate as well as a biosimilar Rituximab candidate. The USFDA completed a Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI) at our biologics manufacturing facility in Bachupally for our proposed Rituximab biosimilar candidate, after which we received a Form 483 with nine observations. In April 2024, the USFDA has issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) to our Biologics License Application (BLA). The CRL is in reference to ongoing resolution of the afore-mentioned observations, as well as certain aspects pertaining to the BLA. We are currently working on addressing these within stipulated timelines. We expect approval from the USFDA in the next fiscal. We are also ramping up manufacturing capacity to support our global expansion plans.

Revenue from Emerging Markets for FY2024 was ' 48.6 bn, an increase of 7% as compared to the previous year. The growth was driven by new launches as well as market share expansion, which more than offset the impact of unfavourable forex. In FY2024, Emerging Markets contributed to 20% of our global generics sales and 17% of our overall sales. We launched a total of 106 new products across various countries within the segment this year.

## ' 48.6 bn

Revenue from Emerging Markets

Revenue from Russia for FY2024 was ' 22.3 bn, representing an increase of 5% over the previous year. However, in local currency (Russian Rouble) terms, there was an increase of 16% over the previous year. This growth was largely attributable to higher sales prices and volumes. IQVIA ranked us 15th in terms of sales in Russia for the twelve months ended March 31, 2024, and we continue to outperform the market growth in terms of volumes in Russia during the same period.

Revenue from CIS countries and Romania for FY2024 was ' 8.6 bn, which remained broadly flat as compared to the previous year. The benefit of higher sales prices was offset by decreases in sales volumes.

Revenue from our Rest of the World markets (which includes Brazil, China, South Africa, Australia, and certain other markets) for FY2024 was ' 17.7 bn, representing an increase of 13% over the previous year. The increase is largely attributable to new products launched during the year as well as increase in sales volumes in Brazil, South Africa and Colombia partially offset by price erosion.

Our medium-term strategy for the segment is to build a healthy portfolio pipeline, including oncology products, coupled with the expansion of biosimilars. We are also focussed on growing 'Mega Brands' both in prescription and OTC segments. We will further scale up in our major markets, which include Russia, China, Brazil, and South Africa and add new geographies by leveraging our in-house global portfolio of generics and biosimilars and seeking in-licensing opportunities. In the longer term, our focus would be to build a differentiated portfolio including nutritional solutions, biologics, NCEs/NBEs as well as offerings like Disease management & Direct-to-Customer.

## India

Revenue from India in FY2024 was ' 46.4 bn, a decline of 5% compared to the previous year. In FY2024, India contributed to 19% of our global generics sales and 17% of our overall sales. This decline in revenues was largely due to the divestment of a few non-core brands in the previous year, offset by revenues from new product launches and higher sales prices. Excluding divestment income from base business; India market grew in mid-single digit for the year. We continued to strategically collaborate to further strengthen our position in the Indian Pharmaceutical Market (IPM) as well as to progress on the future growth levers of consumer healthcare, novel molecules, and digital therapeutics. As of March 31, 2024, we had a total of 391 branded products in India and a field force of over 8,600 sales representatives to detail our product portfolio. According to IQVIA in its report for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2024, our secondary sales grew by 7.3%. Our market rank was 10th as per Moving quarterly total (MQT) March 2024 and 11th as per Moving Annual Total (MAT) in terms of sales value. Some key highlights of the segment during the year were:

## Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI)

The PSAI business recorded revenues of ' 29.8 bn in FY2024, an increase of 3% compared to the previous year. In FY2024, PSAI contributed to 11% of our overall sales. This increase was largely on account of new products launched during the year and benefits from favourable currency rate fluctuations, partially offset by lower sales volumes and price erosion. In FY2024, we filed 133 drug master files (DMFs) globally , of which 11 were in the U.S. Cumulatively, our total active DMFs filed worldwide as of March 31, 2024 were 1,861, including 251 active DMFs filed in the U.S.

<!-- image -->

The PSAI segment primarily consists of our business of manufacturing and marketing active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and intermediates, which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. APIs become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption, such as a tablet, capsule, or liquid, using additional inactive ingredients. We also serve our customers with incremental value-added products, including semi-finished and finished formulations. This year, we entered into an agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to develop injectable contraception drug for low and middle-income countries in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, including India. This initiative will strengthen our portfolio in the women healthcare space.

Our PSAI segment also includes our pharmaceutical services business, under the entity, Aurigene Pharmaceutical Services Limited. Our objective is to be the preferred partner for innovator pharmaceutical companies, providing a complete range of services that are necessary to support their innovations to bring a new drug to the market quickly and efficiently.

## Outlook

Our strategy of building a sustainable and growing business involves new product launches and the ramping up of base businesses in key geographies, while driving economies of scale and assurance of supply through backward integration. We will continue to leverage our relationships with key customers by supplying materials that have value addition instead of being 'plain vanilla' APIs. We aim to be a partner of choice for global pharmaceutical companies and achieve global leadership through costs and service.

## Others

## Revenues

Total revenues grew by 14% to ' 279,164 mn in FY2024. This was driven by increase in base business volumes, new product launches across our businesses, and the benefit from foreign exchange rate gains. It was partially offset by price erosion in our GG segment markets of NAG and Europe as well as the divestment of some of our non-core brands from India in the previous year.

## Gross Profit

Gross profit increased by 17% to ' 163,607 mn in FY2024. This led to a gross profit margin of 58.6% in FY2024, representing an increase of 193 basis points compared to the previous year. The gross profit margin for GG was 62.9%. This increase was on account of favourable product mix, higher government incentive, productivity cost savings, partially offset by price erosion in select markets like U.S. and Europe and brand divestment income during previous period. For the PSAI business, the gross profit margin was 23.2%. The improvement in gross margin is on account of leverage in overall manufacturing overheads due to higher sales, favourable forex and higher government benefits.

## Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses

SG&A expenses increased by 14% to ' 77,201 mn in FY2024. The increase is largely on account of higher investments in sales and marketing activities to strengthen our existing brands, new business initiatives including scaling up OTC and consumer health and wellness business, digitalisation initiatives and building strong commercial capabilities. SG&A accounted for 27.7% of sales in FY2024 in line with last year.

## Research and Development (R&D) expenses

R&D expenses for FY2024 were ' 22,873 mn, or 8.2% of revenue, versus 7.9% in FY2023. The YoY increase by 18% is primarily on account of increase in number of filings and our developmental efforts to build a healthy pipeline of complex products across our markets for both small molecules and biosimilars.

We are committed to building, safeguarding and strengthening our research skills and stimulating innovative thinking throughout our organisation, which allows us to pursue operational excellence and value creation.

## Impairment of Non-Current Assets

In FY2024, there has been a charge of ' 3 mn on impairment of non-current assets, in comparison to ' 699 mn in the previous year. The charge in the previous year was related to the medical cannabis-based business acquired from

<!-- image -->

Nimbus Health GmbH and an impairment of the Company's product-related intangibles due to adverse market conditions.

## Net Other Operating Income

In FY2024, Net Other Operating Income was ' 4,199 mn, versus ' 5,907 mn in the previous year. The net other income was lower for FY2024, primarily on account of higher net other income recognised in the previous year from a settlement agreement with Indivior Inc., Indivior UK Limited, and Aquestive Therapeutics Inc. as well as gain on sale of other intangible assets.

## Net Finance Income

Net Finance Income was ' 3,994 mn in FY2024, versus ' 2,853 mn in FY2023. The increase was largely on account of higher profits from sale of investments, partially offset by lower gain on currency exchange rate fluctuations.

## Net Profit

Net Profit increased by 24% to ' 55,684 mn in FY2024, versus ' 45,067 mn in the previous year. This represents a PAT margin of 19.9% of revenues versus 18.3% in FY2024. The effective tax rate was lower for full fiscal FY2024 mainly due to adoption of corporate tax rate under section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act of India.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

The data is given in Tables 3 and 4 . Net Cash generated from operating activities in FY2024 was ' 45,433 mn. Investing activities net outflow amounting to ' 40,283 mn in FY2024 includes net investment in property, plant, equipment, and intangibles to build capacity and capabilities for future business growth. Cash outflow from financing activities during the fiscal was ' 3,763 mn. Closing cash and cash equivalents on March 31, 2024, was ' 7,107 mn.

## EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION

## OVERVIEW AND PHILOSOPHY

Our executive compensation programme supports attracting, motivating, and encouraging continuity of relevant leaders who advance our critical business objectives and promote the creation of shareholders' value over the long-term. The key tenets are:

- a) Attract highly talented individuals from within and across industries drawing from a diverse pool of global talent.
- b) Provide long term and short-term incentives that advance the interests of shareholders and deliver levels of pay commensurate with performance.

<!-- image -->

## APPROACH TO PAY BENCHMARKING

The three principal components of the compensation package include, base salary, annual cash-based variable pay, and equity-based long-term incentives. In making decisions with respect to each element of compensation, the competitive market for executives and compensation levels of the comparable companies are considered.

Pay practices at companies with which Dr. Reddy's competes for talent, including those engaged in similar activities are reviewed from time to time. Our approach is to be market aware and not market driven . We believe that information regarding pay practices at other companies is useful to assess the reasonableness and competitiveness of our own.

We generally target executive pay to be within range of 75 th percentile of pay packages for executives in similar positions, responsibilities and/or experience in similar companies of comparable size.

We identify certain roles that are fungible across multiple industries where our comparative pool is not limited to peer generic pharmaceutical organisations. In such cases - a wider sample is selected comprising of non-pharma marquee organisations operating in the country with whom Dr. Reddy's competes for talent.

## REVIEW AND INCREMENTS

Executive compensation is reviewed annually. Executive increment percentages approach is lesser than the Company average, while the frontline receiving the highest increase. A higher increase may be made in the event of a role change, promotion. The Company's performance, affordability, individual performance and compensation history are other considerations, while deciding on compensation.

## EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

Our executive directors' compensation comprises of a fixed monthly component and a profit based annual commission based on standalone net profits of the Company. The total remuneration to be paid to the executive directors is within the limits prescribed under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013.

While recommending such a commission, the NGCC also takes into account the overall corporate performance in a given year and the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The considerations include but are not limited to: Financial metrics covering growth in return on capital employed (RoCE) and profitability, non-financial metrics covering aspects such as health, brand building, compliance, quality and sustainability of operations of the organisation, as may be agreed upon from time to time with the Company.

Perquisites and retirement benefits are paid in accordance with the Company's compensation policies, as applicable to all employees. The Company, in compliance with Section 197 of the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations, does not grant any stock options to the Executive Directors. No severance fee is payable to them.

In terms of the approval given by the members of the Company, each of the Executive Directors was entitled to get 0.75% of the net profits of the Company, i.e. ' 43.97 cr each. However, the Board, on the recommendation of the NGCC approved a fair commission for the Executive Directors, i.e. ' 9 cr and ' 16 cr for Mr. K Satish Reddy and Mr. G V Prasad, respectively.

## CEO COMPENSATION

Our CEO compensation comprises of guaranteed cash, short term incentives in the form of variable pay, long-term incentives, retirals, and perquisites. 75% of our CEO pay is at risk and linked with the Company's performance in terms of balanced scorecard achievement against plan and Company stock performance.

Short Term incentives are tied to the Company performance against the balanced scorecard and individual performance of the CEO as determined by the Board of Directors.

In FY2024, Mr. Erez Israeli, Chief Executive Officer, has received an increment of 2.4% on fixed compensation. His fixed salary was ' 6.27 cr, with a target variable pay of 100%, and long term incentives of value ' 13.77 cr vesting at the end of 3 years.

## PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT

Our current performance management follows a balanced scorecard approach comprising of current business performance, future business performance, ESG, digital, people, compliance and safety related metrics.

The Board of Directors uses a stringent process to set ambitious financial targets in line with the strategy of the Company. In addition to the financial targets, the scorecard also has ambitious strategic objectives across key priority areas, including targets related to ESG matters. The scorecard is proposed by management council to the Board of Directors for approval before the start of the financial year.

Each parameter is devised into a metric, financial or otherwise and is measured quarterly. Non-financial parameters have a cap of 100% achievement while financial parameters are scored based on a predetermined grid.

<!-- image -->

Additional considerations such as wind-falls, impairments and one-offs are measured separately.

Our performance management process is specifically adapted to different employee cohorts based on their specific needs, the overall principles remain the same across all the models.

Performance evaluation of Management Council ("MC") member's focuses on achievement of their Business Unit Scorecard. Individual MC evaluation focusses on achievement of

- a) The BU (Business Unit) scorecard for the year that contributes to the delivery of the overall Company's strategy.
- b) Demonstration of desired leadership behaviours and aligned to the overall Company values

Balanced scorecard performance is measured in constant currencies to reflect operational performance that can be influenced.

## COMPANY PERFORMANCE FOR FY2024

In FY2024, we achieved robust financial performance. Our revenue grew by 14%, with EBITDA margins reaching 29.7% for the year. Additionally, our ROCE exceeded 36%. These impressive results were primarily fueled by our strong performance in USA. Our record financial performance in the last two years has been led by a blockbuster product in the U.S. We are working hard to ensure that our current investments and diversified business model approach help us maintain sustained growth in the upcoming years.

In our identified future growth spaces of access to novel molecules, digital therapeutics, and consumer healthcare, once again strategic partnerships have been important. We have taken early steps in the area of digital therapeutics, starting with the launch of the drug-free migraine management device Nerivio® in partnership with Theranica. Our all-time readiness approach stood us in good stead but we continue our state of constant vigilance in Quality compliance.

We also continue our efforts to be viewed as the partner of choice for our commercial strengths and footprint, our governance, ESG and progressive practices, and our discipline. While our people put in every effort to ensure we meet our business targets and ESG goals, there are always challenges along the way.

## MALUS AND CLAWBACK

Any performance linked compensation paid to Management Committee members is subject to malus and clawback rules. This means that the NGCC may decide - subject to applicable law - to retain any unpaid or unvested incentive compensation (malus), or to recover incentive compensation that has been paid or vested in the past (clawback).

The Company has a full-fledged R&D division continuously engaged in research on new products and process improvement on existing products as part of continuous improvement in and outside India. As a part of technology absorption and adoption, once technology is developed for a product, it is tested in a pilot plant and thereafter commercial production is performed. Innovation is embarked by an incremental approach towards cost, time, quality and complex product development by adopting cutting edge technology and our philosophy is to continuously upgrade the technology.

AI in R&D: At R&D, we are examining the entire value chain and selecting critical use cases that have a significant impact on unlocking value. This value is manifested through timely product launches achieved by leveraging data science and digital technologies. We are harnessing the power of digital in API (active pharmaceutical ingredients) by generating pre-determined synthetic routes, in formulations by employing advanced in vitro-in vivo correlation studies, leveraging our data and laboratory resources, and incorporating machine learning techniques

Advance Characterisation Capability: Advance Analytical Characterisation capability has been established using hyphenated analytical equipment's to study various physicochemical properties of drug substance and drug product, de-formulating the reference product that aid in bringing the drug much faster to the market.

Green Chemistry: We developed in-house capability to develop and implement the set of green chemistry principles and practices that aim to design chemical processes and products that minimise the use and generation of hazardous substances. By adopting green chemistry technologies, we could reduce our environmental footprint and improve sustainability, while also potentially reducing costs and improving efficiency.

Adoption of technology and robust scientific principles led to successful development of complex generic products at the desired cost with improved quality. With advanced capabilities in-house; scientific understanding of the products was enhanced ensuring a swifter on-time regulatory approval and a more efficient overall system

## 2. Does the entity have processes in place to avoid/manage conflict of interests involving members of the Board? (Yes/No) If yes, provide details of the same

Yes. The Company has a Conflict of Interest Policy which lays down the principles and standards that govern the actions of the Company including its subsidiaries, joint ventures and its directors, officers and employees (full time or part time, contract employees and consultants). This Policy provides guidance for recognising, reporting and resolution of any actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest.

Further, as part of the Governance ecosystem, the Company has adopted best practices on reviews of conflict of interest of Directors. In case any director is getting appointed or associated with any new organisation, such director makes proactive disclosure of his association with the new organisation to the Chairman and the Company Secretary. The said disclosure is placed before the next meeting of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee (NGCC) for reviewing the conflict or potential conflict of situation of such director, if any, with the Company after being associated with new organisation. The Director's disclosures are also placed before the Board and conflict of interest, if any, are discussed and reviewed by the Board. The Board collectively is responsible for decision-making on conflict of interest disclosed to the Board for any business decisions, wherein any of the Directors are interested.

## Describe the processes in place to safely reclaim your products for reusing, recycling and disposing at the end of life, for

- (a) Plastics (including packaging)
- (b) E-waste
- (c) Hazardous waste
- (d) Other waste

We have waste management systems in place at all our facilities. Plastic waste is either co-processed or recycled based upon the type of waste generated. E-waste is sold to authorised vendors. 99% of our global hazardous waste is sent to cement industries and recyclers for

co-processing and recycling. The remaining 1% of global hazardous waste is sent to landfill.

Other non-hazardous waste such as glass, MS scrap, wood waste, and boiler ash, etc. are sent to recyclers, cement industries for co-processing or to brick manufacturers.

We also monitor the waste management in further value chain wherein all our expired products are incinerated at authorised destruction vendor.

Other waste like plastic drums/pallets etc. used for transportation are sold out to scrap vendors who are known for either re-use/recycle.

Yes, we work in compliance with India's Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 (subsequent abatements) and the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) guidelines. Our waste collection plan is in line with the EPR plan submitted to Pollution Control Board (PCB). During the year FY2024, we have fulfilled the target by recycling and end of life as per the EPR requirements.

Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases

Dr. Reddy's policy on Ombudsperson as well as non-retaliation supports the Company values and "Speak Up" culture by taking proactive steps to ensure that employees who raise concerns in good faith are protected and supported in the workplace, as appropriate. To protect the interest of complainant, we follow a strict non-retaliation policy, where any retaliation against an employee who in good faith raises concerns or who assists in an investigation of suspected wrongdoing, is not tolerated. Non-retaliation policy is applicable to all employees (including, but not limited to, all current and past employees, contract workers, part-time or temporary workforce) and third parties of the Company. A concern of potential retaliation can be raised through multiple reporting channels that are available and promoted across the organisation.

## 10. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by the Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes

We have waste management systems in place at all our facilities. Plastic waste is either co-processed or recycled based upon the type of waste generated. E-waste is sold to authorised vendors. 99% of our global hazardous waste is sent to cement industries and recyclers for co-processing and recycling. The remaining 1% of global hazardous waste is sent to landfill.

Other non-hazardous waste such as glass, MS scrap, wood waste, boiler ash etc. is sent to recyclers, cement industries for co-processing or to brick manufacturers.

We reduce waste through technological interventions and ongoing initiatives including sustainable packaging, waste source segregation, process optimisation etc.

Accordingly, there are continuous efforts to strengthen our data resiliency.

- 6. Disclose any significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard

There is no significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain partners. 100% of our critical and strategic suppliers have valid air, water & waste consent.

However, we also measure our Scope 3 emissions to address the emission hotspots in the value chain. To address the reduction in carbon footprint, we have driven major projects around:

-  Air to sea shipment
-  Truck Loadability: With appropriate planning and management, we have optimised the utilisation of trucks resulting in a reduction of trips and overall carbon footprint
-  We encourage dedicated transporters to shift to low carbon fuels
-  We drive supplier engagement programmes to help them opt for projects resulting in reduction of Carbon footprint

Moreover, independent directors cannot retire by rotation. Further, Regulation 25(2A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, provides that, appointment, re-appointment or removal of an Independent Director of a listed entity, shall be subject to the approval of shareholders by way of a special resolution.

During FY2024, the members of the Company approved the appointment/ re-appointment of the following Independent Directors of the Company in terms of Section 149 of the Act and applicable provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations:

- · Appointment of Dr. Claudio Albrecht (DIN: 10109819) for a consecutive term of 5 (five) years with effect from May 10, 2023, at the Annual General Meeting ("AGM") held on July 27, 2023;

## BOARD PROCEDURE

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the Board is the responsibility of the NGCC of the Board, which consists entirely of Independent Directors. Given the existing composition of the Board, the tenure as well as the years left of the existing members to serve on the Board, and the need for new domain expertise, the NGCC evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board

<!-- image -->

as well as description of the role and capabilities required of a Director on the Board. When such a need becomes apparent, the NGCC reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to give sufficient time to the Board responsibilities of the Company. It then places the details of shortlisted candidates to the Board for its consideration. If the Board approves, the person is appointed as an Additional Director. Thereafter, the approval of members is sought in terms of the provisions of the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations.

## INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

The Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations, inter alia , define an 'Independent Director' as a person who, including his/ her relatives, is or was not a promoter or employee or key managerial personnel of the company or its subsidiaries. Further, the person and his/ her relatives should not have a material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the company or its subsidiaries, during the three immediate preceding financial years or during the current financial year, apart from receiving remuneration as an Independent Director. There are various other conditions prescribed for Independent Directors under the said provisions.

We abide by these definitions of independent director, in addition to the definitions of an independent director as laid down in the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) listed company manual and other provisions by virtue of listing of Company's American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on the NYSE in the US. the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and US securities laws.

Based on the disclosures received from all Independent Directors, the Board has formed an opinion that the Independent Directors fulfill the conditions specified in the Act, the SEBI Listing Regulations, applicable provisions of NYSE listing manual, and are independent of the Management.

As on March 31, 2024, the Company has 9 (nine) Non-Executive Independent Directors (including 4 Women Independent Directors) which comprise 82% of the total strength of the Board of Directors. The Women Directors constitute 36% of the total strength of the Board of Directors. The maximum tenure of the Independent Directors is in accordance with the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations. The NGCC identifies candidates based on the identified laid down criteria and takes into consideration the need for diversity on the Board which, inter alia , includes skills, knowledge, gender and experience and accordingly, makes its recommendations to the Board.

## MEETINGS OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

Schedule IV of the Act and Regulation 25 of the SEBI Listing Regulations mandate that the Independent Directors of the Company shall hold at least one meeting in a year, without the attendance of non-Independent Directors and members of the Management. To exercise free and fair judgment in all matters related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, it is important for the Independent Directors to have meetings without the presence of the executive management.

During FY2024, our Independent Directors met 4 (four) times in sessions without the presence of Executive Directors and other members of Management. The Company is ready to facilitate more such sessions as and when required by the Independent Directors. During these meetings, the Independent Directors reviewed the performance of the Company and of the Chairman, Co-Chairman and Managing Director, its Senior Management and the Board. Corporate strategy, risks, competition, succession planning for the Board and Senior Management and the quality of information given to the Board were also discussed.

## COBE AND VIGIL MECHANISM

The Company has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ('COBE' or the 'Code'), which applies to all Directors and employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates. It is the responsibility of all Directors and employees to familiarize themselves with this Code and comply with its standards. The Directors and the Senior Management Personnel of the Company annually affirm compliance with the Code. A declaration of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to this effect is enclosed as Exhibit 7 to this chapter.

The Company has an Ombudsperson Policy (Whistle-Blower or Vigil Mechanism) to report concerns on actual or suspected violations of the Code. The Audit Committee Chairperson is the Chief Ombudsperson. Concerns raised to the Company and their resolution are reported through the Chief Ombudsperson to the Audit Committee and where applicable, to the Board. During FY2024, no personnel has been denied access to the Audit Committee on ombudsperson issues.

The COBE and Ombudsperson Policy are available on the Company's website: https://www.drreddys.com/ investors/governance/code-of-business-conduct-and-ethicscobe/#governance#code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics and https://www.drreddys.com/cms/cms/sites/default/files/2021-12/ Ombudsperson.pdf

## RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We have adequate procedures to identify and monitor related party transactions. All transactions with related parties are placed before the Audit Committee for review and approval. The related party transactions are also placed before the Board for review and noting/ approval, as appropriate. Transactions entered into with related parties during the financial year were on arm's length pricing basis and in the ordinary course of business. The details of related party transactions are discussed in note 2.24 to the standalone financial statements.

It also reviews the investments made by such subsidiaries, the statement of all significant transactions and arrangements entered into by subsidiaries and the compliances of each materially significant subsidiary on a periodic basis. The Audit Committee also reviews the utilization of loans/ advances/ investments given by the Company to its subsidiaries. The minutes of board meetings of the subsidiary companies are placed before the board for review.

## INTERNAL CONTROLS

We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:

- · Organization's strategic objective;
- · Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
- · Adequacy of safeguards for assets;
- · Reliability of financial and non-financial reporting; and
- · Compliance with applicable laws and regulations

The integrity and reliability of our internal control systems are achieved through clear policies and procedures, process automation, training and development of employees and an organization structure that segregates responsibilities.

Our internal audit team is an independent assurance and advisory function, responsible for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. The internal audit team helps to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice, and insight. The internal audit team prepares annual audit plans based on risk assessment and conducts extensive reviews covering financial, operational and compliance controls. Areas requiring specialized knowledge are reviewed in partnership with external experts or by recruiting resources with specialized skills. Suggested improvements in processes are identified during reviews and communicated to the management on an ongoing basis.

The Audit Committee of the Board monitors the performance of the internal audit team on a periodic basis through review of audit plans, audit findings and speed of issue resolution through follow ups. Each year, there are at least four meetings in which the Audit Committee reviews internal audit findings. During the year, the Audit Committee Chairman also met the Chief Internal Auditor without the presence of management.

## SIMPLIFICATION OF PROCEDURE AND STANDARDIZATION OF FORMATS OF DOCUMENTS FOR TRANSMISSION OF SECURITIES AND ISSUE OF DUPLICATE SHARE CERTIFICATES

SEBI vide its Circular dated May 18, 2022, as amended, as an on-going measure to enhance ease of dealing in securities markets and with a view to make the transmission process more efficient and investor friendly, has simplified the procedure for transmission of securities.

Further, SEBI vide its Circular dated May 25, 2022, with a view to make issuance of duplicate securities more efficient and investor friendly, has laid down operational guidelines for processing investor's service request for the purpose of issuance of duplicate securities and notified the documents required to be submitted by security holder while requesting for issuance of duplicate securities.

The claimants are requested to follow the procedures and formats, as stated in the above circulars, for making any application for transmission or duplicate issue of shares.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 46 of the Act, read with Rule 6(2)(a) of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, duplicate share certificates, in lieu of those that are lost or destroyed, should only be issued with the prior consent of the Board.

## DISCLOSURE ON LEGAL PROCEEDINGS PERTAINING TO SHARES

There are two pending cases relating to disputes over title of the shares of the Company, in which the Company has been made a party. However, these cases are not material in nature.

## NATIONAL ELECTRONIC CLEARING SERVICE (NECS) FACILITY FOR REMITTANCE OF DIVIDEND ELECTRONICALLY

The Company provides the facility for remittance of dividend to shareholders through NECS. Under this facility, shareholders can receive dividend electronically by way of direct credit to their bank account. With this service, problems such as loss of dividend warrants during postal transit/fraudulent encashment are avoided. This also expedites the credit of dividend directly to the shareholder's account as compared to the payment through physical dividend warrant. Shareholders are advised to refer to the Investor Handbook on the Company's website, www.drreddys. com , for further details on this facility.

## TRANSFER TO INVESTOR EDUCATION AND PROTECTION FUND (IEPF)

## UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS

Shareholders who have not claimed the dividend(s) amount are, therefore, requested to do so before they are statutorily transferred to the IEPF. Table 13 gives the transfer dates in this regard.

The shareholders who have not cashed their dividend are requested to immediately approach Company's RTA, for making payment through electronic bank transfer. In cases, where bank details for making electronic payment are not available, or electronic payment instructions have failed or rejected by the bank, duplicate warrant(s)/demand draft(s) may be issued in lieu of the original warrant(s)/ demand draft(s).

The information on unclaimed dividend/interest is available on the Company's website: www.drreddys.com .

This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management and board of directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.

<!-- image -->

- · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Annexure 2

## TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company") as of March 31, 2024 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI"). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls

with reference to these standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to these Standalone Financial Statements

A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Standalone Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or

fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria

established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

## 1.2 Basis of preparation of standalone financial statements

## a) Statement of compliance

These standalone financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024 comply in all material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, and as amended from time to time.

These standalone financial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective at the Company's annual reporting date, March 31, 2024. These standalone financial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on May 07, 2024.

## b) Basis of measurement

These standalone financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention, except for the following material items in the balance

sheet which are measured on the basis stated below and in accordance with the respective accounting policies:

- · derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;
- · financial assets and financial liabilities are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the classification based on accounting policy;
- · long-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method;
- · equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value on the grant date and the reporting date, respectively;
- · assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date; and
- · Contingent consideration arising out of business combination are measured at fair value.

## c) Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of standalone financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates implies that actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the standalone financial statements is included in the following notes:

- · Note 1.3 (b) - Assessment of functional currency;
- · Note 1.3 (c) - Financial instruments;
- · Note 1.3 (d) - Business combinations and goodwill;
- · Notes 1.3 (e) and 1.3 (f) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- · Note 1.3 (h) - Valuation of inventories;
- · Note 1.3 (i) - Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;
- · Note 1.3 (l) - Provisions and other accruals;
- · Note 1.3 (m) -Measurement of transaction price in a revenue transaction (sales returns and rebates);
- · Note 1.3 (p) - Evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets, estimation of income tax payable and income tax expense in relation to uncertain tax positions; and
- · Note 1.3 (l) - Contingencies

## d) Current and non-current classification

The Company segregates assets and liabilities into current and non-current categories for presentation in the balance sheet after considering its normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in Ind AS 1, "Presentation of Financial Statements". For this purpose, current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realization in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified period up to twelve months as its operating cycle.

## 1.3 Material accounting policies information:

- a) New standards, interpretations and amendments adopted by the Company effective from 01 April 2023:

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards

<!-- image -->

under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.

On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 01, 2023, as below:

Disclosure of Accounting Policies Amendments to Ind AS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements

The amendments to Ind AS 1 aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their 'significant' accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their 'material' accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

The company adopted amendments to Ind AS 1 effective as of 1 April 2023. The amendments did not result in any changes in the accounting policies themselves, nor they had any impact on recognition, measurement or presentation of any items in these financial statements. However, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the Company's standalone financial statements.

Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12

The amendments to Ind AS 12 "Income Taxes" narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases and decommissioning liabilities.

The Company previously recognized deferred tax on leases, resulting in a similar outcome as apply under the amendments, except that the deferred tax asset or liability was recognized on a net basis. Following the amendments, the Company has recognized a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-to-use assets as at 1 April 2022 and thereafter. However, there was no impact from

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

such change on the standalone financial statements as the balances qualify for offset under paragraph 74 of Ind AS 12. The key impact for the Company relates to disclosure of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized.

## Definition of Accounting estimates -

Amendments to Ind AS 8

The amendments to Ind AS 8 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting estimates and errors" introduce a new definition of 'accounting estimates' and clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. They also clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. These amendments had no impact in the standalone financial statements.

## b) Foreign currency

Functional and presentation currency These standalone financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the Company. All financial information presented, except information related to share and per share data, in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at exchange rates prevailing on the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous standalone financial statements are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- · certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value in OCI and;
- · qualifying cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are effective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash flows had occurred at the measurement date.

## c) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables generally do not contain any significant financing component requiring separation and are therefore recognized initially at the transaction price determined as per Ind AS 115, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in two categories:

- · Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- · Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

<!-- image -->

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in standalone statement of Profit and Loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election upon initial recognition on an instrument-byinstrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the standalone statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment.

<!-- image -->

However, on sale the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture: Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., April 1, 2015.

## Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

- · the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
- · Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables and other financial assets, if any, representing a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset. All equity investments and debt investments designated as FVTPL are not subject to impairment assessment.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition and measurement of impairment loss allowance on the contract asset and trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVTPL,

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL primarily comprise derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company and not designated as hedging instruments in a hedging relationship as defined by Ind AS 109.

Gains or losses on such financial liabilities are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

The Company has not designated any financial liability as FVTPL.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method and, thereby, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss over the period of the borrowings.

The effective interest rate amortisation is included under the head finance costs in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

<!-- image -->

## De-recognition

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Gain or loss arising on de-recognition, measured as difference between, the carrying amount of financial liability and the settlement amount, is recognized under the head finance costs in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

## Derivative financial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, South African rands, Romanian new leus, Australian dollars and Euros.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classified as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve as a component of equity. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the hedging reserve and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. In all other cases, the amount so accumulated is re-classified to the standalone statement of Profit and Loss and presented as part of the hedged item in the same period in which the forecasted transaction impacts the standalone statement of Profit and Loss. The ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges is

<!-- image -->

recorded in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as finance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to such relationships. Re-measurement gains or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities are recorded in the same manner as stated above for derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in OCI is recognized immediately in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the standalone statement of cash flows.

## d) Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired, unless the transaction is treated as an asset acquisition by applying the optional concentration test or otherwise. The optional concentration

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

test permits the acquirer to make an election on a transaction-by-transaction basis, and apply a simplified assessment for determining whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business. The optional concentration test is met, and the acquired set of activities and assets is not a business, if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgment is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition is comprised of:

- · fair values of the assets transferred;
- · fair values of liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
- · equity interests issued by the Company;
- · fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
- · fair value of any pre-existing equity interest.

At the acquisition date, identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

For each business combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as a financial liability is subsequently re-measured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, amount of non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity, over the fair value of the Company's share of net identifiable assets acquired.

If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference after reassessment, is recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as a bargain purchase

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Company's cash-generating units or the group of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

## e) Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any.

<!-- image -->

Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use.

Software for internal use which is acquired from third-party vendors and forms an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Other expenses" in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future

<!-- image -->

economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.

Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are depreciated separately based on their respective economic useful lives.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars         | Particulars                              | Years     |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Buildings           | Buildings                                | Buildings |
| -                   | Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 to 30  |
| -                   | Ancillary structures                     | 3 to 10   |
| Plant and equipment |                                          | 3 to 15   |
|                     | Furniture, fixtures and office equipment | 3 to 8    |
| Vehicles            |                                          | 4 to 5    |

The capitalized costs of software are amortized over the estimated useful life or the remaining useful life of the related tangible fixed asset, whichever is lower.

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

## f) Intangible assets other than goodwill

Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding are recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss when incurred. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes.

Development expenditures are capitalized only if:

- · development costs can be measured reliably;
- · the product or process is technically and commercially feasible;
- · future economic benefits are probable; and
- · the Company intends to, and has sufficient resources, to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

The expenditures to be capitalised include the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditures are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.

As of March 31, 2024, none of the development expenditure amounts have met the aforesaid recognition criteria for capitalisation.

Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognized as In-Process Research and Development ("IPR&D") assets. Subsequent expenditures on an IPR&D project acquired separately or in a business combination are:

- a) recognized as an expense when incurred, if it is a research expenditure;
- b) recognized as an expense when incurred, if it is a development expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38; or

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

- c) added to the carrying amount of the acquired IPR&D project, if it is a development expenditure that satisfies the recognition criteria in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38.

IPR&D assets are not amortized, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such IPR&D assets is recorded in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are initially recorded at cost. This includes payments to third parties in-licensed products, compounds and intellectual property. Intangible assets that have been acquired through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.

Subsequent expenditures on intangible assets are capitalised only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which they relate. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.

## Amortization

Intangible assets available for use with a definitive useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis and evaluated for potential impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortisation is recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortization expense is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                 | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 25 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 15 |

<!-- image -->

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful lives or expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate and are treated as change in accounting estimate.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

De-recognition of intangible assets Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## g) Leases

The Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For these short-term and low-value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In the case of arrangements involving lease and non-lease components, the Company allocates the consideration in the lease contract to the lease and non-lease components on the basis of the relative standalone price of each component.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. The cost of right-of-use

<!-- image -->

assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease over the shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the fixed and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate to be made over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to the standalone statement of Profit and Loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise information technology equipment and small items of office furniture.

## h) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work in progress and finished goods. The cost of all categories of inventories is determined based on the weighted average method. Cost includes purchase cost less refundable taxes, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

In the case of finished goods and work-inprogress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to reflect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## i) Impairment

## Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount is estimated for the asset or the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at March 31, or when circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

An impairment loss is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there are indicators that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

## j) Employee benefits

## Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

<!-- image -->

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is measured as the defined benefit obligation calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan is recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defined benefit obligation and plan assets are recognized in OCI in the period in which they arise

## Other long-term employee benefits

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The current service cost, past service cost as well as re-measurements are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualified actuary. The resultant expenses are recognized in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

<!-- image -->

## k) Share-based payments

Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee benefit expense, in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award if each portion of the award was, in substance, separate award. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options that vest.

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include the share price on the grant date, the exercise price of the instrument, the expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), the expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), the expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

<!-- image -->

## l) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

Contingent liabilities and contingent assets A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the standalone financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## m) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer as per the terms agreed upon with the customer. Generally, at that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of expected returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer since the Company acts as a principal in rendering those services..

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates.

Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

<!-- image -->

| Particulars                                                               | Point of recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales of generic  products in India                                       | Control over the generic products is  transferred by the Company when the  goods are delivered to distributors by  clearing and forwarding agents.                                                            |
| Export sales  and other sales  outside of India                           | Upon delivery of products to customers  (generally formulation manufacturers),  subject to the terms of the applicable  contract                                                                              |
| Sales of active  pharmaceutical  ingredients and  intermediates in  India | Upon delivery of products to  customers, unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for  specific revenue generating activities  to be completed, in which case  revenue is recognized once all such |

## Profit share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confirmation of units sold and net sales or net profit computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the

<!-- image -->

reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment received on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more performance obligations, the Company accounts for the completed obligation (for example, the transfer of title) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred

## Refund Liability

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience

of actual sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, and any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of the intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include

<!-- image -->

certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## n) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in other expenses.

## o) Other income and finance cost

Other income includes interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classified as investing activities in the standalone statement of cash flows. Finance costs consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss using the effective interest method unless capitalisation criteria are met as per accounting policy on Property, plant and equipment. The associated cash flows are classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.

## p) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised

<!-- image -->

in OCI or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in OCI or directly in equity respectively.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is not recognised for:

- · temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction that
- i. affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and;
- ii. does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences;
- · temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates if the timing of reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized,

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in

<!-- image -->

respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Withholding tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## q) Government grants and incentives

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Grants related to income and other incentives are

<!-- image -->

deducted in reporting the related expense in the standalone statement of Profit and Loss.

## r) Dividend

The Company recognises a liability to pay a dividend when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company.

In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by the Board of Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.

## s) Rounding of amounts

All amounts in Indian Rupees disclosed in the standalone financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million currency units unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for all financial and certain non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

<!-- image -->

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the standalone financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- · Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the standalone financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the management, based on market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained.

## a) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment

<!-- image -->

in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefits.

## b) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## c) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## d) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between

<!-- image -->

the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## e) Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## f) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS 113, "Fair Value Measurement" refers to as Level 3 inputs.

## 2.3 Goodwill

Goodwill arising upon business combinations is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired.

| Particulars                              | As at  March 31, 2024   | As at  March 31, 2023   |

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Particulars                          |   As at  March 31, 2024 |   As at  March 31, 2023 |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Global Generics-Branded Formulations |                     853 |                     853 |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value-in-use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

<!-- image -->

## 2.3 Goodwill (continued)

- a) Estimated cash flows for five years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rate used is 11.0% for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rate is 14.7%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

## 2.13 Revenue from contracts with customers and trade receivables (continued)

## Details of contract asset:

As mentioned in the accounting policies for refund liability set forth in note 1.3 (l) of these financial statements, the Company recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

As on March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company had ' 48 and ' 48, respectively as contract assets representing the right to returned goods.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on September 24, 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years from the vesting date.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on July 28, 2004 and on July 27, 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

## 2.25 Employee stock incentive plans (continued)

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend issued by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

| Particulars                                                       | Number of options  reserved under  category A   | Number of options  reserved under  category B   | Total     |

The term of the DRL 2002 plan was extended for a period of 10 years effective as of January 29, 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on July 20, 2012.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on July 27, 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and five years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years from vesting date.

## 2.25 Employee stock incentive plans (continued)

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

The Company's average effective tax rate for the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 were 25.03% and 32.42%, respectively.

The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2024, was lower as compared to the year ended March 31, 2023. This reduction was primarily on account of a decrease in the corporate income tax rate of the company as a result of the adoption of the corporate tax rate under section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act of India. Also, the tax expense/(benefit), net recorded for the year ended March 31, 2024 include certain credits and reversals arising on account of resolution/conclusion

## 2.27 Income taxes (continued)

of tax matters pertaining to past assessment year. However, the impact of such decrease in the corporate income tax rate was partially offset by following factors -

- (a) the Company had higher income from sale of capital assets in the year ended March 31, 2023 which was taxed at a lower rate compared to the corporate tax rate; and
- (b) during the year ended March 31, 2023 the company was eligible to claim certain tax deductions for income generated from its units located in special economic zones, which deductions were not available during the year ended March 31, 2024.

Overall, while the adoption of the new corporate tax rate contributed towards reduction in the Company's effective tax rate, various factors as described above played a role in partially offsetting this impact for the year ended March 31, 2024.

The Company has considered the impact of tax regulations and developments, including updates to its estimate on the impact of adoption of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 2019, in determining its "Tax expense" for the year ended March 31, 2023.

## d. Deferred tax assets and liabilities

The tax effects of significant temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of the items that created these differences is given below:

| Particulars                           | As at  March 31, 2024   | As at  March 31, 2023   |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Deferred tax assets/(liabilities):    |                         |                         |
| Trade receivables                     | 230                     | 206                     |
| Current liabilities and provisions    | 508                     | 490                     |
| Right to use assets                   | (189)                   | (114)                   |
| Other assets                          | 5                       | (10)                    |
| Property, plant and equipment         | (4,316)                 | (3,985)                 |
| Lease Liabilities                     | 208                     | 126                     |
| Investments                           | (607)                   | (105)                   |
| Net deferred tax assets/(Liabilities) | (4,161)                 | (3,392)                 |

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realized, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment.

## 2.29 Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in United States dollars, Russian roubles, U.K pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.28 above.

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- a) ' 7,041/(7,269) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 3,769/(3,881) increase/ (decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at March 31, 2024;
- b) ' 6,141/(6,221) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 4,278/(4,278) increase/ (decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at March 31, 2023;

| Total                       | 6,499  | 1,764  | 2,876             | 1,291         | 12,430      |

For the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by ' 4,113 and ' 4,081, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As at March 31, 2024 (March 31, 2023: ' Nil), the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows: ' 2,500 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill plus 5 bps; ' 4,600 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill plus 10 bps.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profiles, refer note 2.10A of these financial statements.

For the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., Treasury bill) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by ' 49 and ' Nil, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e, certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short and long durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

## b. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

For details of Financial guarantee, refer note 2.24.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specific industry sectors or specific country risks.

## Details of financial assets - not due, past due and impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at March 31, 2024. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days.

The ageing of trade receivables is given below:

| Particulars                        | As at  March 31, 2024   | As at  March 31, 2023   |

Refer note 2.6 B of these financial statements for the activity in the allowance for credit losses.

## Loans and advances

Loans and advances are predominantly given to subsidiaries for the purpose of working capital and other business requirements.

Refer note 2.6 C of these financial statements for the activity in the allowance for doubtful advances.

Other than trade receivables and loans and advances, the Company has no significant class of financial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ' 49,400 and ' 50,194 respectively.

As at March 31, 2024, the Company had working capital of ' 122,778, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 2,014, investments in term deposits with banks of ' 30,298, investments in bonds of ' 974, investment in commercial paper of ' 2,312 and investments in mutual funds of ' 37,757.

## 2.30 Contingent liabilities and commitments

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings (collectively, "Legal Proceedings"), including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company based on internal and external legal advices discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the Legal Proceedings referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its financial statements or cashflows, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such Legal Proceedings were to result in judgments against the Company, such judgments could be material to its results of operations or cashflows in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specified product" and fix the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfloxacin as a "specified product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fixing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by filing a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended March 31, 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfloxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fixed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High

## 2.30 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defence against the demand.

For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA filed a counter affidavit stating that the inclusion of Norfloxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On July 20, 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fixing of prices for Norfloxacin formulations.

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. In addition, the Company have filed writ petitions challenging the inclusion and designation of Theophylline/ Doxofylline, Cloxacillin and Ciprofloxacin as "specified products" as per DPCO 1995 and the related Demand Notices issued thereunder. The matters are tagged along with the Norfloxacin matter and have been adjourned to July 19, 2024 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On September 26, 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifications/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on October 25, 2016, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notified maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On March 20, 2017, the IPA filed an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated September 26, 2016. This recall application filed by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on October 4, 2017. Further, on December 13, 2017, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated October 4, 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on January 10, 2018.

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On July 13, 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had filed, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on July 21, 2017. On July 27, 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On August 3, 2017, the Company filed a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on August 8, 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on September 13, 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated September 15, 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High

## 2.30 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

Court. On November 22, 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to file a final counter affidavit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could file a rejoinder. On May 10, 2018, the counter affidavit was filed by the Union of India. The Company subsequently filed a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to July 31, 2024 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a cumulative provision of ' 437 ( ' 395 upto March 31, 2023) under "Selling, general and administrative expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On January 13, 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafil finished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and finished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the filing of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. The Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of said denial was also denied. The case is continuing in pretrial discovery.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these financial statements.

## (iii) Internal Investigation

The Company received an anonymous complaint in September 2020, alleging that healthcare professionals in Ukraine and potentially in other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the Company in violation of U.S. anti-corruption laws, specifically the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company disclosed the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and Securities Exchange Board of India. The Company engaged a U.S. law firm to conduct the investigation at the instruction of a committee of the Company's Board of Directors. On July 6, 2021 the Company received a subpoena from the SEC for the production of related documents, which were provided to the SEC.

The Company made presentations to the SEC and the DOJ in relation to the investigation with respect to certain countries during the previous fiscal years. The Company also made a presentation to the SEC and the DOJ in relation to its Global Compliance Framework, including the ongoing enhancement initiatives, during the year ended March 31, 2023. The Company is complying with its listing obligations as it relates to updating the regulatory agencies. While the findings from the aforesaid investigations could result in government or regulatory enforcement actions against the Company in the United States and/or foreign jurisdictions, which can lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws, the outcomes including liabilities are not reasonably ascertainable at this time.

## (iv) Environmental matters

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollaram and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effluents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fixed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on February 12, 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated October 30, 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee.

Land pollution

The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation

The NGT, Chennai in a judgment dated October 24, 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently filed a review petition against the judgment on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgment dated November 16, 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company filed an appeal challenging this judgment.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgment in July 2018 and directed the respondents to file their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the respondents filed counter affidavits and the matter has now been adjourned for final hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on October 25, 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing. The Hon'ble High Court has closed the matter in June 2022, by granting liberty for the Company to take proper recourse for remedies available under the NGT Act, 2010 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.

On April 24, 2019, based upon the judgment of the NGT, Chennai dated October 24, 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued GO.Ms. No. 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded fiscal year, i.e., March 31, 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended March 31, 2019.

During the three months ended September, 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated October 24, 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated April 24, 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated May 24, 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of such affected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram. The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application filed by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

## 2.30 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5% as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated August 03, 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G.O.Ms No. 24 dated April 24, 2019 and G.O.Ms No. 31 dated May 24, 2019 and basis the judgment of NGT, Chennai dated October 24, 2017 for the fiscal years 2015-2016 to 2018-2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2, CTO-3 and CTO-5 of the Company.

## (v) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from April 01, 2008 to March 31, 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from April 01, 2008 to March 31, 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges.

However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional financial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from April 01, 2012 to March 31, 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognizing the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from April 01, 2012 to March 31, 2013.

The Promoter Group cumulatively was to continue to hold the same number of shares in the Company, pre and post the amalgamation. All costs, charges and expenses relating to the Scheme will be borne out of the surplus assets of DRHL. Further, any expense, if exceeding the surplus assets of DRHL, will be borne directly by the Promoter Group.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020, the Scheme was approved by the board of directors, members and unsecured creditors of the Company. The no-observation letters from the BSE Limited and National Stock Exchange of India Limited were received on the basis of no comments received from Securities and Exchange Board of India ("SEBI"). The petition for approval of the said Scheme was filed with the Hon'ble NCLT, Hyderabad Bench.

The aforementioned Scheme was approved by the NCLT, Hyderabad Bench vide its Order dated April 05, 2022. Subsequently, the Company filed the NCLT order, with the Ministry of Company Affairs on April 08, 2022 ("Effective Date"). Pursuant to the Scheme of Amalgamation and Arrangement as approved by the NCLT, an aggregate of 41,325,300 equity shares, face value of ' 5 each held by DRHL in the share capital of the Company have been cancelled and an equivalent 41,325,300 number of equity shares, face value of ' 5 each were allotted to the shareholders of DRHL. There was no change in the total equity shareholding (Promoter/Public Shareholding) of the Company, on account of the allotment/ cancellation of equity shares pursuant to the approved Scheme.

The Scheme also provides that the Promoters of the Company will jointly and severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company, its directors, employees, officers, representatives, or any other person authorized by the Company (excluding the Promoters) for any liability, claim, or demand, which may devolve upon the Company on account of this amalgamation.

## Independent Auditor's Report

To the Members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Dr Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Holding Company"), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group"), its associate and joint ventures comprising of the consolidated Balance sheet as at March 31 2024, the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income, the consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated financial statements, including a summary of material accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as "the consolidated financial statements").

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of the subsidiaries the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, its associate and joint ventures as at March 31, 2024, their consolidated profit including other comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act.

Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group, associate and joint ventures in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us by the management, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contingencies, including litigations (as described in note 1.3(m) of the material accounting policies, and note 2.33 (A) containing details of contingencies in the consolidated financial statements)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

The Company recognizes a liability for those legal contingencies for which it has a possible or a present obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. The Company assisted by their internal and external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose the need to make provision or discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

This area is significant to our audit, since auditing management's determination of whether a loss for a contingency are probable and reasonably estimable, reasonably possible or remote, and the related disclosures, is highly subjective and requires significant judgment.

## Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to completeness, valuation, presentation and disclosure of legal contingencies.
- · To test the Company's contingencies, our substantive audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness of the contingencies subject to evaluation by the Company through review of minutes of board meetings and evaluation of legal expenses.
- · We also evaluated the Company's analysis of its assessment of the probability of outcome for each material contingency through inspection of responses to inquiry letters sent to external legal counsel, discussions with internal counsel, as well as external legal counsel, when deemed necessary, to confirm our understanding of the allegations and potential outcomes and obtaining written representations from executives of the Company.
- · We also evaluated the adequacy of Company's disclosures in relation to these matters.

Chargebacks, rebates and refund liability, related to revenue (as described in note 1.3(n) of the material accounting policies of consolidated financial statements and note 2.14 of the consolidated financial statements)

Revenues from product sales are recognized upon transfer of control to a customer, usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer, net of accruals for estimated chargebacks, rebates (which includes contractual obligations relating to other pricing adjustments), and sales returns, (collectively sales deductions), which are estimated at the time of sale, to reflect the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled.

Auditing the estimation of sales deductions, which are netted against product sales, is complex and requires significant judgment. The estimated sales deductions are based on assumptions and inputs used in the estimate, such as current contractual terms, wholesaler inventory levels, and historical data. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

## Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes.
- · We also tested management's controls over the methods for making estimates, data and assumptions of the estimates used to calculate the sales deductions including actual sales, contractual terms, and historical data such as actual customer inventory levels of the Company's products, and estimated sales subject to sales deductions.
- · We have tested management's controls with respect to identification and evaluation and compliance of rebates (which includes contractual obligations relating to other pricing adjustments) and management's controls over the accuracy and completeness of the estimates used to calculate the final sales deductions.
- · We tested management's estimated sales deductions and obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates. We tested management's estimates over the determination of sales deductions accruals by comparing the rates and pricing clauses used in management's estimate to rates in the underlying contracts and historical sales deductions data.
- · We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, as applicable to current payment trends.

financial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated financial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group including its associate and joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of their respective companies and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associate and joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of their respective companies to

<!-- image -->

continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of their respective companies.

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3) (i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its associate and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associate and joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.

- · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- · Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint ventures of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the Consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of

<!-- image -->

most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## Other Matters

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, in so far as it relates to the amounts and disclosures included in respect of this subsidiary and our report in terms of sub-sections (3) of Section 143 of the Act, in so far as it relates to the aforesaid subsidiary is based solely on the report of such other auditors.

## TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMTED

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company") as of and for the year ended March 31, 2024, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group"), which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with

reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Group, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at March 31, 2024, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding

Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

## Other Matters

## 1.2 Basis of preparation of consolidated financial statements

## a) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended March 31, 2024 comply in all material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, and as amended from time to time.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective at the Company's annual reporting date, March 31, 2024. These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on May 07, 2024.

## b) Basis of measurement

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention, except for the following material items in the balance sheet which are measured on the basis stated below and in accordance with the respective accounting policies:

- · derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;
- · financial assets and financial liabilities are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost, depending on the classification based on accounting policy;
- · long-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method;
- · equity-settled and cash-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value on the grant date and the reporting date, respectively;
- · assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations are measured at fair value on the acquisition date; and
- · contingent consideration arising out of business combination are measured at fair value.

## c) Use of judgments, estimates and assumptions

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses, the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates implies that actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes:

under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time.

On March 31, 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from April 01, 2023, as below:

## Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to Ind AS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements

The amendments to Ind AS 1 aim to help entities provide accounting policy disclosures that are more useful by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their 'significant' accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their 'material' accounting policies and adding guidance on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.

The company adopted the amendments to Ind AS 1 effective as of April 1, 2023. The amendments did not result in any changes in the accounting policies themselves, nor they had any impact on recognition, measurement or presentation of any items in these financial statements. However, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed, in the note 1.3 of these consolidated financial statements.

## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to Ind AS 12

The amendments to Ind AS 12 "Income Taxes" narrow the scope of the initial recognition exception, so that it no longer applies to transactions that give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences such as leases and decommissioning liabilities

The Company previously recognised deferred tax on leases, resulting in a similar outcome as apply under the amendments, except that the deferred tax asset or liability was recognised on a net basis. Following the amendments, the Company has recognised a separate deferred tax asset in relation to its lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability in relation to its right-to-use assets as at 1 April 2022 and thereafter. However, there was no impact on the consolidated balance sheet because the balances qualify for offset under paragraph 74 of Ind AS 12. The key impact for the Company relates to disclosure of the deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised.

## Definition of Accounting Estimates - Amendments to Ind AS 8

The amendments to Ind AS 8 "Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting estimates and errors" introduce a new definition of 'accounting estimates' and clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates, changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. They also clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates.

These amendments had no impact in the consolidated financial statements.

## b) Basis of consolidation

## Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements comprise the consolidated financial statements of the Parent company and its subsidiaries as at March 31, 2024. Subsidiaries are all entities that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company (i) has power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee), (ii) is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and (iii) has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. The Company re-assesses whether or not it controls a subsidiary if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements of control. The consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date when the Company obtains control and continues until the date that control ceases.

## Joint arrangements (equity accounted investees)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the parties have joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. The considerations made in determining whether significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

<!-- image -->

Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest ("NCI") holders have certain significant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in significant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities.

Subsequent to initial recognition, the investment includes the company's share of the profit or loss and Other comprehensive Income ("OCI") of equity accounted investees, until the date on which joint control ceases .

Associates (equity accounted investees) An associate is an entity over which the Company has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies. Interest in Associates are accounted using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost.

Profits and losses arising on transactions between the Company and its associates are recognised only to the extent of unrelated investors' interests in the associate. The investor's share in the associate's profits and losses resulting from these transactions is eliminated against the carrying value of the associate.

In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying value of the equity accounted investee.

## Consolidation procedure

Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements. Profit or loss and

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

each component of OCI are attributed to the equity holders of the parent of the Company.

All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between members of the Company are eliminated in full on consolidation.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies of subsidiaries, joint venture and associates have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. Furthermore, the consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries, joint venture and associate are prepared for the same reporting period as of the Company.

## c) Foreign currency

Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All financial information presented, except information related to share and per share data, in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these entities are largely restricted to importing of finished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash flows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The costs incurred by these entities are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The financing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been generally determined to be the local currency of

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

those countries/regions, unless use of a different currency is considered appropriate.

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- · certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value in OCI and;
- · qualifying cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are effective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash flows had occurred at the measurement date.

## Foreign operations

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the reporting currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the reporting currency at the monthly average exchange rates

<!-- image -->

prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in its entirety, partially, such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the relevant amount in the FCTR is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## d) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables generally do not contain any significant financing component requiring separation and are therefore recognized initially at the transaction price determined as per Ind AS 115 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

- · Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- · Debt instruments at Fair value through OCI (FVTOCI);
- · Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss (FVTPL); and
- · Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

<!-- image -->

Debt instruments at amortised cost A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in consolidated statement of profit and loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially at fair value plus transaction cost and subsequently at each reporting date at the fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Company recognizes interest income (calculated using the

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

effective interest rate method), impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of Profit & loss. On de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI is reclassified to the consolidated statement of Profit & loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies, are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value in OCI. The Company makes such election upon initial recognition on an instrument-byinstrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment.

However, on sale the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheet) when:

- · the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
- · Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables and other financial assets, if any, representing a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset. All equity investments and debt investments designated as FVTPL are not subject to impairment assessment.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition and measurement of impairment loss allowance on the contract asset and trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognizes impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the

<!-- image -->

trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities at FVTPL primarily comprise derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company and not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationship as defined by Ind AS 109.

Gains or losses on such financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

The Company has not designated any financial liability as FVTPL.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using

<!-- image -->

the effective interest rate method and, thereby, any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit & loss over the period of the borrowings.

The effective interest rate amortization is included under the head finance expense in the consolidated statement of profit & loss.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. Gain or loss arising on de-recognition, measured as difference between, the carrying amount of financial liability and the settlement amount, is recognized under the head finance costs in consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## Derivative financial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in U.S. dollars, U.K. pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus, Australian dollars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in U.S. dollars, Russian roubles, Mexican pesos, Ukrainian hryvnias and Brazilian reals.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classified as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the OCI and accumulated in the hedging reserve as a component of equity. If the hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial item, the amount accumulated in equity is removed from the hedging reserve and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability. In all other cases, the amount so accumulated is re-classified to the consolidated statement of profit & loss and presented as part of the hedged item in the same period in which the forecasted transaction impacts the consolidated statement of profit & loss. The ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit & loss as finance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to such relationships. Re-measurement gains or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities are recorded in the same manner as stated above for derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in OCI remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in OCI is recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit & loss.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

the date of investment. Bank overdrafts, which are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Company's cash management, are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

## e) Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired, unless the transaction is treated as an asset acquisition by applying the optional concentration test or otherwise. The optional concentration test permits the acquirer to make an election on a transaction-by-transaction basis, and apply a simplified assessment for determining whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a business. The optional concentration test is met, and the acquired set of activities and assets is not a business, if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgment is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition is comprised of:

- · fair values of the assets transferred;

<!-- image -->

- · fair values of liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
- · equity interests issued by the Company;
- · fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
- · fair value of any pre-existing equity interest.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities in business combination assumed are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values. For each business combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingent consideration classified as a financial liability is subsequently re-measured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, amount of non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and the acquisition date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity, over the fair value of the Company's share of net identifiable assets acquired.

If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference, after reassessment, is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as a bargain purchase

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the

<!-- image -->

purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Company's cash-generating units or the group of cash generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

## f) Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use.

Software for internal use which is acquired from third-party vendors and forms an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred.

Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs. Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalized as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognized in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit & loss as incurred.

Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised within Other income/Other expenses in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. The depreciation expense is included in the costs of the functions using the asset. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are depreciated separately based on their respective economic useful lives.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                              | Particulars                              | Years     |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Buildings                                | Buildings                                | Buildings |
| -                                        | Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 to 50  |
| -                                        | Ancillary structures                     | 3 to 15   |
| Plant and equipment                      | Plant and equipment                      | 3 to 15   |
| Furniture, fixtures and office equipment | Furniture, fixtures and office equipment | 3 to 10   |
| Vehicles                                 | Vehicles                                 | 4 to 5    |

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

The capitalised costs of software are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the related tangible fixed asset, whichever is lower.

## g) Intangible assets other than goodwill

Recognition and measurement

Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit & loss when incurred. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes.

Development expenditures are capitalized only if:

- · development costs can be measured reliably;
- · the product or process is technically and commercially feasible;
- · future economic benefits are probable; and
- · the Company intends to, and has sufficient resources, to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

The expenditures to be capitalised include the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditures are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit & loss as incurred.

As of March 31, 2024, none of the development expenditure amounts have met the aforesaid recognition criteria for capitalisation.

<!-- image -->

Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognized as In-Process Research and Development ("IPR&D") assets. Subsequent expenditures on an IPR&D project acquired separately or in a business combination are:

- · recognized as an expense when incurred, if it is a research expenditure;
- · recognized as an expense when incurred, if it is a development expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38; or
- · added to the carrying amount of the acquired IPR&D project, if it is a development expenditure that satisfies the recognition criteria in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38.

IPR&D assets are not amortized, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such IPR&D assets is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit & loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

Intangible assets that are acquired by the Company are initially recorded at cost. This includes payments to third parties in-licensed products, compounds and intellectual property. Intangible assets that have been acquired through a business combination are initially recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.

Subsequent expenditures on intangible assets are capitalised only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which they relate. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit & loss as incurred.

## Amortization

Intangible assets available for use with a definitive useful life are amortized on a straight-line basis and evaluated for potential impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortisation is recognized

<!-- image -->

in the consolidated statement of profit & loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortization expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit & loss in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                 | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 25 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 15 |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful lives or expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate and are treated as change in accounting estimate.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## h) Leases

The Company recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability for all arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) and low-value leases. For these short-term and low-value leases,

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In the case of arrangements involving lease and non-lease components, the Company allocates the consideration in the lease contract to the lease and non-lease components on the basis of the relative standalone price of each component.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. The cost of right-of-use assets includes the amount of lease liabilities recognised, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis from the commencement date of the lease over the shorter of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term and are assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable using cash flow projections for the useful life.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the fixed and variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate to be made over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or the Company's incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to consolidated statement of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise Information technology equipment and small items of office furniture.

<!-- image -->

## i) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work in progress and finished goods. The cost of all categories of inventories is determined based on the weighted average method. Cost includes purchase cost less refundable taxes, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

In the case of finished goods and work-inprogress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to reflect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## j) Impairment

Non-financial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the recoverable amount is estimated for the asset or the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available

<!-- image -->

for use, an impairment test is performed each year at March 31 or when circumstances indicate that carrying value may be impaired.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there are

<!-- image -->

indicators that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and reversed if there has been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## k) Employee benefits

## Short-term employee benefits

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is the defined benefit obligation calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Past service costs are recognized immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defined benefit obligation and plan assets are recognized in OCI in the period in which they arise

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value by independent actuaries using the projected

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

unit credit method. The current service cost, past service cost as well as re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualified actuary. The resultant expenses are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit & loss.

## l) Share-based payments

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognized as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit & loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized is based on the number of awards that meet the related service at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award if each portion of the award was, in substance, a separate award. The increase in equity recognized in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options that vest.

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

Cash settled share-based payment transactions The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.

The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## m) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance Costs.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

<!-- image -->

Contingent liabilities and contingent assets A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## n) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer as per the terms agreed upon with the customer. Generally, at that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of expected returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer since the Company acts as a principal in rendering those services.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the

<!-- image -->

The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates. Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

## Particulars

## Point of recognition of revenue

Sales of generic products in India

Sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in India

Export sales and other sales outside of India

Control is transferred upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company.

Upon delivery of products to customers, unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for specific revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognized once all such activities are completed.

Upon delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), subject to the terms of the applicable contract.

## Profit share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

partner to provide confirmation of units sold and net sales or net profit computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment received on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more performance obligations, the Company accounts for the completed obligation (for example, the transfer of title) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Rebates are deductions based on contractual obligations which include direct rebates, indirect rebates and other pricing adjustments. Provisions for such chargebacks, rebates and discounts are accrued and estimated based on the terms of the agreement with the wholesaler, historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler. The provision represents estimates of the related obligations, requiring the use of judgment when estimating the effect of these revenue deductions.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and accruals for Shelf stock adjustments depend on future events upon material right obtained by customer when the prices of certain products decline as a result of price competition, new competitive launches or otherwise. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifically limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be offered.

## Refund Liability

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company

<!-- image -->

deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of actual sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability, the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, and any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of the intellectual property, and

<!-- image -->

other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## o) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in other expenses.

## p) Other income and finance cost

Other income include interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of financial assets. Interest income is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows.

Finance costs consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognized in the consolidated statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method unless capitalisation criteria are met as per accounting policy on Property, plant and Equipment. The associated cash flows are classified as financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and/or other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.

<!-- image -->

## q) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in OCI or directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in OCI directly in equity, respectively. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.

Deferred tax is not recognized for:

- · temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination if at the time of the transaction, it
- i. affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss and
- ii. does not give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences;
- · temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilized.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Withholding tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously, in each future period in which significant amounts of deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or recovered.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## r) Government grants and incentives

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Grants related

<!-- image -->

to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## s) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and accordingly is identified as the chief operating decision maker.

## t) Dividend

The Company recognises a liability to pay a dividend when the distribution is authorised, and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company.

In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared by Board of Directors. In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of the Company.

## u) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million Currency units unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for all financial and certain non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the

<!-- image -->

absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- · Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the Management, based on market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained

## a) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

(the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefits.

## b) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## c) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## d) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## e) Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## f) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS 113, "Fair Value Measurement" refers to as Level 3 inputs.

Impairment losses recorded for the year ended March 31, 2023

During the year ended March 31, 2023, the Company assessed performance of the Nimbus Health business against the initial estimates and recognized an impairment charge of the carrying values of ' 272. This impairment loss pertains to the Company's Global Generics segment.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill (other than those arising upon investment in a joint venture) was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Particulars                              | As at  March 31, 2024   | As at  March 31, 2023   |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Global Generics-Germany Operations       | 2,397                   | 2,386                   |
| Global Generics-Complex Injectables      | 2,021                   | 2,011                   |
| Global Generics-Branded Formulations     | 905                     | 905                     |
| PSAI-Active Pharmaceutical Operations    | 177                     | 171                     |
| Global Generics-North America Operations | 1                       | 1                       |
|                                          | 5,501                   | 5,474                   |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value in use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash flows for five years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used range from 6.8% to 11% for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rates range from 7.9% to 14.7%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

Pursuant to certain arrangement with a bank, the Company sold to the bank certain of its trade receivables forming part of its Global Generics segment, on a non-recourse basis. The receivables sold were mutually agreed upon with the respective bank after considering the creditworthiness and contractual terms with the customer. The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such receivables sold to the respective bank, and accordingly, the same were derecognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the years ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of trade receivables derecognised pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement was ' 14,790 and ' 12,376, respectively.

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on its trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers. The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 are as follows:

*Currently, the Company do not separately track provisions and adjustments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks. However, the adjustments are expected to be non-material. The volumes used to calculate the closing balance of chargebacks represent approximately 1.1 to 1.4 months equivalent of sales, which corresponds to the pending chargeback claims yet to be processed.

- ** Currently, the Company does not separately track the credits and payments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks, rebates, Medicaid payments or refund liability.
- (1) Chargebacks provisions and payments for the year ended March 31, 2024 were each higher as compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of generic portfolio acquisition from Mayne Pharma w.e.f. Apr'23, higher sales volumes and also due to higher pricing rates per unit for chargebacks on account of reduction in the contract prices through which the product is resold in the retail part of the supply chain for certain of the Company's products. The rebate provisions and payments for the year ended March 31, 2024 were each higher as compared to the year ended March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of generic portfolio acquisition from Mayne Pharma, higher sales volumes for the base portfolio products.
- (2) The Company's overall provision for refund liability as of March 31, 2024 relating to the Company's North America Generics business was US$35, compared to a liability of US$35 as of March 31, 2023. The refund liability created for new product launches, volume growth, were off- set by the reduction in the contract price & mix change.

The estimates of "gross-to-net" adjustments for the Company's operations in India and other countries outside of the United States relate mainly to refund liability in all such operations, and certain rebates to healthcare insurance providers are specific to the Company's German operations. The pattern of such refund liability is generally consistent with the Company's gross sales. In Germany, the rebates to healthcare insurance providers mentioned above are contractually fixed in nature and do not involve significant estimations by the Company.

## Details of contract asset:

As mentioned in the accounting policies for refund liability set forth in note 1.3 (n) of these consolidated financial statements, the Company recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods), which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

As on March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company had ' 48 and ' 48, respectively, as contract assets representing the right to returned goods

## 2.26 Segment reporting

The Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by operating segments. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit as the performance indicator for all of the operating segments, and does not review the total assets and liabilities of an operating segment. The office of Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") is the CODM of the Company.

The Company's reportable operating segments are as follows:

- · Global Generics;
- · Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI");
- · Others.*

As discussed below, Proprietary Products ceased to be a reportable operating segment effective April 1, 2022.

Global Generics: This segment consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing prescription and over-thecounter finished pharmaceutical products ready for consumption by the patient, marketed under a brand name (branded formulations) or as generic finished dosages with therapeutic equivalence to branded formulations (generics). This segment includes the operations of the Company's biologics business.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients: This segment primarily consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as "API", which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. The Company also serves its customers with incremental value added products, including semi-finished and finished formulations, which are included in this segment. This segment also includes the Company's pharmaceutical services business, which provides contract research services and manufactures and sells active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with the specific customer requirements.

Others*: This segment consists of the Company's other business operations which includes its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Aurigene Oncology Limited ("AOL") (formerly Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited), SVAAS Wellness Limited ("SVAAS"), and the Company's Proprietary Products business. AOL is a discovery stage biotechnology company developing novel and best-in-class therapies in the fields of oncology and inflammation. AOL works with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through customized models of drug-discovery collaborations. SVAAS is in the business of providing digital healthcare and information technology enabled business support services. The Proprietary Products business focuses on the research and development of differentiated formulations and is expected to earn revenues arising out of monetization of such assets and subsequent royalties, if any.

*As the revenues and gross profits of the Proprietary Products segment are considerably lower than the quantitative thresholds mentioned in INDAS 108, "Operating Segments", the Company believes that Proprietary Products segment no longer qualifies to be a reportable segment and consequently, effective April 1, 2022, the Company included the financial information relating to its Proprietary Products segment in "Others". The corresponding information relating to the Proprietary Products segment for earlier periods has been restated to reflect the aforementioned change.

The measurement of each segment's revenues, expenses and assets is consistent with the accounting policies that are used in preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

## 2.29 Employee stock incentive plans

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan, 2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on September 24, 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years from the vesting date.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on July 28, 2004 and on July 27, 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend issued by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

The Company instituted the DRL 2007 Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on July 27, 2005. The DRL 2007 Plan became effective upon its approval by the Board of Directors on January 22, 2007. The DRL 2007 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Committee administers the DRL 2007 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2007 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years from vesting date.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan")

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on July 27, 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and five years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years from vesting date.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

## 2.29 Employee stock incentive plans (continued)

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control.

As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognized in the consolidated statement of profit & loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2024, was lower as compared to the year ended March 31, 2023. This reduction was primarily on account of a decrease in the corporate income tax rate of the parent company as a result of the adoption of the corporate tax rate under section 115BAA of the Income Tax Act of India. Also, the tax expense/(benefit), net

## 2.30 Income taxes (continued)

recorded for the year ended March 31, 2024, include certain credits and reversals arising on account of resolution/conclusion of tax matters pertaining to past assessment year. However, the impact of such decrease in the corporate income tax rate was partially offset by following factors -

- (a) changes in the jurisdictional mix of earnings: There was an increase in the proportion of the Company's profits coming from higher tax jurisdictions and a decrease in the proportion of profits from lower tax jurisdictions for the year ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2023.
- (b) the Company had higher income from sale of capital assets in the year ended March 31, 2023 which was taxed at a lower rate compared to the corporate tax rate; and
- (c) during the year ended March 31, 2023, the parent company was eligible to claim certain tax deductions for income generated from its units located in special economic zones, which deductions were not available during the year ended March 31, 2024.

Overall, while the adoption of the new corporate tax rate contributed towards reduction in the Company's effective tax rate, various factors as described above played a role in partially offsetting this impact for the period ended March 31, 2024.

The company has considered the impact of recent tax regulations and developments, including updates to its estimate on the impact of adoption of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 2019, in determining its "Tax expense/(benefit)" for the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.

During the year ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, the Company recognized deferred tax assets on certain operating tax losses, primarily pertaining to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories SA, Switzerland, to the extent the Company believes based on forecasted revenues and profits, that it is probable there will be available taxable profits against which such tax losses can be utilized.

Deferred tax liability is not provided on undistributed earnings of ' 41,369 and ' 31,724 as of March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively of subsidiaries, where it is expected that earnings of the subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realized, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry-forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realize the benefits of those recognized deductible differences and tax loss carry-forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Operating loss carry-forward consists of business losses, unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed interest carry-forwards. A portion of this total loss can be carried indefinitely and the remaining amounts expire at various various dates ranging from 2025 through 2040.

## 2.31 Financial instruments (continued)

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes

A net gain/loss of ' Nil, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the foreign exchange gains and losses and finance costs. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of finance costs, a net loss of ' (77) and ' Nil for the year ended 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2023, respectively.

The Company had outstanding cross currency swap against INR Borrowing of ' Nil as at March 31, 2024 and ' Nil as on March 31, 2023. The swap hedges the principal repayment of underlying INR liability and transforms it into US$ Principal repayment liability.

## 2.32 Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (U.K. pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus, Austrailian dollars and Euros ) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars, Russian roubles, Mexican pesos, Ukrainian hryvnias and Brazilian reals). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.31 to these consolidated financial statements.

## 2.32 Financial risk management (continued)

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% increase/(decrease) in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- · ' 7,041/(7,269) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 2,203/(2,315) increase/ (decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at March 31, 2024
- · ' 5,902/(5,905) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 3,118/(3,118) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at March 31, 2023;

2.32 Financial risk management (continued)

## Interest rate risk

As at March 31, 2024, the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows:

' 2,500 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill plus 5 bps;

' 4,600 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill + 10 bps;

' 3800 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill + 84 bps;

' 2,302 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of Key rate + spread ranging from 2.53% to 2.76% ; and

' 2,674 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of TIIE+1.35%.

As of March 31, 2023, the Company had ' 648 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of CDI+1.2% and ' 2,414 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of TIIE+1.15%.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profiles, refer to Note 17 of these consolidated financial statements.

For the years ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023 every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., CDI, and TIIE) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by ' 144, ' 37 respectively.

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings, interest component of which was designated in a cash flow hedge, was ' 0 as of March 31, 2024 and 2023.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

"CDI" means Brazilian interbank deposit rate (Certificado de Depósito Interbancário) and "TIIE" means the Equilibrium Inter-banking Interest Rate (Tasa de Interés Interbancaria de Equilibrio),.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As at March 31, 2024, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

## b. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on

## 2.32 Financial risk management (continued)

credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specific industry sectors or specific country risks.

## Details of financial assets - not due, past due and impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at March 31, 2024. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days.

The ageing of trade receivables is given below:

| Particulars                        | As at  March 31, 2024   | As at  March 31, 2023   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Neither past due nor impaired      | 71,350                  | 65,528                  |
| Past due                           |                         |                         |
| Less than 365 days                 | 8,648                   | 7,092                   |

| Past due - Impaired                |                         |                         |
| Less than 365 days                 | 32                      | -                       |
| More than 365 days                 | 1,307                   | 1,123                   |
|                                    | 81,749                  | 73,743                  |
| Less : Allowance for credit losses | (1,451)                 | (1,258)                 |
| Total                              | 80,298                  | 72,485                  |

See Note 2.7 B of these consolidated financial statements for the activity in the allowance for credit losses.

Other than trade receivables, the Company has no significant class of financial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings (collectively, "Legal Proceedings"), including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is often difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company, based on internal and external legal advice, assesses the need to make a provision or discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the Legal Proceedings referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such Legal Proceedings were to result in judgments against the Company, such judgments could be material to its results of operations or cash flows in a given period.

## Product and patent related matters

## Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specified product" and fix the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfloxacin as a "specified product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fixing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by filing a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended March 31, 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfloxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fixed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defence against the demand.

For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA filed a counter affidavit stating that the inclusion of Norfloxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On July 20, 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fixing of prices for Norfloxacin formulations.

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. In addition, the Company have filed writ petitions challenging the inclusion and designation of Theophylline/ Doxofylline, Cloxacillin and Ciprofloxacin as "specified products" as per DPCO 1995 and the related Demand Notices issued thereunder. The matters are tagged along with the Norfloxacin matter and have been adjourned to July 19, 2024 for hearing

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On September 26, 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifications/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on October 25, 2016, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

During the three months ended December 31, 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notified maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On March 20, 2017, the IPA filed an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated September 26, 2016. This recall application filed by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on October 4, 2017. Further, on December 13, 2017, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated October 4, 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on January 10, 2018.

During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On July 13, 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had filed, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on July 21, 2017. On July 27, 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On August 3, 2017, the Company filed a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on August 8, 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on September 13, 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated September 15, 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On November 22, 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to file a final counter affidavit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could file a rejoinder. On May 10, 2018, the counter affidavit was filed by the Union of India. The Company subsequently filed a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to July 31, 2024 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a cumulative provision of ' 437 ( ' 395 upto March 31, 2023) under "Selling, general and administrative expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Other product and patent related matters

## Ranitidine recall and litigation

On October 1, 2019, the Company initiated a voluntary nationwide recall (at the retail level for over-the-counter products and at the consumer level for prescription products) of its ranitidine medications sold in the United States due to the presence of N-Nitrosodimethylamine ("NDMA") above levels established by the U.S. FDA. On November 1, 2019, the U.S. FDA issued a statement indicating that it had found levels of NDMA in ranitidine from its testing generally that were "similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats." See https://www.fda.gov/news-events/ press-announcements/statement-new-testing-results-including-low-levels-impurities-ranitidine-drugs . On April 1, 2020, the U.S. FDA issued a press release announcing that it was requesting manufacturers to withdraw all prescription and over-the-counter ranitidine drugs from the market immediately. See https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-requestsremoval-all-ranitidine-products-zantac-market.

Individual federal court personal injury lawsuits, as well as various class actions, were transferred to the In re Zantac (Ranitidine) Products Liability Litigation Multidistrict Litigation in the Southern District of Florida, MDL-2924 ("MDL-2924"). The Company and/ or one or more of its U.S. subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in over 3,275 lawsuits in MDL-2924. Approximately 3,000 of those cases have been filed since the MDL-2924 Court's Daubert ruling which triggered a deadline for filings by claimants in the census registry who agreed to file their lawsuits in federal court. The census registry established in MDL-2924

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

included tens of thousands of claimants who did not file complaints but preserved claims against the many pharmaceutical manufacturer, distributor and retailer defendants in MDL-2924. In August of 2022, the defendants exited all registry plaintiffs alleging non-designated cancers (i.e. types of cancers that are not being pursued by plaintiffs' leadership in the MDL-2924) and all registry plaintiffs alleging designated cancers who did not commit to filing a complaint in federal court. As a result, state court filings commenced. MDL-2924 also involves a proposed nationwide consumer class action and a proposed nationwide class action for medical monitoring. A third-party payor class action was dismissed without prejudice. On November 7, 2022, that dismissal was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

On December 31, 2020, the MDL-2924 Court ruled on multiple motions to dismiss in MDL-2924 and granted the generic manufacturers' (the Company is a generic manufacturer) motion to dismiss based on federal preemption. The plaintiffs' failure-towarn and design defect claims against the Company were dismissed with prejudice, but the Court permitted plaintiffs to attempt to replead several claims/theories. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaints and the defendants, including the Company, filed motions to dismiss seeking dismissal of all claims against them on March 24, 2021. On July 8, 2021, the Court dismissed all claims, including the proposed nationwide consumer class action and proposed nationwide class action for medical monitoring, against the Company and other generic manufacturers with prejudice based on federal preemption. The MDL-2924 Court's dismissal decisions have been piecemeal appealed by plaintiffs to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, resulting in at least five rounds of appeals. Motions to dismiss rounds two and three of plaintiffs' appeals were filed, but no merits briefing or oral argument occurred. In addition, rounds two and three of plaintiffs' appeals were stayed in light of three separate bankruptcy proceedings involving co-defendants Par Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of Endo), Lannett Co. and Rite Aid.

While the generic manufacturer defendants were previously dismissed with prejudice from MDL-2924 on federal preemption grounds, the brand manufacturer defendants were not dismissed, and therefore continued to litigate. Following substantial briefing and argument, on December 6, 2022, the MDL-2924 Court entered an Omnibus Order on All Pending Daubert Motions and Defendants' Summary Judgment Motion. In so doing, the Court granted brand defendants' motions to exclude plaintiffs' expert witnesses and entered summary judgment in favor of the brand defendants as to all claims involving bladder, esophageal, gastric, liver, and pancreatic cancers (the "designated cancers"). The MDL-2924 Court then set a deadline of April 12, 2023 for plaintiffs to identify whether they plan to provide general causation expert reports as to any non-designated cancers. On July 14, 2023, the MDL-2924 Court entered an Order dismissing all non-designated cancer cases with prejudice as to all defendants (including generics) based on plaintiffs' failure to comply with prior Court Orders regarding the disclosure of experts. In addition, the MDL-2924 Court issued an order to show cause why summary judgment should not be entered for designated cancers as to all defendants and an order to show cause why summary judgment should not be entered against all plaintiffs for designated cancers, regardless of the date the case was filed. Briefing on the show cause orders took place in April and May of 2023. On May 15, 2023, the MDL-2924 Court issued an order entering summary judgment pursuant to rule 56(f), granting summary judgment on the basis of Daubert as to all defendants (including generics) in all cases alleging designated cancers filed before May 5, 2023. The MDL-2924 Court also issued a Third Order to Show Cause pertaining to the economic class action complaint, and dismissed all economic loss class action cases on July 26, 2023 for lack of standing. Since the MDL-2924 Court's Daubert decision, more than a thousand plaintiffs have filed Notices of Appeal. The MDL-2924 Court issued an indicative ruling, finding that, if the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit (the "11th Circuit") returns jurisdiction to the MDL-2924 District Court, it would grant summary judgment in favor of the generic defendants based on Daubert as to the designated cancers. In light of the indicative ruling, the non-brand defendants asked the 11th Circuit to remand the pending appeals back to the MDL-2924 Court, and the plaintiffs opposed. On September 8, 2023, the 11th Circuit severed the bankrupt defendant Par

Pharmaceuticals and remanded all appeals of cases naming brands and generics ("mixed-use cases") in the second, third, and fourth round of appeals back to the MDL-2924 Court. On September 26, 2023, the MDL-2924 Court entered Rule 58 judgment in favor of all defendants (excluding severed bankrupt defendant Par Pharmaceuticals) as to all designated cancer cases. The Court ordered further briefing regarding entry of final judgment in non-designated cancer cases that were on appeal but now have been remanded. On November 14, 2023, the MDL-2924 Court entered Rule 58 judgment in favor of all non-brand defendants (except for bankrupt Par), in non-designated cancer cases that had been appealed and remanded following the

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

indicative ruling. The 11th Circuit consolidated another set of appeals, representing a fifth round, under lead plaintiff Townsend. So far, the fifth round involves mostly brand-only cases along with a limited number of mixed-use cases. The defendants have not yet moved to remand the mixed-use case appeals lead plaintiff Townsend. On December 26, 2023, the 11th Circuit consolidated the appeals arising from the MDL-2924 for disposition before the same panel. The Court ordered the parties to brief generic preemption separately, but on the same schedule with all the other issues on appeal.

Several ranitidine-related actions are currently pending against the Company in state courts. The New Mexico State Attorney General filed suit against the Company's U.S. subsidiary, and multiple other manufacturers and retailers. The State of New Mexico asserted claims of statutory and common law public nuisance and negligence against the Company. The Company joined in an effort to transfer the case from the Santa Fe County Court to MDL-2924, but the case was remanded by the MDL-2924 Court to the Santa Fe County Court. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on April 16, 2021. The defendants' motions to dismiss, including the Company's federal preemption motion to dismiss, were denied. The case is currently in the discovery stage. Trial has been scheduled on or after September 15, 2025. In November 2020, the City of Baltimore filed a similar action against the Company's U.S. subsidiary, and multiple other manufacturers and retailers. The City of Baltimore asserted public nuisance and negligence claims against the Company. The City of Baltimore action also was transferred to MDL-2924 and subsequently was remanded to the Circuit Court of Maryland. The City of Baltimore filed an amended complaint, which the defendants moved to dismiss. The Company's federal preemption motion to dismiss was granted in February 2022 and it is not currently a defendant in the case. In January 2021, the Company was served in a Proposition 65 case filed by the Center for Environmental Health ("CFEH") in the Superior Court of Alameda County, California. The plaintiff purports to bring the case on behalf of the people of California and alleges that the Company violated Proposition 65, a California law requiring manufacturers to disclose the presence of carcinogens in consumer products. The Company and other defendants filed demurrers (motions to dismiss) in the case, and on May 07, 2021 the Court granted the generic manufacturer defendants' demurrers without leave to amend the pleadings. CFEH appealed that decision and appellate briefing is completed. Oral argument took place on March 1, 2023. On March 9, 2023, the appellate court affirmed dismissal of the generic manufacturer defendants. The plaintiff sought appellate review from the California Supreme Court. On June 21, 2023, the Supreme Court of California denied plaintiff's petition for review and plaintiff's request for depublication of the appellate court's decision.

As mentioned, a large number of claimants were exited from the MDL-2924 census registry by the defendants. As a result, more than 360 plaintiffs have filed suit against the Company in California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania state courts. Generally, they allege, among other things, failure to warn, design defect and negligence. More state court filings could follow. The California cases were filed in Alameda County and will be transferred to the existing Judicial Council Coordination Proceedings ("JCCP") (which has been pending for years with respect to the brand defendants). A Master Complaint was filed in the JCCP on September 29, 2023. It does not name generics. Approximately 213 Short Form Complaints were filed in December 2023. An omnibus preemption demurrer was filed on February 23, 2024, and on April 23, 2024 the JCCP Court sustained the demurrer of the generic defendants with leave to amend. The Illinois cases have been filed in Madison, St. Clair, and Cook Counties and have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in Cook County. On August 17, 2023, the judge presiding over the consolidated state court proceedings granted the generics' motion to dismiss all claims in the Master Complaint with prejudice based on federal preemption. The Pennsylvania cases were filed in Philadelphia County and consolidated in the Philadelphia Complex Litigation Center. The Philadelphia Court granted the generic defendants' motion to dismiss based on preemption as to all claims in the Generic Long Form Complaint asserted under Pennsylvania law for design defect and failure to warn. In January 2024, five Short Form Complaints naming the Company were filed and three remain pending. Generic defendants filed preliminary objections as to the Short Form Complaints, and are awaiting plaintiffs' response. Oral argument as to the generic defendants' preliminary objections is scheduled for June 25, 2024.The New York cases were filed in New York and Suffolk Counties, and consolidated in New York County, but were voluntarily dismissed as to the generic defendants on July 21, 2023. The New Jersey cases were filed in Middlesex County, but were voluntarily dismissed as to the generic defendants on March 23, 2023.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

The Company believes that all of the aforesaid complaints and asserted claims are without merit and it denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable at this time. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements.

## Class Action under the Canadian Competition Act filed in Federal Court in Toronto, Canada

On June 3, 2020, a Class Action Statement of Claim was filed by an individual consumer in Federal Court in Toronto, Canada, against the Company's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries and 52 other generic drug companies. The Statement of Claim alleges an industry-wide, overarching conspiracy to violate Sections 45 and 46 of the Canadian Competition Act by conspiring to allocate the market, fix prices, and maintain the supply of generic drugs in Canada. The action is brought on behalf of a class of all persons, from January 1, 2012 to the present, who purchased generic drugs in the private sector. The Statement of Claim states that it seeks damages against all defendants on a joint and several basis, attorney's fees and costs of investigation and prosecution. An Amended Statement of Claim was served on the Company's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries on January 15, 2021 and added an additional 20 generic drug companies. The Amended Statement of Claim also removed the identification of defendant companies with conspiracy allegations regarding specific generic drugs and alleges a conspiracy to allocate the North America Market as to all generic drugs in Canada. A Second Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim was served on the Company's U.S. and Canadian subsidiaries on August 24, 2022 and adds an additional 10 drug companies. The Second Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim reinstituted the identification of defendant companies with conspiracy allegations regarding specific generic drugs. On June 1, 2023, Plaintiffs served and filed a Motion Record for Certification of the proposed class action. In December 2023 Plaintiffs' counsel advised that they intend to further amend their Second Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim to clarify the proposed class. The Plaintiffs' further amended claim has not yet been delivered. The certification motion hearing has been set by the court for five days in the week of May 12, 2025. The deadline for the Company's responding evidence to the certification motion has been agreed upon between the parties as July 5, 2024, subject to court approval.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements.

## United States Antitrust Multi-District Litigations

Since November 2016, the Generic Drug Price Fixing Antitrust Multi-District Litigation, MDL 2724 (the "MDL 2724") has been pending in the United States District Court in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A multi-district litigation or MDL is a U.S. legal proceeding in which all cases relating to the same subject and claims filed anywhere in the United States are sent and consolidated into one legal proceeding in a single U.S. court for purposes of all pretrial activities, such as discovery (including document production and depositions), motions and other legal proceedings. These legal proceedings are administered on a joint or consolidated basis up until trial and then, when all pretrial proceedings have been concluded, cases are sent back to the courts where they were originally filed (if not originally filed in the MDL District) for trial purposes.

All cases filed in the MDL 2724 encompass claims that certain generic drug manufacturers/sellers in the United States (and certain named individual defendants) engaged in a conspiracy, beginning approximately in the year 2009, to agree on the prices at which each generic drug would be sold, and also on the market shares and customers that each manufacturer would have for a generic drug. They include alleged violations of federal antitrust laws and of state consumer protection and antitrust laws of numerous jurisdictions, as well as claims of unjust enrichment.

As of the date of this report, there are approximately 250 plaintiffs having filed a total of 206 cases. The claims in all the cases encompass a total of over 400 generic drugs sold during a period beginning approximately in the year 2009. The Company (through its U.S. subsidiary, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc.) is named specifically as a defendant with respect to 35 generic drugs that it sold during this period of time. In addition, even though each defendant (including the Company) did not sell all the drugs encompassed by the claims, the plaintiffs in all the cases assert that there was an "overarching conspiracy" among the generic manufacturers which encompassed an agreement and understanding throughout the industry that generic manufacturers

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

would cooperate with each other on prices, customers and market shares on all generic drugs sold in the United States, and that each manufacturer would cooperate on the "fair share" conspiracy whenever it entered or sold a drug in a specific generic drug market. As a result of this alleged "overarching conspiracy" claim, the plaintiffs claim that each defendant (including the Company) is liable for not only the damages suffered with respect to the specific drugs that a defendant sold, but is also liable for all of the damages with respect to all of the drugs encompassed by the "overarching conspiracy" claim (i.e., all the drugs in the cases), whether a manufacturer defendant sold that drug or not.

The plaintiffs seek "treble" damages (i.e., three times the actual damages sustained) and injunctive relief, plus attorney's fees and costs in the litigation. The plaintiffs also allege claims for disgorgement of alleged unjust enrichment of profits earned by each defendant, including the Company, and punitive damages as a result of the alleged violations. The plaintiffs in the cases fall into the following categories:

- · The Attorneys General of 49 U.S. States, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Guam, which all allege that they were injured by the price fixing conspiracy in their general economies and that there were injuries suffered by consumers in their jurisdictions, seeking the disgorgement of improper profits on the generic drugs, and damages suffered by governmental agencies (such as government hospitals, agencies and prisons) that purchased generic drugs, encompassing a total of 129 generic drugs. The Company is named as to seven drugs. In addition, each of the plaintiffs seek to enforce their own state antitrust laws, which enable them to impose fines on a defendant in addition to seeking treble damages and disgorgement of alleged unjust enrichment from each defendant;
- · Class actions on behalf of all companies that directly purchased generic drugs from one or more of the defendants during a period beginning approximately in the year 2009 (the "Direct Purchaser Plaintiff" Class or "DPP" Class). This class action consists of all wholesaler/distributors, group purchasing organizations, and large pharmacies and retailers who purchased directly from one or more defendants. These claims encompass 148 drugs, of which the Company sold 11 drugs;
- · Class actions on behalf of all companies that indirectly purchased generic drug and resold them during a period beginning approximately in the year 2009 (the "Indirect Reseller Plaintiff" Class or "IRP" Class). This class consists of all pharmacies and retailers that purchased generic drugs from a wholesaler/distributor and resold the drugs. These claims encompass 179 generic drugs, of which the Company sold 20 drugs;
- · Class actions on behalf of all companies that were end payers for the purchase of generic drugs by consumers (the "End Payer Plaintiff Class" or "EPP" Class). This class consists of all health care plans, insurance companies and union welfare funds that paid for generic drugs purchased by their members (consumers). These claims encompass 152 generic drugs, of which the Company sold 12 drugs; and
- · Approximately 200 individual companies (which have opted out of the class actions), consisting of pharmacy retailers, health insurers, hospitals, counties and other local governmental agencies, (the "Direct Action Plaintiffs" or "DAPs") have individually filed complaints and alleged claims. These claims encompass a total of more than 400 drugs, of which the Company sold 33 drugs.

All complaints in the MDL 2724 are being simultaneously litigated together, on a consolidated basis, for all discovery and pre-trial purposes. Discovery is still proceeding. The first three cases that have been designated for the first trials in the MDL 2724 (the so-called "bellwether" cases) do not involve the Company as a defendant. These bellwether cases encompass claims by the DPPs and EPPs as to two specific drugs that were not sold by the Company and claims by the Attorney Generals as to approximately 80 topical drugs and creams that were not sold by the Company. The trial dates in the bellwether cases have not yet been scheduled, but they are not anticipated to occur until 2025. After these bellwether cases are completed, it is expected that some of the DAPs will then proceed to trial on a fourth bellwether case against some of the defendants. The DAP bellwether has not yet been defined and is not expected to be completed until 2027.

In addition to the cases filed in the MDL 2724, approximately 150 companies (consisting primarily of health insurers and health plans) have filed three praecipe of actions in the Pennsylvania Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, against

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

52 generic drug companies, including the Company, giving notice of potential, unspecified antitrust claims against the named defendants. These praecipes of actions have been stayed pending the developments and potential completion of the cases in the MDL 2724.

The Company believes that all of the aforesaid complaints and asserted claims are without merit and it denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable at this time. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements

## Civil litigation with Mezzion

On January 13, 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafil finished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and finished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the filing of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. The Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of said denial was also denied. The case is continuing in pretrial discovery.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements.

## Revlimid ® Antitrust Litigation

In 2023 and 2024, three lawsuits were filed against Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. ("DRL Inc.") and/or Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. ("DRL Ltd." and together with DRL Inc., "DRL")) in federal court in New Jersey concerning the drug product Revlimid® and generic equivalents. Litigation has been pending in that court since at least 2019 by various plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims and similar claims against Celgene Corporation ("Celgene") and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS") related to Revlimid®, In re Revlimid & Thalomid Purchaser Antitrust Litigation, C.A. No. 19-cv-07532 (D.N.J.) Starting in 2022, certain plaintiffs also filed lawsuits in this litigation against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. ("Teva") and Natco Pharma Limited ("Natco") as well. Then, in 2023, plaintiffs Mayo Clinic and LifePoint Corporate Services, General Partnership filed a complaint against DRL Inc. as well as defendants Celgene, BMS, Natco, and Teva (C.A. No. 23-cv-22321 (D.N.J.)). In a second lawsuit in 2023 (C.A. No. 23-cv-22117 (D.N.J.)), plaintiff Intermountain Health, Inc. filed a complaint against DRL Inc. and the same group of defendants Celgene, BMS, Natco, and Teva (Mayo Clinic, LifePoint Corporate Services, General Partnership, and Intermountain Health, Inc., together, the "Hospital Plaintiffs"). In a third lawsuit, filed in 2024 (24-cv-00379 (D.N.J.)), plaintiffs Walgreen Co., Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Inc., and CVS Pharmacy Inc. (together, the "Retailer Plaintiffs"), who previously had sued Celgene, BMS, Natco, and Teva, filed an additional complaint against DRL Inc. and DRL Ltd.

The allegations brought by the Hospital Plaintiffs and the Retailer Plaintiffs against DRL in these three cases are similar: they allege that the patent settlement agreement among DRL, Celgene and BMS concerning Revlimid® violated federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws by improperly delaying generic entry of Revlimid® through 2022 and then limiting generic competition of Revlimid® through 2026. The Hospital Plaintiffs' and Retailer Plaintiffs' claims against DRL Inc. and/or DRL Ltd. are also substantially similar to the claims these plaintiffs have brought against defendants Celgene, BMS, Natco, and Teva.

The lawsuits naming DRL as a defendant have been consolidated with the ongoing Revlimid-related antitrust litigation. Discovery is currently underway in the consolidated In re Revlimid action with expert discovery to follow. A trial date has not yet

been scheduled. DRL has not yet responded to the complaints and its responses are stayed pending the resolution of certain motions to dismiss filed by defendants Celgene, BMS, Natco, and Teva.

## Other matters

## Internal Investigation

The Company received an anonymous complaint in September 2020, alleging that healthcare professionals in Ukraine and potentially in other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the Company in violation of U.S. anti-corruption laws, specifically the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company disclosed the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and Securities Exchange Board of India. The Company engaged a U.S. law firm to conduct the investigation at the instruction of a committee of the Company's Board of Directors. On July 6, 2021 the Company received a subpoena from the SEC for the production of related documents, which were provided to the SEC.

The Company made presentations to the SEC and the DOJ in relation to the investigation with respect to certain countries during the previous fiscal years. The Company also made a presentation to the SEC and the DOJ in relation to its Global Compliance Framework, including the ongoing enhancement initiatives, during the year ended March 31, 2023. The Company is complying with its listing obligations as it relates to updating the regulatory agencies. While the findings from the aforesaid investigations could result in government or regulatory enforcement actions against the Company in the United States and/or foreign jurisdictions, which can lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws, the outcomes including liabilities are not reasonably ascertainable at this time.

## Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollaram and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effluents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fixed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on February 12, 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated October 30, 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee.

The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgment dated October 24, 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently filed a review petition against the judgment on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgment dated November 16, 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company filed an appeal challenging this judgment.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgment in July 2018 and directed the respondents to file their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended September 30, 2018, the respondents filed counter affidavits and the matter has now been adjourned for final hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on October 25, 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing. The Hon'ble High Court has closed the matter in June 2022, by granting liberty for the Company to take proper recourse for remedies available under the NGT Act, 2010 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.

On April 24, 2019, based upon the judgment of the NGT, Chennai dated October 24, 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued GO.Ms. No. 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded fiscal year, i.e., March 31, 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended March 31, 2019.

During the three months ended September 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated October 24, 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated April 24, 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated May 24, 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of such affected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram. The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application filed by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5% as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated August 3, 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G.O.Ms No. 24 dated April 24, 2019 and G.O.Ms No. 31 dated May 24, 2019 and basis the judgment of NGT, Chennai dated October 24, 2017 for the fiscal years 2015-2016 to 2018-2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2, CTO-3 and CTO-5 of the Company.

On November 22, 2019, The Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued an Interim Order which stayed the demand on the condition that the Company deposit ' 60 as the remediation fee for the fiscal year 2018-2019 payable in the fiscal year 2019-2020. The deposit of ' 60 was made and the Interim Order is continuing. Consequently the Hon'ble High Court has disposed of the matter with a liberty to the Company to approach the NGT, if necessary. The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the consolidated financial statements.

## Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional financial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the Company recognized an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognizing the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from April 1, 2012 to March 31, 2013.

## Indirect taxes related matters

## Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company has received various demand notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded       | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| April 2006 to March 2009          | ' 66 plus 10% penalty | The State VAT Appellate Tribunal has remanded the matter to the  assessing authority to re-compute the eligibility and penalty orders are  set-aside. The Company filed appeal against the same with the High  Court, Telangana. |
| April 2009 to March 2011          | ' 55 plus 10% penalty | The Company has filed an appeal before the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal.  The matter was remanded to the original adjudicating authority with a  direction to re-calculate the eligibility for the year ended March 31, 2010.    |
| April 2011 to March 2014          | ' 27 plus 10% penalty | The Appellate Deputy Commissioner issued an order partially in favour  of the Company                                                                                                                                            |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 51 as of 31March 2024 and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the ongoing litigation is not probable.

## Notices from Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax, India

In January 2020, the Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax, India issued notices alleging that the Company has improperly availed input tax credit of ' 307. The Company then received an order from the Additional Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax in favor of the Company's right to claim such input tax credit. Subsequently the tax authorities filed an appeal against the favorable order before the Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax (Appeals). Commissioner of Goods and Service Tax (Appeals) passed an order rejecting the Company's right to claim such input tax credit availment. The Company has filed an Appeal against such order before Hon'ble High Court of Telangana. The Company believes that it has correctly distributed and availed the input tax credit within the provisions of the applicable Act and hence no additional liability will accrue in this regard.

With reference to availment of input tax credit relating to education cess, the Company has received order with tax demand of ' 31 from the Goods and Service Tax ("GST") authorities of various states pursuant to which it has recorded a provision of ' 31 as of March 31, 2024.

In February 2022, the Company has paid under protest an amount of ' 123 towards a reversed GST charge. The Company believes that such GST amount paid is not payable and the entire amount will be refundable to the Company upon the refund claim by the Company. Further to the same the company has received the notice of DRC-01A in Feb'2024 from the DGGI authorities and the company has responded to the same and awaiting for the further hearing on same.

Other indirect tax related matters

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 463. The Company has responded to such demand notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2024.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

## 2.38 Military conflict between Russia and Ukraine

The Company considered the uncertainty relating to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine in assessing the recoverability of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. The outcome of the war is difficult to predict, and it could have an adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment. Management has considered all potential impacts of the war including adherence of global sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia and any retaliatory actions taken by Russia. For this purpose, the Company considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements.

The Company's supply chain has been impacted primarily in Russia and Ukraine, both in terms of higher freight costs and increase in the lead time by suppliers to deliver products. However, the Company has been able to service its customers without any significant shortages or disruptions. The Company based on its judgments, estimates and assumptions including sensitivity analysis, expects to fully recover the carrying amount of receivables, inventory, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. Accordingly, during the year ended March 31, 2023, the impact of this conflict on the Company's operations and financial condition was not material. The Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

## Conclusion

## Reasonable level of Assurance- BRSR 9 Core Indicators

Based on our review and procedures followed for reasonable level of assurance, DNV is of the opinion that, in all material aspects, the BRSR Core indicators (as listed in Annex I of this statement) for FY 2023-24 are reported in accordance with reporting requirements outlined in BRSR Core (Annexure I of SEBI Circular dated 12 July 2023).

## Limited Level of Assurance- BRSR Reporting Format

On the basis of the assessment undertaken, nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the disclosures do not properly adhere to the reporting requirements as per BRSR reporting guidelines (Annexure II of SEBI Circular).
