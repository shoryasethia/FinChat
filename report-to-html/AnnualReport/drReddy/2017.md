## Chairman's & Co-Chairman's Letter

## Dear Shareholder,

It is useful to start with a summary of your company's performance in FY2017.

- · Consolidated revenues were at ' 140.8 billion, which was less by almost 9% compared to the previous year.
- · Gross profi t margin was at 55.6% of consolidated revenues, or four percentage points lower than what it was in FY2016.
- · EBITDA was at ' 25.5 billion versus ' 36.3 billion in FY2016, and accounted for 18.1% of consolidated revenues.
- · Profi t before tax (PBT) was at ' 14.7 billion compared to ' 27.1 billion in the previous year.
- · Profi t after tax (PAT) was at ' 12 billion or 8.5% of revenues. It was 40% less than FY2016.

What were the reasons of this unfortunate performance? Broadly speaking, your company went through what is called a 'perfect storm' when several negative factors simultaneously came into play. Let us briefl y discuss each of these.

The fi rst was related to the US Food and Drug Administration's (USFDA's) inspections. In November 2014 and March 2015, the regulator inspected three of our plants: two chemical units that manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) at Srikakulam and Miryalaguda, and our formulations plant at Duvadda, near Visakhapatnam, which is an oncological sterile injectable facility with the capacity to manufacture certain complex generics. Based on their inspection, the USFDA sent a warning letter to your company in November 2015.

We responded with a comprehensive plan of corrective and remedial actions along with timelines.

Based on our corrective actions, the USFDA re-inspected these three plants between February 2017 and April 2017. We have received some observations from the regulator thereafter, and have subsequently submitted a detailed response. At present, we await the USFDA's views on our latest set of responses.

There is no doubt that the remedial actions triggered by the USFDA's observations is unmistakably benefi cial to Dr. Reddy's in the long run and that it has helped us to accelerate the pace of quality reforms across our plants. We have, since November 2015, signifi cantly invested in processes, automation, detailed documentation of each batch and standard operating procedures, and have further strengthened our quality management systems. We also believe that the shift in the US regulator's approach from 'what has gone wrong' to 'what can go wrong' is for the long term good of the industry. Equally, however, the warning letter put on hold the approval of several key drugs, including high value added injectables and complex generics, to the US from the last quarter of FY2016 and throughout FY2017. This pipeline blockage affected revenues, margins and profi ts. Additional costs of conducting remedial work, including the use of international consultants, also reduced profi ts.

The second factor was the intensive growth of competition in US from several other global generics players. This was on account of two reasons: new competitors launching some of our niche and high salience drugs and dramatically pushing prices down; and the signifi cant consolidation of our key US trade channels which gave the buyers greater pricing power than before. Moreover, a high value multi-year supply contract from our US manufacturing facility, expired during the year.

Third, there were signifi cant delays in USFDA approvals and the consequent launch of new products in the US. These have nothing to do with the warning letters regarding our three facilities. Instead, these are on account on several additional queries raised by the USFDA - not just to us but all global pharmaceutical companies. Added to these deferrals were intellectual property litigations on some of our complex generics products.

Fourth, as an industry, we are facing government inspired pricing pressures in emerging and even the developed markets. Regulators have become ever more vigilant of price increases taken by pharmaceutical companies. In India, for FY2017, your company's revenue growth was constrained by the notifi ed decline of prices of a large number of drugs, including your company's leading brands, in the National

<!-- image -->

We have signifi cantly invested in processes, automation, operating procedures, to strengthen our quality management systems.

We believe that there are enormous opportunities across emerging markets, and are playing actively to increase our presence through generics and biosimilars.

We have widened our European footprint from the UK and Germany to France, Italy and Spain, we expect more signifi cant growth from the continent in the years to come.

List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) issued by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA). Elsewher e, global fi rms have been subpoenaed by lawmakers over price rises. In the US, the EU, China and Japan, governments are either considering or actively implementing policies that constrain price increases. This will only increase over time as more aged people need direct and indirect healthcare support from their governments.

The fi fth has to do with what was once an excellently profi table emerging market, Venezuela.

Till two years ago, your company enjoyed a sound business in providing affordable medicine to that country. However, an increasingly severe economic crisis in Venezuela has led to the government imposing severe constraints on foreign exchange outfl ows. Those familiar with last year's annual report will know that we took a major write-down of the net monetary assets of our Venezuelan business in FY2016. Thereafter, we have consciously chosen to limit our business to supplying consignments only against remittance of funds from Venezuela. Since such repatriations are minuscule, so too is the size of our business.

Finally, our active pharmaceutical ingredients business was also impacted due to lower off-take of some key molecules.

These six factors came together; worked contemporaneously throughout FY2017; and severely affected both revenue and profi ts.

What are the bright spots? And where do we go from here?

We believe that the pricing pressures in the US market will be less severe and more calibrated in FY2018. We also have an excellent pipeline of complex generics to be introduced to the country in FY2018, and expect to do better through this effective upgrade of our portfolio mix.

We also believe that there are enormous opportunities across emerging markets, and are playing actively to increase our presence in these territories through complex generics and biosimilars.

The Russian and CIS markets are on a moderate upswing. Though threats of government-induced pricing pressure remain, we are seeing greater offtake of generics - both relatively simple and complex - and oncological biosimilars, the latter through greater hospital and institutional sales. We believe that emerging markets will again get back to double-digit growth.

Despite government induced pricing pressures on pharmaceutical products, India remains a high growth

market. In FY2017, revenues grew by 9% over the previous year. The fi rst quarter of FY2018 may witness a temporary decline in the sales due to de-stocking by trade on the implementation of Goods and Services Tax (GST). Post normalisation, we expect to grow at low double-digits in FY2018 and for the foreseeable future.

Having striven to widen our European footprint from the UK and Germany to France, Italy and Spain, we expect more signifi cant growth from the continent in the years to come.

We are particularly proud of our relatively nascent proprietary products business. The focus in FY2017 was on the commercialization of our newly launched products: Zembrace TM SymTouch TM (a 3 mg sumatriptan injection for acute migraine) and Sernivo TM (a betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% spray to treat mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis). We shall attempt to signifi cantly drive the growth of these products while introducing new products from our healthy pipeline.

Perhaps the most signifi cant aspect of the top-line crunch in FY2017 is that it forced us to carefully look at all elements of costs and administrative layers - items that inexorably build up in good times and are generally only confronted in periods of stress. We have started multiple, company-wide projects to lop off costs without affecting productivity and, in doing so, recreate a leaner and more nimble global enterprise.

No chairman of a company listed in India and the US should ever make forward-looking statements. Even so, we are tempted to believe that your company's performance in FY2018 will be better than what we saw in FY2017. Let us indeed hope that it will. We have a good of complex generics offerings and proprietary product. Our biosimilar products are gaining traction. So too are our over-the-counter portfolios in Russia and the CIS, the US and India. And the API business should to do better next year. Most importantly, the management is united in putting aside the results of FY2017 and in striving for higher growth and better profi tability in FY2018.

We are, therefore, cautiously optimistic of your company's performance in FY2018.

Thank you for your support.

With best regards,

## Accelerating Access to Good Health

Accelerating access to affordable and innovative medicines is at the core of our work at Dr. Reddy's. The belief that Good Health Can't Wait inspires us to delve deep into understanding the needs of patients around the world and do all that it take to fulfi ll them.

Even as our medicines ensure good health for millions of people around the world every day, we are aware that there are millions more, in different countries, for whom high quality, affordable medicines continue to be out of reach. We realize that accelerating access to good health requires acting with alacrity on several fronts - developing products where affordable alternatives don't exist, working with all stakeholders in the healthcare systems

across different countries to enable market access, manufacturing medicines of the highest quality in full adherence to the best global manufacturing practices, and ensuring their availability at all times through a robust, effi cient and seamless supply chain.

We regard the good health of our patients as our responsibility and are committed to go the extra mile to ensure that they always have access to the medicines they need. In the following pages we share a few stories that illustrate our commitment to patients and our partners in the accelerated journey to good health.

Medicines work only when they are taken in the right dosage at the right time. And that is easier said than done. Dr. Reddy's deployed human-centred design thinking to help treatment become more effective, not just through better medicines, but through intelligent packaging.

At Dr. Reddy's, we do not see ourselves as a mere manufacturer of medicines. The concept of care and its proper delivery is as important to us as the quality of our drugs. We think beyond the molecule to ensure that we are empathetic to our patients' needs by experiencing their issues fi rst hand.

Our Purple Health initiative was undertaken to do exactly this improve the patients experience by identifying apparently minor issues that were a hindrance to the adherence or effi cacy of a treatment.

## Getting to the Heart of the Matter

We engaged with multiple stakeholders across India patients, doctors and pharmacies in order to get insights into what might be preventing medicines from being fully effective. Our research showed that irregular and incorrect intake of medicines resulted in suboptimal outcomes. And, it was a universal phenomenon.

Patients either forgot to take their medicines on time, or were not aware of the right dosage, or found information on packs diffi cult to comprehend.

Our research also indicated that across the pharmaceutical industry, current packaging material and packaging practices further compounded the issue, particularly because it was the primary touch point for patients. For instance, once the blister pack was ruptured, dosage information or other key data became illegible. Or, the number of pills on a strip or the amount of syrup in a bottle were not designed for the full course of the treatment, resulting in either a shortfall or surplus of dosage.

This was a cause for concern, because irregular or incorrect medicine usage can cause unintended, but potentially serious repercussions for patients.

## Designing Better Dosages

Dr. Reddy's partnered with global design and innovation consultants IDEO to fi nd solutions to such seemingly trivial problems that had major implications. We used 'human-centred design' as our guiding principle, and recognised that a unique approach was essential to improve and regularise medicine intake by patients. Investing in an entirely different kind of R&D, we initiated a reimagined packaging scheme to drive change and motivate patients. We devised and prototyped a unique blister packaging for products such as Reclimet-XR™, Reclimet™, Bilefi x™, Glimy™, Glimy M™, Metsmall™, Atocor™, Ketorol DT™ and Alfoo™.

A comprehensive solution was the fi nal outcome of this exercise. Some of the key recommendations included:

<!-- image -->

## STUB EXTENSIONS

for printing brand name, expiry date, and MRP. This ensures that critical information is available throughout the course, irrespective of the level of consumption from the pack.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

## COLOR-CODED STUBS

for different strengths so both pharmacists and patients can easily identify the right dosage.

## RE-DESIGNED MEASURING CUPS

which are sturdy, convenient to hold, with wider lips and slightly rounded bottoms, for easier cleaning.

<!-- image -->

## A DOSING MATRIX

which allows the doctor's prescription to be recorded on the pack itself. This obviates the need to keep referring to the prescription for correct dosage information.

<!-- image -->

## DRIP-FREE BOTTLES

ensure that syrups don't leave sticky deposits on the sides and necks of bottles while being poured. This is both hygienic and allows the cap to be screwed on properly.

<!-- image -->

## BI-MONTHLY DOSAGE PACKS

with 14 pills so that patients can transition from a monthly to weekly (or fortnightly) buying and consumption pattern, which is easier to adhere to.

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

Accelerating Access to Good Health

While incidences of cancer are increasing at a rapid rate across the world, access to medicines that can cure the disease is not keeping pace. Dr. Reddy's established a presence in Colombia, a country with high cancer incidence to serve the market with affordable oncology products.

For Dr. Reddy's the promise of serving unmet patient needs transcends borders. Our business is driven by a strategy to identify and enter markets where affordable healthcare is a dire need, and yet existing availability is insuffi cient. Colombia is one such market. The South American nation has an ageing population and an increasing prevalence of cancer.

Existing channels of affordable medicines to treat the disease were simply not adequate to meet the need. This situation perfectly aligned with our promise of addressing unmet patient needs and we entered the institutional business segment, with a primary focus on oncology.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

## Building a Pathway to Access

We moved swiftly. Beginning with preliminary seeding in November 2014, we completed all activities in under 2 years, for a for mal launch in October 2016. This included portfolio fi nalisation, plant GMP approvals, approval of 5+ products, recruiting local sales and marketing teams, and setting up of operations systems such as Human Resources, Customer Relationship Management, Regulatory and Compliance.

The response fr om doctors, the Ministry of Health, insurance fi rms and pharmacists was encouraging.

An interesting statistic emerged from our experience. When affordable generics are introduced in an underserved market, the number of patients receiving quality medication goes up by 3-4 times. This is, in a sense, our greatest reward because it allows us to bring affordable treatment to patients who needed it.

This success has motivated us to bring other complex institutional products and biosimilars to Colombia, either from our own portfolio or from our strategic partners.

## Building on Success

The Colombian establishment represented a signifi cant fi rst for us at Dr. Reddy's.

It was our maiden new market entry with a comprehensive set-up, including putting in place our own sales and marketing teams.

The operating environment - a signifi cant size, high quality doctors, progressive regulatory regime.

The portfolio that we created, further accelerated access to good health for patients in the region.

At Dr. Reddy's, our business is all about helping patients lead healthier lives. The need for medicines is not a predictable one, in many cases. When an ailing patient in the US needed our help, we pulled out all stops to fulfi l that need and helped save a life, signifi cant challenges notwithstanding.

Access to good health goes beyond making and marketing medicines. It is about addressing every need with empathy and dynamism, even if it means coordinating across continents to help a single patient. Staying true to our values, and working as a team are crucial aspects of making this happen.

In 2016, Dr. Reddy's acquired 'E7777', a IL-2-diphtheria toxin-fusion protein drug meant to treat certain rare forms of skin cancer, from a Japanese fi rm - Eisai. Under the agreement, we had the rights to develop, manufacture and commercialise E7777 in the US and other countries (except Asia). However, this was to come in force, once the development (both Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) and Clinical) was complete and it was approved by the regulator for the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) indication. The onus of getting the regulatory approval and supply for clinical trials was with Eisai.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW

<!-- image -->

## A Call to Duty

On October 31, 2016, one of the investigators wrote in with an urgent request. She wanted the E7777 medication for one of her patients, who was in a critical stage of the disease. The only problem, the patient did not qualify to receive the drug under the on-going trial because of clinical condition. The investigator insisted that administering E7777 was necessary to control disease progression and give the patient any meaningful hope of a salvage transplant.

## Coordinated Compassion

Before making a commitment to the concerned medical practitioner, we identifi ed, jointly with Eisai, all the steps needed to fulfi l this request.

Next, we inventoried the clinical trial material (CTM) to ensure that we had suffi cient surplus vials of the product to provide a complete therapy cycle, and some additional for contingencies as well. We then requested the investigator to obtain approval from the Stanford IRB and fi le an emergency individual patient Investigation New Drug (IND) with the FDA, which would allow us to administer E7777 for extended use.

Our legal team, worked relentlessly to develop and execute necessary agreement between Dr. Reddy's and the organisation that the medical practitioner represented.

Saving lives is a Beautiful

## Experience

6 weeks later we received an update from the investigator that the patient was doing well. This is an excellent outcome considering that all other available treatment options had been exhausted.

Intent, teamwork and swift action ensured that the entire process was completed with due regulatory compliance in just two weeks from the day of request. The cohesiveness and alacrity with which all involved (and there were quite a few!) acted, is a validation of our belief, Good Health Can't Wait. It should not have to.

Eisai was in control of the drug supply of E7777 for clinical studies and agreed to support this request. However, since E7777 was now a Dr. Reddy's product, they thought it appropriate that we administer the drug for this case. Therefore, its extended use could only be administered by us.

This meant that we had to act quickly on a myriad of activities, before being able to reach the medication to the patient.

Finally, we roped in Catalent, the global drug delivery fi rm, to re-label the required number of vials and to ship them directly to the patient's location. Catelent told us that it would take 30 days to ship.

Our team was determined to make this happen, and collaborated closely with Eisai and Catalent to expedite the re-labelling and release for shipment. The shipment reached two days ahead of the deadline faced by the investigator, who dosed the patient immediately.

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

Accelerating Access to Good Health

Across the world, there is evidence of the fact that the entry of a low-cost option of an expensive medicine provides a signifi cant fi llip to access of the medicine. This spurt in usage does not indicate an increased incidence of the disease, but rather the stark reality that people who otherwise cannot afford the medicine now can have access to treatment. Reditux™, the Dr. Reddy's brand of Rituximab has been a shining example of this over its ten year journey.

Developing and providing affordable options for expensive therapies that require deep scientifi c capabilities is at the core of our purpose. In 2007, Dr. Reddy's had developed 'Reditux™', the world's fi rst biosimilar of the drug 'Rituximab'used to treat certain autoimmune diseases and types of cancer.In India, originator brand of Rituximab was launched in 2002 at a price beyond the reach of most patients suffering from Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL). Dr. Reddy's launched Reditux™ in 2007, at a price signifi cantly lower than the originator rituximab price. Over the last 10 years, Reditux™ has helped increase patient access to Rituximab 10-fold and made its mark across the globe. .

<!-- image -->

## Increasing access in other markets

Reditux™ has benefi tted over 75,000 patients spread across 17 countries.Until 2008, in Peru, despite government health insurance coverage, a signifi cant proportion of eligible NHL patients could not get access to Rituximab because of high therapy costs. Since its launch in Peru in 2009, it is estimated that Reditux™ has helped more than 8,000 patients obtain access to rituximab therapy, helping the government save ~USD 7 million cumulatively and signifi cantly easing the burden on the country's healthcare system.

Reditux™ was launched in Sri Lanka in 2013 and within just a year of the launch, patient's access to Rituximab has more than doubled, with almost 100% of patients diagnosed with NHL receiving Reditux™ as part of their treatment. In Vietnam, over the last four years since its launch, the usage of the drug has expanded signifi cantly from 300 patients in 2011 to 1,530 patients in 2016. Cumulatively 2,000 patients were treated with Reditux™and an additional 670 patient could get access to Rituximab treatment by virtue of the availability of Reditux™. It has helped national health insurance to save US$ 6 mn.

## Patient programmes to ensure affordability$^{A DECADE OF LEADERSHIP}$

At Dr. Reddy's being dynamic is always complimented with being empathetic. We did not stop at just being pioneers of bringing in affordability to the treatment of NHL, we also reached out to patients who still needed a helping hand and met them halfway. In 2006 we launched Sparsh, a program designed to reach out to cancer patients with fi nancial support, in India. Through this program, patients are provided with free doses of Reditux™ as well as other Oncology products. Oncologists are empowered to decide the extent of support to be provided to patients. Based on the oncologists' recommendation

either 2 or 3 doses are provided for free in a 6 cycle chemotherapy regime enabling them to complete the treatment.

Just to illustrate, a treatment that would typically cost a patient about ' 1.5 - 2 lakhs could come down by more than half the amount based on the doctor's judgment. Through tie-ups with service providers, we ensure that the free doses are delivered directly to patients even in tier II and III cities. More than 15,000 patients have been provided assistance under Sparsh with a cumulative value of ' 60 crores, since the inception of the program.

## Beyond access: Early diagnosis to manage the disease burden

Early diagnosis can lead to better outcomes for patients and signifi cant savings in the overall cost of treatment. We are therefore investing efforts in the area of early diagnosis by through several initiatives.

We partnered with a leading diagnostic lab to provide access to interior parts of the country to improve and confi rm diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and thereby reduce time between diagnosis and treatment. We conduct several programs spread awareness about early warning signs of cancer by partnering with leading oncologists of the country. We partnered with the Indian Cooperative Oncology Network to focus on continuing medical education (CMEs) for doctors across India, benefi ting over 17,000 GPs and other physicians till date. We have also been able to roll out an oncology training program ratifi ed by the government for all the 336 medical colleges of India.

## PRINCIPLE 1

- 1. Does the policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption cover only the company? Yes/No. Does it extend to the group/joint ventures/suppliers/contractors/ NGOs/others?

## ETHICS, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Yes. The policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption extends beyond our company employees, both whole-time and independent directors, covers the subsidiaries and affi liates of the group. While contracts with our suppliers, contractors and business partners include adherence to our principles concerning ethics, there is a separate code of conduct required to be adhered to by our suppliers and service providers.

- 2. How many stakeholder complaints have been received in the past fi nancial year and what percentage was satisfactorily resolved by the management? if so, provide details thereof, in about 50 words or so.

We did not receive any signifi cant stakeholder complaints in the last fi nancial year.

The company has a hotline for whistle blowing and concern receiving. The concerns received are dealt with according to the company's ombudsperson policy. We did not receive any signifi cant complaint from any external stakeholder in the last fi nancial year.

## PRINCIPLE 2

- 1. List up to 3 of your products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/or opportunities.

## PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY

- a. 'Flozins' - Canaglifl ozin and Dapaglifl ozin
- c. Sustainable packaging initiative for Omeprazole, Atorvastatin, Olanzapine
- b. Sildenafi l
- 2. For each such product, provide the following details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of product (optional):
- b. Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) has been achieved since the previous year
- a. Reduction during sourcing/ production/ distribution achieved since the previous year throughout the value chain

The specifi c features of the above mentioned products are detailed below:

- i. 'Flozins' - Canaglifl ozin and Dapaglifl ozin
- Flow chemistry for cryogenic reactions in Dapaglifl ozin/ Canaglifl ozin: A fl ow chemistry module has been developed and was installed in April-May, 2017 in one of our manufacturing unit. The project is in the implementation phase.

With the new process fl ow, the potential savings in energy is estimated to be ' 3,224/KG of product manufactured and in raw materials it is estimated to be ' 14,768/KG of product manufactured.

## ii. Sildenafi l

In the commercial manufacturing process of Sildenafi l, we have adopted the 1st principle of green chemistry which outlines 'prevention of waste generation'.

Improvements:

- 10 solvents reduced to just 4 solvents in the commercial route
- 89% solvent waste reduction achieved in the current commercial route
- Eliminated the use of a toxic and highly volatile solvent during the synthesis process
- iii. Sustainable packaging initiative for Omeprazole, Atorvastatin, Olanzapine etc.

Presently 80% of Dr. Reddy's procurements are from domestic producers and 20% from international producers.

- We have replaced the use of plastic drums with the use of paper fi bre drums for Omeprazole Mg capsules OTC (US market) resulting in the reduction of approximately 490 tonnes of CO$\_{2 }$emission per annum.
- We have introduced electronic version of the medication guide thus eliminating the need for a physical copy of the medication guide for Atorvastatin tablets, Omeprazole capsules, Olanzapine (US market), and resulting in saving of approximately 250 tons of paper per annum.
- The outer carton for Omeprazole capsules, Ketorolol tablets, Cetrine tablets, Nise tablets, Ibuclin tablets and Novigan tablets have been removed for the Emerging Markets thereby eliminating the use of wooden boards.
- Cubic utilization of containers by increasing the load ability for Omeprazole capsules OTC-US and Olanzepine-China resulting in a 10-20% reduction in export shipment containers by sea leading to fuel savings and a smaller CO$\_{2}$ footprint reduction.
- 3. Does the company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing (including transportation)? If yes, what percentage of your inputs was

## sourced sustainably? Also, provide details thereof, in about 50 words or so.

Yes, Dr. Reddy's has a well defi ned and documented 'supplier code of conduct' addressing all sustainable sourcing elements like ethics, labor & human rights, wages & benefi ts, health & safety, environment, management system including bribery and corruption.

Dedicated resources are involved in capacity building & sharing best practices among all strategic business partners (total number: 450). Alternative vendors are being developed where single vendors are considered critical for business continuity.

- 4. Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services from local & small producers, including communities surrounding their place of work? If yes, what steps have been taken to improve the capacity and capability of local and small vendors?

Yes, Dr. Reddy's has procedures in place to procure goods and services from local and small producers.

Presently 80% of Dr. Reddy's procurements are from domestic producers and 20% from international producers.

Dedicated resources have been assigned the job of improving the capacity and capabilities of local producers. The following are some of the initiatives:

- Mandatory supplier trainings for new vendors;
- Sharing good practices via audits and workshops;
- Relooked into packaging design to reduce carbon footprint; and
- Inculcating a culture of resource conservation among local & small producers with regard to improved solvent recovery effi ciencies and eliminating the usage of hazardous solvents like methylene di chloride.
- 5. Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and wastes? If yes, what is the

## percentage of recycled products and waste

We have ambitiously set a target to achieve zero solid waste to landfi ll by the end of 2020. For the same we have taken a few initiatives to reuse/ recycle waste.

Dr. Reddy's generated 17,300 tonnes of hazardous waste during this reporting period. Out of the total hazardous waste generated 76% of the waste, which has higher calorifi c value is used as auxiliary fuel in cement industries eliminating offsite incineration. We have initiated disposal of ETP sludge to cement industries, this year we have disposed 1,980 MT of ETP sludge to cement industries for co processing.

A few of our units, we have started sending the solid inorganic waste of low calorifi c value for co-processing by treating it before introducing to the calciner. In order to burn this solid inorganic waste effi ciently, it is blended with high calorifi c value waste to achieve a uniform calorifi c value of 2,500 kilocalories in the preprocessing units. With this initiative, we have been able to send 3,920 MT of low calorifi c value waste for co-processing.

During this reporting period, nearly 70 MT of pure potassium salt was segregated from process and upcycled into potassium based micro nutrients, which are being used for horticulture crops like palm oil and sugar cane.

Efforts are on at other locations also to segregate and upcycle pure salts from the process.

First, the US market witnessed signifi cant price erosion in some of our high value products on account of two factors: (a) new competitors also launching these drugs and pushing prices down, and (b) major consolidation of our key customers and channels which gave the buyers greater pricing power. In addition, a high value multi-year supply contract expired during the year.
- 2. Second, there were signifi cant delays in the approval and launch of new products in the US market, mainly due to additional queries raised by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) coupled with intellectual property (IP) litigations on some of our complex generics products. Moreover, some launches of key molecules such as Esomeprazole, Imatinib, some injectables as well as certain APIs were

also delayed due to three of our plants being issued an USFDA warning letter in November, 2015.

- 3. Third, to some extent, our India business was affected by Government imposed drug price regulations that covered some of our products.
- 4. Given the serious political, economic and currency crisis in Venezuela, we consciously chose to limit our business to only supplying consignments against remittance of funds from the country. Since such repatriation was minuscule, so too was the size of our business.
- 5. The API business was also impacted due to lower off-take of some key molecules.

## A SNAPSHOT OF PERFORMANCE GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

- Revenue from North America Generics was ' 63.6 billion, a fall of 16% versus FY2016. This was primarily due to delay in approvals from USFDA coupled with launch delays from our three plants that received the USFDA warning letter in November, 2015, increased competition in key

molecules such as Valganciclovir, Decitabine and Azacitidine resulting in greater price erosions and the loss of business from McNeil Consumer Healthcare which affected the revenue of our Shreveport facility in Louisiana.

Even so, in FY2017 Dr. Reddy's launched 10 products, the major ones being Omeprazole Sodium Bicarbonate, Nitroglycerin SLT and Paricalcitol injection. The year also saw 26 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) being fi led. Cumulatively, 101 generic fi lings - 99 ANDAs and two NDAs under 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway defi ned under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetics Act -are currently awaiting approval from the USFDA. Of the 99 ANDAs, 62 are Para IVs. The company believes that 21 of these are potentially in the 'First to File' status.

- Revenue from India stood at ' 23.1 billion , registering a growth of 9%. However, as mentioned earlier, growth during the year was partially impacted by the notifi ed decline of prices of certain drugs in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) issued by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA).
- Revenue from Emerging Markets was ' 21.1 billion, a decline of 11% versus FY2016. Revenue from Russia grew by 9% year-on-year to reach ' 11.5 billion, thanks to the improving macroeconomic climate and stability of the currency during the year. In roubles, the growth was 8%. Despite this growth, the Russian business is yet to reach its earlier peak. CIS markets including Romania grew by 4%. This was on account of higher off-take in Ukraine and Romania, but was partly offset by the devaluation of the Ukrainian hryvnia. Revenue from the rest of the Emerging Markets declined by 38%, largely due to severely constrained operations in Venezuela.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

- Revenue from PSAI stood at ' 21.3 billion, decline of 5% on a yearon-year basis. During the year, 82 drug master fi les (DMFs) were fi led globally. This included nine in the US, fi ve in the Europe and 68 in the other markets. The cumulative number of DMF fi lings as on 31 March 2017 was 754.

## GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET OUTLOOK

Between now and 2021, the global pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow revenues by between 4% and 7% and clock nearly US$ 1.5 trillion. That will be an increase of US$ 370 billion from the estimated spending level of 2016. A somewhat lower growth rate compared to what was witnessed in 2014 and 2015 is because these two years saw an unprecedented global surge in new hepatitis and cancer drugs. The US will continue to be the world's largest pharmaceutical market.

As it is the case today, overall revenue growth will be powered by newer medicines in developed markets and signifi cantly increased volume in the Emerging (or 'pharmerging') Markets. Faced with a growing population of the aged, developed countries will continue to offset increased costs from new medicines with the use of generics coupled with greater focus on pricing and access measures. Pharmerging markets will drive growth by trying to enhance the access of medicine across the population. These countries will comprise nine of the top 20 markets of the world. And thanks to its burgeoning volumes, China will be the clear number two after the US.

The new medicines which are expected to drive growth will be largely in the nature of 'specialty' products. Over the past decade, the share of specialty medicines has increased from 20% in 2006 to 30% in 2016, and is expected to exceed 35% by 2021. These drugs address signifi cant unmet needs in cancer, autoimmune diseases, metabolic disorder, nervous system dysfunction and others. Specialty medicines will approach half the pharmaceutical spend in the US and the EU4 (France, Germany, Italy and Spain) plus Great Britain.

## OUTLOOK FOR THE US

For most large Indian generics pharmaceutical companies, the US

<!-- image -->

accounts for anywhere between 40% to 60% of consolidated revenues. Hence, it is germane to discuss the structure of the US generics industry and some key developments. These are:

- Patent cliff and the opportunity landscape Over the next couple of years, branded drugs approximatly having a value of US$ 65 billion will go off patent. To be sure, the offpatent opportunity value is reducing; however, this does not imply that the opportunity landscape is shrinking. There are many specialty complex generics products where there are relatively few regulatory hurdles. If companies can successfully develop such generic versions to the satisfaction of the USFDA, there exists attractive opportunities. Relatively recent examples of such medicines are the generic versions of Arixtra®, EpiPen® and Copaxone®, among others. To differentiate and remain relevant, the generics participants need to create a meaningful and robust pipeline, with a very strong regulatory backbone. Equally, it needs to be stated that a steady infl ux of generics companies, both Indian and international, has led to an unprecedented increase in competition and consequentially accelerated price erosions. In recent years this price competition has been accentuated by systematic consolidation of the distribution channels in the US.
- The US pharmaceutical market will grow from US$ 462 billion in 2016 to between US$ 645 billion and US$ 675 billion in 2021.
- Product profi le and related development cost To achieve steady and profi table growth, companies must seriously and consistently innovate to develop complex molecules, new delivery platforms, drug device combinations and the like. With an increase in product complexity, R&D spend per molecule and the time required

to establish bio-equivalence have both risen. To give an example, the product development cost for a complex generic now exceeds US$ 5 million, compared to around US$ 1 million for a simple oral solid fi nished dosage form. Developmental spends on inhalations, complex injectables and biosimilar products are much higher. Major Indian pharmaceutical companies have increased R&D spend over the past fi ve years, both in absolute and percentage terms. While such absolute spends are lower than international generics majors like Actavis, Mylan and Teva, some Indian pharmaceutical companies, including Dr. Reddy's, spend higher in terms of percentage of sales. All else being equal, such higher R&D efforts bode well for

further entry of higher value complex generics, Proprietary Products and biosimilars from India to the US. A requirement for getting this strategy to succeed is that the USFDA accelerates the process of granting approvals for such complex products.

- USFDA approvals for ANDA fi lings Given the rapidly expanding base of generics companies seeking the US market, there was a need for the USFDA to augment their resource base to facilitate faster approvals. Under the Generics Drug User Fee Act (Series 1), popularly called GDUFA1, the USFDA collected fees from all participant companies to augment resources and set up a structured process of approving the ANDA applications. For the simple and not-so-complex molecules, companies have started getting timely responses including approvals.

Product development cost for a complex generic

However, complex molecules are yet to see such an increase in the response rate. Indeed, there has been a notable spike in the refuse to receive (RTR) and complete response letters (CRL). Although these are still early days, Scott Gottlieb, the new USFDA commissioner under the Trump administration, has argued in favor of defi ning a more effi cacious path for the approval of complex generic drugs. It remains to be seen how the new GDUFA2 will perform in bridging this gap.

- Sustainable commercial footprint Launching a pharmaceutical product and securing a decent sustainable market share depend upon (a) competition, (b) consolidated buying consortiums and (c) the possibly of government oversight
- Sustainable manufacturing footprint Over the last few years, the USFDA has been following a more stringent regulatory regime based on a rigorous risk-based audit methodology for the approval of manufacturing sites. This has led to an industry-wide increase in the USFDA issuing form 483s with subsequent warning letters and, on occasions, with import alerts. The regulator's expectations have increased regarding what constitutes proper documentation and in avoiding potentially 'what can go wrong' in manufacturing and quality processes - occasionally going even beyond the good manufacturing practice (GMP) requirements. We in Dr. Reddy's welcome this because, at the end of it all, there is a clear message for lifting quality and manufacturing processes to a new scale, as these should be for any global pharmaceutical major.

Large pharma companies are increasingly keen to share their risks, pool R&D resources and enhance capabilities for enhanced research and development productivity.

regarding generics pricing. For relatively simple products, there is very high competition which, coupled with rising bargaining power from an increasingly consolidated buying consortium, has resulted in a pace of price erosion that is faster than ever before. For complex drugs, realizations and sustainability of revenue stream are comparatively better. Recently, however, due to successive and almost astronomical price increases in EpiPen®, there has been considerable debate in the US over the price increases taken by select generics companies and possible controls and oversight. In the absence of a unifi ed political view on this matter, the chance of price controls in the near to medium term is low. However, the risk exists.

- Others The Trump administration has signaled its desire to bring about wide-ranging changes in taxes and trade. While the details are still unclear, point of focus seems to be a destination-based border-adjustable international corporate consumption tax (or DBT). It seems unlikely that such a DBT will be introduced given that it will contravene the WTO rules and result in a likely disruption to supplies.

## OTHER GLOBAL TRENDS

- Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are here to stay M&As continue to be one of the pharmaceutical sector's mainstay growth strategies. Consolidation becomes imminent in the face of pricing pressures; to strengthen existing product portfolios; to replenish pipelines depleted by patent expiry; to spread or deepen capabilities in priority areas; to enter new markets; and to acquire innovative technologies to

- leverage current assets or generate cost-saving synergies. In the process, increasingly larger deals are coming into play and pharma companies are digging deeper into their pock ets to fi nance M&A.
- Digital pharma In the recent past, we have witnessed some highprofi le collaborations between information technology giants and major pharmaceutical companies. As examples, Google and its parent company Alphabet formed partnerships with GSK and Sanofi , while IBM has allied with Teva, Celgene and Quest Diagnostics. These collaborations are aimed to harness new and developing technologies to supercharge R&D, help create new personalized diagnostic tools using big data and IT-driven pathways, construct more intelligent pharmacovigilance and the like. IT will continue to streamline manufacturing costs and afford options that allow for cheaper, personalized, designedintensive variations to accommodate everything from a small-batch contribution of a drug for a clinical trial to mass quantities of drugs for chronic conditions. Looking forward, these IT-pharma joint deals will rapidly become the norm.
- Collaborations to continue in the R&D space - The once low-hanging fruits for creating drug blockbusters are gone and R&D costs are on the rise. Large pharma companies are increasingly keen to share their risks, pool R&D resources and enhance capabilities for enhanced research and development productivity.
- A 3D future The next step of using technology to create personalized medicine will be the fabrication of complex specialty drugs through 3D printing of living tissues. 3D printing is a type of additive manufacturing and is a process that creates a three-dimensional object by building successive layers of raw material. Each new layer is attached to the previous one until the object is complete. The fl exibility of 3D printing allows designers to make changes easily; and it enables manufacturers to create patient-specifi c devices matched

- to a person's anatomy as well as those with very complex internal structures. These capabilities have created major interest in 3D printing of medical devices. Recognizing this, the USFDA has developed a draft guidance document that outlines the regulator's initial thoughts on the matter, especially technical considerations specifi c to devices that are expected to be manufactured via 3D printing. (1)
- a) President Trump mentioning the need to create a bidding procedure to handle escalating drug prices;
- Higher regulatory scrutiny on pricing -With increased fi nancial pressure on governments to reduce their healthcare burden, price squeeze will be a widespread factor. Regulators have become increasingly vigilant of price increases taken by fi rms - a matter that recently came to international attention with the huge EpiPen® price hikes in the US. Many global fi rms have been subpoenaed by law makers over price increases. Reforms are being implemented, drafted or fl oated by various nations as to how pricing can be constrained to mitigate the stress on healthcare costs. To give some examples:
- b) The EU council recommending greater cross-border collaboration on pharmaceutical pricing, including joint horizon scanning, proactive sharing of pricing information and joint price negotiations across 'coalitions' of member states;
- c) China stating that for the period 2016-20 the industry will witness increasing control on pharmaceutical pricing; and

- d) The Japanese government announcing in December, 2016 plans to supplement the biennial price revision process with annual price reviews in the off-years.

In response, some pharma majors have pledged to limit price hikes to single digits, stop unfair practices like incentivizing doctors to promote their products and provide increased assurance on quality and safety of their products. This new attitude is increasingly becoming the expected standard. And with the big players going on record with these commitments, the pressure is on their rivals to follow suit.

- Patient centricity Thanks to the vast resource of information on drugs available online, today's modern patient is far better informed about the medicines they are being prescribed than their previous generation. Pharma companies have to react to this new reality and realize the centrality of patient experience. For instance, Sanofi took steps to this end in 2015 by creating a new role of the chief patient offi cer and introducing a three-pillar strategy for patient centricity based on input and understanding, solutions and outcomes, and culture and community. Patient-centric clinical trials have been a hot topic since 2016, with organizations like the European Union Patients' Academy for Therapeutic Innovation (EUPATI) advocating greater patient involvement in the R&D process, including the planning of clinical trials. Giving patients an active role in trial design makes a great deal of sense. It should also help boost patient recruitment, reduce clinical trial costs and ultimately expedite the process of going to market.
- Increased importance of Emerging Markets This trend has grown steadily in recent years and will continue to do so. Pharmerging markets already account for a third of global pharmaceutical revenues. This share will continue to increase over the next decade.

Number of cancer cases expected to increase by 2030

- Rapid urbanization and an ageing population It is estimated that by 2050 more than two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities. While the benefi ts of organized and effi cient cities are well understood, rapid and unplanned urbanization invariably leads to unmanageable population densities, poverty of a growing under-class and the lack of infrastructure - which foster conditions for higher incidence of infections especially communicable and epidemiological diseases. (2) That will create an increasing government demand for affordable anti-infective medicine and related prophylactics. Between 2015 and 2030, the global population of 60 years and above is projected to grow by 56% to reach an estimated 1.4 billion; and by 2050 this will be more than double to touch 2.1 billion. Ageing population is associated with higher healthcare spending - due to higher incidences of cancer, dementia, Parkinson's disease and heart-related disorders. To give an example, only
- Rising income levels and changing lifestyles The middle class has been growing rapidly in Emerging Markets. Such families possess greater disposable income and expect better healthcare solutions. In India, for instance, successive quinquennial rounds of the national sample survey on consumer expenditure show children's education and healthcare to be items that have the highest growth in per capita spends. Thus, there is a rapidly growing demand for affordable pharmaceutical solutions. In addition, changing lifestyles have led to unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, less sleep and strains of the kind that have not been seen before. These have resulted in higher obesity rates, diabetes, poor digestion, cardiovascular problems, hallucinations, breathing diffi culties, back and neck troubles and other ailments. Such chronic lifestyle diseases have created a demand for health supplements, vitamins and minerals and signifi cantly greater dependence on medications.
- on account of ageing the number of cancer cases is expected to increase to 17 million by 2020 and 27 million by 2030. Healthcare systems will need to prepare for increasing incidences of chronic conditions within progressively older populations, with a focus on providing preventive versus reactive care.
- Immuno-oncology drugs The oncology landscape is evolving rapidly as scientifi c advances bring treatment options to an expanded number of patients. Regulatory pathways, diagnostic and treatment infrastructure and fi nancing mechanisms are required to gear up to this shift to meet the needs of populations. New treatment options have become available in the last fi ve years and the surge of innovation is expected to continue due to a robust pipeline of drugs in clinical development by a large and diverse group of pharmaceutical companies.

## As examples:

- The impact of these new medicines on patient care is exemplifi ed by the case of the two PD-1 immuno-oncology drugs, whose rapid uptake refl ects their remarkable clinical profi le and successive expansion of indications.
- Over 20 tumor types are being treated with one or more of 70 new cancer treatments that have been launched over the past fi ve years.

There is a signifi cant scope in increasing the accessibility of such immuno-oncology drugs. Only six countries in the world have more than half of the recently launched drugs available for patients and even less are reimbursed under public insurance programs. The outlook is extremely positive in this space with a robust development pipeline and signifi cant scope for widespread reach to the patient population.

- Bump up for biosimilars Biosimilars are inevitable, particularly in emerging countries but also in developed nations including the US. Simply put, biosimilars are more than therapeutic novelties. These are necessities due to the projected saving for cash-strapped health systems in the US and Europe over the next fi ve years. It is expected that approximately US$ 27 billion to US$ 58 billion of biological products would go off-patent in the US. Biosimilars are expected to have a signifi cant impact on spending over the next fi ve years: there are anywhere between 25 and 35 such molecules in development and a large percentage of them can be expected to reach the US market by 2021 subject to regulatory review and litigation. Convergence of regulatory standards is still too slow. But a bright spot is the national regulators' increasing acceptance of data extrapolation, which allows a biosimilar to be approved for multiple indications without undergoing additional clinical testing. However, stakeholder education and greater outreach are needed.

In sum, the global pharmaceutical industry is at an interesting juncture where it has to address certain inherent challenges to ride the wave of signifi cant future opportunities. To cope with the ever changing business regime, companies are re-evaluating their existing business models in their attempt to establish superior variants. These are aimed at portfolio enhancement, creation of more complex products, capability augmentation, entering new regions, targeting cost leadership and establishing lean structures. The innovative and resilient fi rms are expected to come out well addressing the concerns and fi nding avenues for growth. In general, there is cause for well calibrated optimism.

- Launched Omeprazole and Sodium Bicarbonate capsules, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Zegerid®, which is used for the treatment of heartburn and other symptoms of gastroesophageal refl ux disease.
- Launched Nitroglycerin sub-lingual tablets of various strengths, a therapeutic generic equivalent of Nitrostat® which is used to treat or prevent angina.
- Gained signifi cant market share in certain products like Esomeprazole DR and our OTC nicotine patch, Habitrol®.
- Signifi cantly stepped up remediation efforts arising out the USFDA warning letter and have de-risked for near term major launches by listing alternative sites.
- Successfully managed key accounts and fended off signifi cant competitive pressures in the injectable portfolio. We have been able to largely preserve the volume market share, although there has been signifi cant price erosion.
- Filed 26 new ANDAs during the year, comprising some key complex products across different dosage forms.
- Acquired six well known OTC brands in cough, cold, pain and dermatological categories from Ducere Pharma.
- Acquired eight ANDAs from Teva/ Allergan across various dosage forms for US$ 350 million. We believe these will be decent contributors to growth in the medium term. We launched the fi rst product Vytorin in April, 2017 and are working towards product commercialization of the remaining seven ANDAs.
- Entered into a strategic collaboration with Gland Pharma to market and distribute a diverse portfolio of eight injectable ANDAs in the US market. The combined sales of the branded and generic versions of these products in the US market was approximately US$ 1 billion, as per the IMS Health moving average data of August, 2016.

<!-- image -->

Going forward, our key priorities shall be to strive for market share retention and gains across our key products, to focus on new launches and to successfully remediate the issues raised in the USFDA warning letter - and, in doing so, facilitate other key launches from the three Indian facilities that were the subject of the US regulator's investigations.

## RUSSIA AND CIS

- Strong volume growth in our key brands like Omez, Ciprolet, Cetrine and Ibuclin. Nise, Omez, Ketorol, Ciprolet, Senade and Novigan are the brand leaders in their respective categories, as reported by IMS Health in its moving average report for the 12-months ended 31 March 2017.

Revenue from Russia for FY2017 was ' 11.5 billion, which was a 9% growth over the previous year on the back of healthy volume growth in key brands. Revenue from other CIS countries (including Romania) was ' 3.7 billion, or a year-on-year growth of 4%. The key performance indicators were:

- We continued our momentum in the OTC channel in Russia by focusing on establishing a network of relationships with key pharmacy chains and individual pharmacies. The OTC business grew by 17% year-on-year. It currently accounts for 40% of our business in Russia. We have also seen suffi cient traction in institutional sales to hospitals and expect it to form a signifi cant proportion of our business in the near future. We expect this business to be augmented by the introduction of Reditux®, our Rituximab biosimilar.

Going forward, our focus will be on: (a) portfolio augmentation, to reduce the dependence on key molecules; (b) further strengthening and continuing the momentum of the OTC portfolio; and (c) optimizing the potential of biosimilar drugs in Russia and other CIS Regions (CISR).

In the CISR, we reported healthy growth in Ukraine and Romania. In Ukraine, despite signifi cant currency devaluation in FY2017, we grew our business on account of new product launches and

## VENEZUELA

We are committed to serve this market which has huge unmet needs. However, given the acute currency restrictions in the country, we have opted in favor of a balanced approach: of supplying consignments against letters of credit or binding payment commitments from the government.

## EUROPE

Revenue from Europe for FY2017 was ' 7.6 billion a decline of 2% year-onyear, largely on account of the postBrexit depreciation of the British pound. Generics sales in Europe accounted for approximately 7% of the GG business. Despite competitive pricing pressures in Pregabalin and price pressures on Aripiprazole, we were generally able to sustain the momentum gained in the business from last year. This was supported by new product launches of Imatinib, Voriconazole, Buprenorphine patch and volume gains in Pregabalin. In FY2017, we

embarked on expansion of our footprint in the Europe market with the introduction of a select portfolio of generics across the oncology and anti-infective categories in France, Italy and Spain. We expect good growth from these markets on the back of such new launches.

## INDIA

- In April, 2015, Dr. Reddy's acquired select established brands portfolios from UCB group entities for the territories of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Maldives. This comprised dermatology, respiratory, ENT and pediatrics diseases, and has expanded Dr. Reddy's therapy footprint in these fast growing areas. The task of integrating the UCB portfolio has gone on well and in line with expectations. It provides the company with leading positions in some of the key therapeutic areas.

Revenue from India for FY2017 grew at 9% year-on-year to ' 23.1 billion. This was despite signifi cant headwind from government induced pricing pressures on account of the new National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). India contributes to 20% of revenues of the GG segment. Our growth as per the IMS moving average estimates of March, 2017 has been 4.5% vs market growth of 9.1%. We believe this may be partly due to the higher impact of NLEM on our portfolio. The highlights were:

- We expanded our collaboration with Amgen® to market and distribute three of its products in India: XGEVA® (Denosumab), Vectibix® (Panitumumab) and Prolia® (Denosumab) in the therapeutic areas of oncology and osteoporosis.
- We entered into an agreement with Integra LifeSciences to market and distribute DuraGen Plus® and Suturable DuraGen® dural regeneration matrices in India. These are part of a leading family of dural (or cranial repair) products.

Going forward, the business will focus on: (a) enhancing the benefi ts of the acquisitions and in-licensing deals; (b) enriching the India portfolio through new product launches; (c) building a stronger OTC portfolio with top-of-the-mind brand awareness; and (d) generating market leading growth for key products on an enhanced base.

We strive to deploy the best practices in quality management systems across all our manufacturing locations while expanding on value added offerings across markets.

## PSAI

- During the year, 82 DMFs were fi led globally, of which nine were in the US. The cumulative number of DMF fi lings as on 31 March 2017 was 754.

The PSAI business recorded revenues of ' 21.3 billion in FY2017, which was 5% lower than the previous year. The key developments were:

- In November, 2015, we received a warning letter from USFDA after the inspection of our API manufacturing facilities at Miryalaguda (Telangana) and Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh). These plants were re-inspected by the USFDA from February - April, 2017. Adequate response has been provided to the USFDA for the observations received. The focus in FY2017 was on implementing corrective and preventive remediation actions. However, this impacted the company's output and revenue for the year. Subsequent to the year end, we have received the establishment inspection report (EIR) from the USFDA for the Miryalaguda facility, signifying the closure of all open observations.

We strive to deploy the best practices in quality management systems across all our manufacturing locations while expanding on value added offerings across markets. We also endeavor to improve the fi ling profi le of our DMFs to better serve internal as well as external clients.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

The PP business earned ' 2.4 billion in revenue in FY2017. This represented a decline of 11% over the previous year, primarily due to a temporary supply issue regarding one of our drugs and a reprioritization of our portfolio to accelerate the market uptake of new products. The focus in FY2017 has been on the commercialization of our newly launched products, namely Zembrace TM SymTouch TM (a 3 mg Sumatriptan injection for acute migraine) and Sernivo TM (a Betamethasone Dipropionate 0.05% spray to treat mild-tomoderate plaque psoriasis).

On the R&D front, the focus has been on advancing the development of the two in-licensed assets. These are: (a) XP-23829 acquired from XenoPort, which is a clinical stage new oral entity that has potential for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and may even be developed for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis; and (b) E7777, from Eisai, an anti-cancer agent. In addition, work is going on in developing some internal pipeline products that involve dermatological and neurological assets which are in mid-tolate stage development.

## USFDA OBSERVATIONS: AN UPDATE

The United States Food and Drug Administration ('USFDA') issued a warning letter dated 5 November 2015 (the 'warning letter') relating to current good manufacturing practice ('cGMP') deviations at our active pharmaceutical ingredient ('API') manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as those at our oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The contents of the warning letter emanated from form 483 observations that followed inspections of these three sites by the USFDA in November, 2014, January, 2015 and February-March, 2015, respectively. Pending resolution of the issues identifi ed in the warning letter, the USFDA has withheld approval of new products from these facilities.

Subsequent to the issuance of the warning letter, we promptly instituted corrective actions and preventive actions and submitted a comprehensive response

to the warning letter to the USFDA, followed by periodic written updates and in-person meetings with the USFDA. Moreover, to minimize the business impact, we transferred certain key products to alternative manufacturing facilities.

The USFDA subsequently re-inspected these facilities between February April, 2017. The outcome of these inspections were as follows:

- API facility at Srikakulam: The USFDA raised two observations in the areas of high performance liquid chromatography ('HPLC') maintenance and the management of soft copies of chromatograms.
- API facility at Miryalaguda: The USFDA raised three observations in the areas of older methods of validation, improvements in instrument calibrations and adherence to United States Pharmacopeia ('USP') test methods.
- Oncology formulation facility at Duvvada: The USFDA raised thirteen observations in the areas of investigations, batch production records, document controls, general computer systems and environmental monitoring.

Global corrective actions, as well as some specifi c actions, have already been implemented. Additionally, a detailed response was submitted to the USFDA which included root cause, corrective actions and preventive actions and impact assessment. In June, 2017, the USFDA issued an establishment inspection report which offi cially closed the audit of our API facility at Miryalaguda.

We remain fully committed to follow high standards of quality and strive towards the further strengthening of our quality management systems and processes for sustainability. Our plans to enhance our quality management systems and operations include improvements in rigor of investigations and document control systems, standardization of instrument calibrations, strengthening controls with respect to information technology, strengthening shop fl oor training programs and simplifying and standardizing standard operating procedures and batch records at the shop fl oor .

<!-- image -->

Further, we have initiated additional operational improvements with respect to areas such as shop fl oor supervision and Gemba walks (also known as process walk s) into the shop fl oor, engineering, implementation of electronic batch records to eliminate manual errors and focus on robustness of processes.

Throughout the process of remediating issues raised in the warning letter, we have been continually engaged with the USFDA in conveying the progress we have made.

We are fully committed to produce safe and effi cacious products for our patients. We have the highest respect for the USFDA, its mission and its processes.

## FINANCIALS

## REVENUE

Total revenue declined by 9% to ' 140,809 million in FY2017. As mentioned earlier, this was largely on account of a lower contribution from North America as no major new products were launched during the year coupled with increased competition in key molecules; lower contribution from Emerging Markets primarily due to constrained operations in Venezuela; and some decline in our PSAI business on account of lower off-take of key molecules.

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profi t declined by 15% to ' 78,356 million in FY2017. This was a four percentage points reduction in the gross profi t margin from 59.6% in FY2016 to 55.6% in FY2017. The gross profi t margin for GG was 61.6%. For the PSAI business, it was 21%. As mentioned earlier, factors that negatively affected gross profi t margins for GG were higher price erosion on account of new competition, provisions towards new product inventory, a one-off impairment charge and operational de-leveraging. The PSAI gross margin was affected due to an unfavorable product mix.

## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)

SG&A expenses increased marginally by 1% to ' 46,372 million in FY2017. This was due to higher charges on account of matters relating to the new list of price controls imposed by India's National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA); greater spend on new products in the Proprietary Products business; and some routine items related to manpower and other spends. The increase in SG&A expense was partially offset by lower cost incurred on USFDA remediation related efforts versus FY2016 and the scaling down of operations in Venezuela. SG&A accounted for 32.9% of sales in FY2017.

## R&D EXPENSES

R&D expenses for FY2017 were at ' 19,551 million, or 13.9% of revenue versus 11.5% in FY2016. This increase is in line with our continued focus

on building our complex generics and differentiated products pipeline, including spends on the in-licensed portfolio of assets from Teva and the acquisition of in-process R&D assets of XenoPort and Eisai.

## NET FINANCE INCOME

Net fi nance income was ' 806 million in FY2017 versus a net fi nance expense of ' 2,708 million in FY2016.

## INCOME TAX

For FY2017, income tax expense was ' 2,614 million, with an effective tax rate of 17.8%, compared with ' 7,127 million in FY2016 and an effective tax rate of 26.3%. The decrease in effective tax rate is primarily on account of satisfactory resolution of certain tax matters relating to prior years.

## NET PROFIT

Net profi t decreased by 40% to ' 12,039 million in FY2017. This represents a PAT margin of 8.5% of revenues versus 12.9% in FY2016.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Please refer to Tables 2 and 3 . Cash generated from operating activities in FY2017 was ' 20,859 million. Investing activities amounting to ' 17,871 million in FY2017 includes net investment in property, plant, equipment and intangibles to build capacity and capabilities for future business growth. Cash outfl ow from fi nancing activities was ' 3,641 million. Closing cash and cash equivalents as on 31 March 2017 was ' 3,779 million.

reporting and process aspects to identify and mitigate risks of business units. Mitigation is periodically reviewed and the progress on key risks is discussed with the company's senior management and at the risk management committee of the board.

Risks are aggregated at the unit, function and the organization level and categorized by risk groups. The company's response framework categorizes them into: (i) preventable, (ii) strategic and (iii) external risks. The fi nance, investment and risk management (FIRM) council, is Dr. Reddy's management committee that helps the ERM function to prioritize organization-wide risks and steer mitigation efforts in line with the company's risk capacity and appetite. The FIRM council also oversees fi nancial risk management and capital allocation decisions.

The Chief Risk Offi cer of

Dr. Reddy's provides quarterly updates to the FIRM council and the risk management committee of the board of directors. These include: (i) updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks; and (ii) specifi c riskrelated initiatives carried out during the year.

During the FY2017, the ERM team focused on mitigation of certain country risks, fi rming up cyber security-related controls and also conducted reviews of other execution and operating risks. Regarding fi nancial risk management, the team helped to update the company's capital allocation and employment framework.

## HUMAN RESOURCES (HR)

One of the key focus areas for HR this year has been to foster productivity within our workforce through organization-redesign interventions. This has enabled us to delayer the organization, optimize costs, simplify structures and processes at all levels of the organization, thereby empowering our employees with the resources and autonomy to create impact.

During the FY2017, the ERM team focused on mitigation of certain country risks, fi rming up cyber securityrelated controls and also conducted reviews of other execution and operating risks.

We have also strengthened our approach towards an integrated talent management process with a specifi c focus on strengthening the leadership pipeline and creating a culture of continuous feedback. A detailed career development framework along with business units and career tracks by job families was created for all our employees. Managers were trained on conducting effective career conversations. Employees were encouraged to leverage this as an opportunity to introspect on their strengths, development areas and plot the next step in their careers with us.

A steady intake of entry level talent from premier engineering and management institutes remained a key priority for the year. We redesigned our learning offerings as complete experiences rather than one day workshops, with a focus on delivering learning interventions that impact both business and behaviour. We continue our fl agship leadership development program (NHLP) for our senior leaders. This program delivered outstanding outcomes both in personal development and breakthrough business results.

We further strengthened our position as an employer of choice for women. We piloted a 'speed mentoring' program for women in mid management and conducted workshops on gender sensitization and unconscious biases. We were ranked number one in the 'Diversity in Corporate Asia' list issued by Carnstone. We were also conferred with the BengtLindqvist inclusive employer award for building an accessible workplace and encouraging differently abled employees within the company.

Our efforts at building a productive and diverse workplace have also enabled us to get recognized and certifi ed as a great place to work.

## OUTLOOK

- a) Signifi cant price erosion in our US business, primarily due to new competition and also rapid channel consolidation.

In FY2017, our performance was affected due to multiple factors, such as:

- b) Delay in launch of our new products, specifi cally complex generics assets, due to incremental requirements, lack of clear guidelines/precedence from regulatory authorities for the approval of these products, plus the 'hold' on key product launches on account of the USFDA's warning letter of November, 2015.
- d) Decline in our PSAI business on account of lower off-take of key molecules.
- c) Rapid decline of the Venezuela business and price erosions in India due to government interventions through price controls.

While it is diffi cult to predict what the fi nal decision the USFDA will take regarding our responses to the reinspection of the three affected sites, we believe that our remedial actions regarding quality assurance and good manufacturing practices have been more than adequate and appropriate. We shall continue to focus on enhancing our quality systems and processes, across all our plants, and be even more proactive in identifying 'what can go wrong' and in taking preventive and corrective actions. All else being equal, we ought to be able to launch our new complex generics products and injectibles in FY2018.

That aside, we look forward to several new product launches in the US in FY2018. In addition, we are focusing on new launches in other geographies, especially in the Emerging Markets, Russia and CISR and in Europe. We also expect to optimize our biosimilar and oncology portfolio across multiple markets and generate higher growth.

We have built up an attractive pipeline of complex generics offerings and new Proprietary Product drugs. In FY2018 we will strive to leverage these across North America, Europe, Russia and CISR. In the last two geographies, we look forward to higher traction for our biosimilar offerings. We are also working on increasing our OTC offerings in the US, India and Russia. The PSAI business is expected to turn around.

Therefore, as we see it, despite the downturn in FY2017, we have reasons to be cautiously optimistic about our prospects in FY2018.

views to the company's management while discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, thereby ensuring that the management adheres to high standards of ethics, transparency and disclosure.

The board regularly reviews the company's governance, risk and compliance framework, business plans, and organization structure to align with the highest global standards.

Each director informs the company on an annual basis about the board and board committee positions she/he occupies in other companies, and notifi es it of any changes regarding their directorships. In addition, the independent directors provide an annual confi rmation that they meet the criteria of independence as defi ned under Indian laws. Table 1 gives the composition of Dr. Reddy's board, with all relevant details.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

The board, on recommendations of the nomination, governance and compensation committee, considers the appointment and re-appointment of directors.

Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013, provides that an independent director shall hold offi ce up to fi ve consecutive years on the board of a company and shall be eligible for re-appointment on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders. Moreover, independent directors cannot retire by rotation. Accordingly, all independent directors of Dr. Reddy's were appointed as such for terms ranging from one to fi ve years at the 30th annual general meeting of the company. The term of Dr. Ashok S Ganguly, an independent director, ends at the forthcoming 33rd annual general meeting on 28 July 2017.

Section 152 of the Companies Act, 2013, states that one-third of the board members other than independent directors who are subject to retire by rotation, shall do so every year and be eligible for re-appointment, if approved by the shareholders. Mr. G V Prasad, whole-time director, retires by rotation at the forthcoming annual general meeting and, being eligible, seeks re-appointment. Additionally, the board of directors at its meeting held on 12 May 2017 re-appointed Mr. K Satish Reddy as wholetime director designated as the chairman

of the company. Thus, in the forthcoming annual general meeting, approval of shareholders is being sought for:

- 1 October 2017.
- i. Re-appointment of Mr. K Satish Reddy, as whole-time director designated as the chairman, for a period of fi ve years with effect from
- ii. Re-appointment of Mr. G V Prasad, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-appointment.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Induction of any new member on the board is the responsibility of the nomination, governance and compensation committee of the board, which consists entirely of independent directors. Given the existing composition of the board, the need for new domain expertise is reviewed by this committee. When such a need becomes apparent, the committee reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings in India. It then places the details of shortlisted candidates to the board for its consideration. If the board approves, the person is appointed as an additional director, subject to the approval of shareholders in the company's next general meeting.

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new independent director with the company, an information kit containing documents about the company - such as its annual reports, sustainability reports, investor presentations, recent press releases, research reports and the memorandum and articles of association is provided. The new independent director individually meets with board members and senior management. Visits to plants are also organized for the person to understand the company's operations.

Dr. Reddy's believes that the board should be continuously empowered with knowledge of the latest developments affecting the company and the industry. Apart from regular presentations on the company's business strategies and associated risks, expositions are made on various topics covering the pharmaceutical industry. Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial

pronouncements around industryrelated laws are regularly circulated to the directors. They also visit the company's manufacturing and research locations. Each director has complete access to any company information and full freedom to interact with senior management.

Details of the familiarization programs for independent directors are available on the company's website: www.drreddys. com/media/504283/familliarizationprocess-2017.pdf

## LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Upon their appointment, independent directors are given a formal appointment letter containing, inter alia , the term of appointment, roles, function, duties and responsibilities, the company's code of conduct, disclosures and confi dentiality. For such terms and conditions, see: www.drreddys.com/investor/governance/ policies-and-documents/terms-conditiondirectors.html

## BOARD EVALUATION

The board carries out an annual evaluation of its performance, as well as the working of its committees. On two such occasions, an independent expert was engaged to conduct the evaluation process. For the annual internal evaluation, each director completes a questionnaire that involves peer evaluation and feedback on the processes of the board and its committees. The contribution and impact of individual members is evaluated on a number of parameters, such as level of engagement, independence of judgment, confl icts resolution and contributions to enhance the board's overall effectiveness. Peer ratings on certain parameters, positive attributes and improvement areas for each director are provided to them on a confi dential basis.

## DIRECTORS' SHAREHOLDING IN THE COMPANY

Table 2 gives details of shares held by the directors as on 31 March 2017.

## MEETINGS OF THE BOARD

The company plans and prepares the schedule of the board and board committee meetings eighteen to twenty four months in advance. The schedule of meetings and their agendas are fi nalized in consultation with the chairman of the board and committee chairpersons.

Agendas are pre-circulated in advance with appropriate presentations, detailed notes, supporting documents and executive summaries.

Dr. Reddy's board met four times during the fi nancial year under review: on 12 May 2016, 26 July 2016, 25 October 2016 and 4 February 2017.

## DETAILS OF POSTAL BALLOT

## PERSON WHO CONDUCTED THE POSTAL BALLOT PROCESS

Mr. G Raghu Babu, company secretary in practice and partner of M/s. R & A Associates, company secretaries, Hyderabad (membership no. F4448 and certifi cate of practice no. 2820) was appointed as the scrutinizer for carrying out the postal ballot process for the above item in a fair and transparent manner.

## PROPOSAL TO CONDUCT POSTAL BALLOT FOR ANY MATTER IN THE ENSUING ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING

There is no proposal to conduct postal ballot for any matter in the ensuing annual general meeting.

## PROCEDURE FOR POSTAL BALLOT

In compliance with the Listing Regulations and sections 108, 110 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, read with applicable rules, the company provides an electronic voting facility to all its shareholders, to enable them to cast their votes electronically. The company engages the services of NSDL for the purpose of providing the e-voting facility to all its shareholders. The shareholders have the option to vote either by physical ballot or e-voting.

The company dispatches the postal ballot notices and forms along with selfaddressed business reply envelopes to its shareholders whose names appear on the register of members/list of benefi ciaries as on a cut-off date. The postal ballot notice is sent to the shareholders in electronic form to the email addresses registered with the depository participants/registrar and transfer agent.

Voting rights are reckoned on the paid up value of the shares registered in the names of the shareholders as on the cutoff date. Shareholders desiring to exercise their votes by physical postal ballot forms

are requested to return the forms duly completed and signed, to the scrutinizer on or before the closing of the voting period. Shareholders desiring to exercise their votes by electronic mode are requested to vote before close of business hours on the last day of e-voting. The last date specifi ed by the company for receipt of duly completed postal ballot forms or e-voting is deemed to be the date of passing of the resolution.

The scrutinizer submits his report to the chairman of the board of directors after the completion of scrutiny, and the consolidated results of the voting by postal ballot are then announced by the chairman. The results are also displayed on the website of the company: www.drreddys. com, besides being communicated to the stock exchanges, depository and registrar and transfer agent.

## DISCLOSURE ON LEGAL PROCEEDINGS PERTAINING TO SHARES

There are two pending cases relating to disputes over title of the shares of the company, in which the company has been made a party. These cases, however, are not material in nature.

## UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS/ INTEREST

Pursuant to section 125 of the Companies Act, 2013, unclaimed dividend amounts up to and including for the FY2009 have been transferred to the general revenue account of the Central Government/Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF).

The dividends and interest on debentures for the following years, which remain unclaimed for seven years will be transferred to IEPF established by the Central Government under section 125 of the Companies Act, 2013. Table 10 gives the transfer dates in this regard.

Bonus debentures, issued by the company in the year 2011, matured on 24 March 2014. These were redeemed for cash at face value of ' 5/- each along with third and fi nal year's interest. Shareholders/debenture holders who have not claimed the dividend(s)/ interest/redemption amount are, therefore, requested to do so before they are statutorily transferred to the IEPF.

## BOARD'S REPORT

Dear members,

Your directors are pleased to present the 33rd annual report for the year ended 31 March 2017.

## FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

## COMPANY AFFAIRS

The company's standalone net revenue for the year was ' 103.11 billion, a decline of 2.88% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this amounted to $ 1.59 billion. Profi t before tax (PBT) was ' 15.45 billion, a decline of 7.88% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this translates into $ 238 million.

Consolidated net revenue for the year was ' 143.68 billion, a decline of 9.43% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this amounted to $ 2.21 billion. PBT was ' 15.54 billion, a decline of 45.65% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this translates into $ 240 million.

Revenue from Global Generics declined by 10% and stood at ' 115.41 billion, driven largely by North America and Emerging Markets.

Revenue from North America declined by 16% and stood at ' 63.6 billion. This is primarily on account of increased competition in our key products namely Valganciclovir, Decitabine, Azacitidine etc. coupled with discontinuation of the McNeil business. During the year, the company launched 10 products, the major ones being Omeprazole Sodium Bicarbonate and Nitroglycerin Sublingual tablets. FY2017 also saw 26 ANDA fi lings in the USA. As of 31 March 2017, cumulatively 101 generic fi lings are pending for approval with the USFDA (99 ANDAs and two NDAs under 505(b)(2) route). Of these 99 ANDAs, 62 are Para IVs out of which we believe 21 have 'First to File' status.

Revenue from Emerging Markets was ' 21.1 billion, a decline of 11% on a yearon-year basis. Revenue from India stood at ' 23.1 billion, registering a year-onyear growth of 9%.

Revenues from PSAI stood at ' 21.3 billion, a decline of 5% on a year-on-year

basis. During the year, 82 DMFs wer e fi led globally of which nine were in the US. The cumulative number of DMF fi lings as of 31 March 2017 was 754.

## DIVIDEND

Your directors are pleased to recommend a dividend of ' 20/- on every equity share of ' 5/- (400%) for FY2017. The dividend, if approved at the 33rd annual general meeting (AGM), will be paid to those shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the company as of the end of day on 18 July 2017.

In terms of regulations 43A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations), the company has revised its dividend distribution policy. This policy was originally adopted on 18 May 2009. The policy is attached as Annexure I to the board's report.

## TRANSFER TO RESERVES

The company proposes to transfer ' 1,355 million to the general reserve.

## ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

We have audited the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company") as of 31 March 2017 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone fi nancial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal fi nancial controls based on the internal contr ol over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal fi nancial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable fi nancial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing as specifi ed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal fi nancial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to pr ovide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fi nancial reporting and the preparation of fi nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly refl ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal fi nancial contr ol over fi nancial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE (CONTINUED)

## 1.2 Basis of preparation of fi nancial statements

The fi nancial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("Dr. Reddy's" or "the Company") have been prepared and presented in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notifi ed under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2016. For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company prepared its fi nancial statements in accordance with accounting standards notifi ed under Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read with Rule 7 of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014. These fi nancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 are the fi rst the Company has prepared in accordance with Ind AS.

Refer note 2.19 for information on how the Company adopted Ind AS.

These fi nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

-   derivative fi nancial instruments are measured at fair value;
-   certain fi nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the classifi cation;
-   employee defi ned benefi t assets/(liability) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan assets, plus actuarial losses, less actuarial gains and the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation; and
-   long-term borrowings, except obligations under fi nance leases, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

## 1.3 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about signifi cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signifi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes:

- · Note 1.4 (a) - Assessment of functional currency;
- · Note 1.4 (q) - Financial instruments;
- · Note 1.4 (b) - Business combinations;
- · Notes 1.4 (j) and 1.4 (k) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- · Note 1.4 (m) - Valuation of inventories;
- · Note 1.4 (n) - Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.4 Signifi cant accounting policies

## a) Functional currency

These fi nancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is also the functional currency of the Company. All fi nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

## b) Business combinations and goodwill

In accordance with Ind AS 101 provisions related to fi rst time adoption, the Company has elected to apply Ind AS accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition methsod of accounting to account for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgment is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the fair value of the net identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, the excess is recognised in equity as capital reserve. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the defi nition of a fi nancial instrument is classifi ed as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifi able net assets. Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination, such as fi nder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

## c) Current and non current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.

## Assets:

An asset is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets/ liabilities include the current portion of non current assets/ liabilities respectively. All other assets/ liabilities are classifi ed as non current.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## d) Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated o n initial recognition during the period or in previous fi nancial statements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash fl ows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## e) Revenue

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

Revenue from sales of generic products in India is recognised upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company. Signifi cant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of generic products are transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. Clearing and forwarding agents are generally compensated on a commission basis as a percentage of sales made by them. Revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in India is recognised on delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories of the Company.

Revenue from export sales and other sales outside of India is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred to the customers, which occurs upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for specifi c revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised once all such activities are completed.

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profi t share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profi t share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profi ts, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profi t share component is recognised as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profi t share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profi t share is available. Otherwise, recognition is deferred to a subsequent period pending satisfaction of such collectability and measurability requirements. In measuring the amount of profi t share revenue to be recognised for each period, the Company uses all available information and evidence, including any confi rmations from the business partner of the profi t share amount owed to the Company, to the extent made available before the date the Company's Board of Directors authorises the issuance of its fi nancial statements for the applicable period.

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive, or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## f) Government grants

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signifi cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## g) Interest income and dividend

Interest income primarily comprises of interest from term deposits with banks and on loans to subsidiary companies. Interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the fi nancial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the fi nancial asset. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profi t and loss.

Dividend income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

## h) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for fi nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profi t; differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefi t will be realised.

The Company recognises deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfi ed:

- a) When the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and
- b) it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

## i) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## j) Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefi ts embodied within the part will fl ow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life, whichever is shorter.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change(s) are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors .

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|                                            | Years    |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                  |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                     | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and machinery                        | 5 to 10  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi ce equipment | 4 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                   | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date is disclosed as capital advances under other non current assets. The cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated.

## k) Goodwill and other intangible assets

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of identifi able net assets acquired.

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.

## Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have fi nite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditures are capitalised only when they increase the future economic benefi ts embodied in the specifi c asset to which they relate.

## Research and development

Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientifi c or technical knowledge and understanding are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditures are capitalised only if:

-   development costs can be measured reliably;
-   the product or process is technically and commercially feasible;
-   future economic benefi ts are probable; and
-   the Company intends to and has suffi cient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

The expenditures to be capitalised include the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditures are recognised as expense in the statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Payments to third parties that generally take the form of up-front payments and milestones for in-licensed products, compounds and intellectual property are capitalised. The Company's criteria for capitalisation of such assets are consistent with the guidance given in paragraph 25 of Ind AS 38 (i.e., receipt of economic benefi ts out of the separately purchased transaction is considered to be probable).

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognised as Intangible assets under development. Theses assets are not amortised, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such assets is recorded as an expense in the statement of profi t and loss.

Subsequent expenditure on an in-process research or development project acquired separately or in a business combination and recognised as an intangible asset is:

-   recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is research expenditure;
-   recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is development expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset; and
-   added to the carrying amount of the acquired in-process research or development project, if it is development expenditure that satisfi es the recognition criteria.

Intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefi nite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets or on any other basis that refl ects the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefi ts are expected to be consumed by the entity. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|                                                                    | Years   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Customer contracts                                                 | 2 to 5  |
| Technical know-how                                                 | 10      |
| Product related intangibles                                        | 5 to 15 |
| Copyrights and Patents (including marketing / distribution rights) | 3 to 15 |
| Others                                                             | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a fi nite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefi ts are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the statement of profi t and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as on the date of de-recognition.

## l) Leases

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classifi ed as either a fi nance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under fi nance leases are apportioned between the fi nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The fi nance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## m) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and fi nished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of fi nished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares, that do not qualify to be recognised as property, plant and equipment, consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the allowance for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## n) Impairment of non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-fi nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefi nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defi ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash infl ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash infl ows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefi t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are alloca ted fi rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss, and reversed if there has been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## o) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefi ts are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defi ned contribution plans are charged to the statement of profi t and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefi t plans and other post-employment benefi ts is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outfl ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefi ts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefi t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defi ned benefi t plan, recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in employee benefi t expense, refl ects the increase in the defi ned benefi t obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefi t changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefi t obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefi t expense in the statement of profi t and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefi ts are recognised as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefi ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.Termination benefi ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefi ts is the amount of future benefi t that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefi t is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Share-based payments

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## p) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outfl ow of economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash fl ows at a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outfl ow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

## Contingent assets

Contingent assets are not recognised in the fi nancial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an infl ow of economic benefi ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## q) Financial instruments

A fi nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a fi nancial asset of one entity and a fi nancial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

## Initial recognition and measurement

All fi nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of fi nancial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the fi nancial asset. Purchases or sales of fi nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

-   Debt instruments at amortised cost
-   Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
-   Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profi t or loss (FVTPL)
-   Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows, and
- b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specifi ed dates to cash fl ows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such fi nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in other income in the statement of profi t and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A 'debt instrument' is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets, and
- b) The asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassifi ed to the statem ent of profi t and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). The Company has not designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS103 applies are classifi ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The classifi cation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the statement of profi t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognized in the statement of profi t and loss.

Upon fi rst-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1 April 2015.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fi nancial asset or part of a group of similar fi nancial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

-   The rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired, or
-   The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the r eceived cash fl ows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement ; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that refl ects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For this purpose, the Company follows 'simplifi ed approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of simplifi ed approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classifi ed, at initial recognition, as fi nancial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All fi nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's fi nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, fi nancial guarantee contracts and derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of fi nancial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss include fi nancial liabilities held for trading and fi nancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative fi nancial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defi ned by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profi t or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfi ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/ losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profi t and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. The company has not designated any fi nancial liability as fair value through profi t and loss.

## Loans and borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as fi nance costs in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an exist ing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modifi cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Venezuelan bolivars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles and Euros.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivative fi nancial instruments) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non derivative fi nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifi es its derivative fi nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classifi ed to the statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash fl ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain / loss on such non derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassifi ed to the statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## r) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of our cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash fl ows.

## 1.5 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain fi nancial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specifi c to that asset or liability.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method after deduction of a fair return on other assets that are part of creating the related cash fl ows.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profi t margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and inter est cash fl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For fi nance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have fl oating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share da ta and wher e otherwise stated)

## FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS

These fi nancial statements, for the year ended 31 March 2017, are the fi rst time the Company has prepared in accordance with Ind AS. For periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company prepared its fi nancial statements in accordance with accounting standards notifi ed under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (Indian GAAP).

Accordingly, the Company has prepared fi nancial statements which comply with Ind AS applicable for periods ending on 31 March 2017, together with the comparative period data as at and for the year ended 31 March 2016, as described in the summary of signifi cant accounting policies. In preparing these fi nancial statements, the Company's opening balance sheet was prepared as at 1 April 2015, the Company's date of transition to Ind AS. This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its Indian GAAP fi nancial statements, including the balance sheet as at 1 April 2015 and the fi nancial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2016.

## Exemptions applied

Ind AS 101 allows fi rst-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under Ind AS. The Company has applied the following exemptions:

Ind AS 103, Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions, which are considered businesses under Ind AS that occurred before 1 April 2015. Use of this exemption means that the Indian GAAP carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required to be recognised under Ind AS, is their deemed cost at the date of the acquisition. After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with respective Ind AS. The Company recognises all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a past business combination, except (i) certain fi nancial assets and liabilities that were derecognised and that fall under the derecognition exception, and (ii) assets (including goodwill) and liabilities that were not recognised in the acquirer's balance sheet under its previous GAAP and that would not qualify for recognition under Ind AS in the individual balance sheet of the acquiree. Assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under Ind AS are excluded from the opening Ind AS balance sheet. The Company did not recognise or exclude any previously recognised amounts as a result of Ind AS recognition requirements.

Ind AS 101 also requires that Indian GAAP carrying amount of goodwill must be used in the opening Ind AS balance sheet (apart from adjustments for goodwill impairment and recognition or derecognition of intangible assets). In accordance with Ind AS 101, the Company has tested goodwill for impairment at the date of transition to Ind AS. No goodwill impairment was deemed necessary at 1 April 2015.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets balances were in compliance with Ind AS 16 and Ind AS 38, respectively with a retrospective effect.

Ind AS 102, Share-based Payment has not been applied to equity instruments in share-based payment transactions that vested before 1 April 2015.

## FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS (CONTINUED)

The Company does not have any arrangements containing a lease as defi ned under Appendix C to Ind AS 17, "Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease". Consequently, this exemption is not applicable to the Company.

## Estimates

The estimates at 1 April 2015 and at 31 March 2016 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with Indian GAAP (after adjustments to refl ect any differences in accounting policies) apart from the following items where application of Indian GAAP did not require estimation:

-  FVTOCI - Quoted equity shares
-  Impairment of fi nancial assets based on expected credit loss model

The estimates used by the Company to present these amounts in accordance with Ind AS refl ect conditions at 1 April 2015, the date of transition to Ind AS and as of 31 March 2016.

## a) Proposed dividend

Under Indian GAAP, proposed dividends including dividend distribution tax are recognised as a liability in the period to which they relate, irrespective of when they are declared. Under Ind AS, a proposed dividend is recognised as a liability in the period in which it is declared by the company (usually when approved by shareholders in a general meeting) or paid. Therefore, the liability of ' 4,100 for the year ended on 31 March 2015 recorded for dividend has been derecognised against retained earnings on 1 April 2015.

## b) FVTOCI fi nancial assets

Under Indian GAAP, the Company accounted for long-term investments in quoted equity shares as investment measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments. Under Ind AS, the Company has designated such investments as FVTOCI investments. Ind AS requires FVTOCI investments to be measured at fair value. At the date of transition to Ind AS, difference between the instruments fair value and Indian GAAP carrying amount has been recognised as a separate component of equity, in the retained earnings, net of related deferred taxes.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.19 FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS (CONTINUED)

## c) Mutual funds

Under Indian GAAP, investments in mutual funds are accounted for as short-term investments and accordingly they are carried at lower of cost and fair value. Under Ind AS, the Company has designated such investments as FVTPL investments. Ind AS requires FVTPL investments to be measured at fair value. At the date of transition to Ind AS, difference between the instruments fair value and Indian GAAP carrying amount has been recognised as a separate component of equity, in the retained earnings, net of related deferred taxes.

## d) Deferred tax

Indian GAAP requires deferred tax accounting using the statement of profi t and loss approach, which focuses on differences between taxable profi ts and accounting profi ts for the period. Ind AS 12 requires entities to account for deferred taxes using the balance sheet approach, which focuses on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. The application of Ind AS 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred tax on new temporary differences which was not required under Indian GAAP.

## e) Trade receivables

Under Ind AS, impairment allowance has been determined based on Expected Credit Loss model (ECL). Due to ECL model, the group impaired its trade receivable by ' 40 on 1 April 2015 which has been eliminated against retained earnings.

## f) In-process research and development expenditure

Under Indian GAAP, in-process research and development expenditure does not qualify for capitalisation as intangible asset. Under Ind AS, such expenditure is allowed to be capitalised as intangible asset. As the asset is not available for use yet, it is not subject to amortisation. However, the same is tested for impairment following the guidance available under Ind AS 38, Intangible assets.

## g) Sale of goods

Under Indian GAAP, sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty. However, under Ind AS, sale of goods includes excise duty. Excise duty on sale of goods is included as part of sales in the face of statement of profi t and loss. Thus sale of goods under Ind AS for the year ended 31 March 2016 has increased by ' 842 with a corresponding increase in cost of material consumed.

## h) Defi ned benefi t liabilities

Both under Indian GAAP and Ind AS, the Company recognised costs related to its post-employment defi ned benefi t plan on an actuarial basis. Under Indian GAAP, the entire cost, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to the statement of profi t and loss. Under Ind AS, remeasurements (comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defi ned benefi t liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defi ned benefi t liability) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI. Thus the employee benefi t cost is reduced by ' 183 and remeasurement gains/ losses on defi ned benefi t plans has been recognised in the OCI, net of tax.

## i) Share-based payments

Under Indian GAAP, the Company recognised only the intrinsic value of the options granted as an expense. Ind AS requires the fair value of the share options to be determined using an appropriate pricing model recognised over the vesting period. An additional expense of ' 16 has been recognised in the statement of profi t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2016.

## EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of DRL (the "Committee") administer the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at Annual General Meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A : 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

As of 31 March 2017, options outstanding under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 232 and options exercisable under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 17.

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company adopted a new program to grant performance linked stock options to certain employees under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan. Under this program, performance targets are measured each year against pre-defi ned interim targets over the three year period ending on 31 March 2017 and eligible employees are granted stock options upon meeting such targets. The stock options so granted are ultimately vested with the employees who meet subsequent service vesting conditions which range from one to four years. After vesting, such stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

## EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS (CONTINUED)

Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted under category B, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term, contractual term, as well as expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted under category A, the option life is estimated based on the simplifi ed method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions refl ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Gratuity benefi ts provided by the Company

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a defi ned benefi t plan which provides for gratuity payments (the "Gratuity Plan") and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund") to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by Government of India, corporate debt securities and in equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the statement of profi t and loss for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 consist of the following:

- * As per Indian tax laws, companies are liable for a Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT" tax) when current tax, as computed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ("Tax Act"), is determined to be below the MAT tax computed under section 115JB of the Tax Act. The excess of MAT tax over current tax is eligible to be carried forward and set-off in the future against the current tax liabilities over a period of 15 years.

## INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

In assessing whether the deferred tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefi ts of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Operating loss carry forward mainly consists of unabsorbed depreciation which can be carried forwarded without any restriction on time limit.

## Fair value hierarchy

- Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
- Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The following table presents the fair value hierarchy of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of 31 March 2017:

The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves. As at 31 March 2017, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other fi nancial instruments recognised at fair value.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk that arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Venezuelan bolivars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles and Euros. The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and currency swap contracts (collectively, "derivatives") to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank or a fi nancial institution. The Company had a derivative fi nancial asset and deriva tive fi nancial liability of ' 220 and ' 6, respectively, as at 31 March 2017 as compared to derivative fi nancial asset and derivative fi nancial liability of ' 175 and ' 52, respectively, as at 31 March 2016 towards these derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifi es its derivative contracts that hedge foreign exchange risk associated with its highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded as a component of equity within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classifi ed in the statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is immediately recorded in the statement of profi t and loss as a foreign exchange gain and losses.

The Company also designates certain non derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign exchange risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash fl ow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded as a component of equity within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classifi ed in the statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

In respect of the aforesaid hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions, the Company recorded, as a component of equity, a net gain of ' 145, and a net loss of ' 65 for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 respectively.

The Company also recorded, as a component of revenue, a net gain of ' 136 and ' 299 during the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, respectively.

The net carrying amount of the Company's "hedging reserve" as a component of equity before adjusting for tax impact was a gain of ' 129 as at 31 March 2017, as compared to a loss of ' 19 as at 31 March 2016.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

The changes in fair value of such interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of fi nance cost.

As at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of fi nancial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to refl ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Creditrisk

Credit risk is the risk of fi nancial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a fi nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is infl uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an infl uence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating.The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signifi cant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Company uses Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for assessing the impairment loss. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers.

## b. Liquidityrisk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its fi nancial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, the Company had unutilised credit limits from banks of ' 12,437 and ' 12,304 respectively.

As at 31 March 2017, the Company had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of ' 43,358, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 668, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certifi cates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 2,110 and investments in FVTPL fi nancial assets of ' 10,881. As at 31 March 2016, the Company had working capital of ' 58,224, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 2,021, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certifi cates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 10,660 and investments in FVTPL fi nancial assets of ' 22,320.

## c. Marketrisk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive fi nancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in US dollars, Russian roubles, UK pounds sterling, and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in US dollars and Russian roubles,). A signifi cant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a signifi cant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fl uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non derivative fi nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency fi nancial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.34 above.

In respect of the Company's forward contracts, option contracts and currency swap contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- · a ' 1,154/(710) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 1,707/(1,854) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2017;
- · a ' 1,511/(424) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 1,193/(1,588) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2016.

The carrying value of the Company's foreign currency borrowings designated in a cash fl ow hedge as of 31 March 2017 was ' Nil. In respect of these borrowings, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such borrowings would have resulted in a ' 182 increase/decrease in the Company's hedging reserve as at 31 March 2016.

For the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned fi nancial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profi t by approximately ' 1,866 and ' 224, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, the Company had ' 18,061 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of LIBOR minus 30 bps to LIBOR plus 82.7 bps and ' 27,730 of foreign currency loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of LIBOR minus 5 to LIBOR plus 125 bps, respectively. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profi les, refer to note 2.8A and 2.8B of these fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, every 10% increase or decrease in the fl oating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by approximately ' 23 and ' 11, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certifi cates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate signifi cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fl uctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2017, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more signifi cant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected fi nancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case. The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its fi nancial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgments against the Company, such judgments could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Norfl oxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfl oxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfl oxacin. Under the Drugs Prices Control Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specifi ed product" and fi x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notifi cation and designated Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" and fi xed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company fi led a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fi xing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favor of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company fi led a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fi xed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest. The C ompany fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company fi led an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA fi led a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfl oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the fi eld. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings.

During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fi xing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfl oxacin was fi led by the Company with the Delhi High Court. Such writ petition is pending for admission.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifi cations regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and anti-diabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, fi led a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifi cations issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition fi led by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to a few products of the Company for recovery of the allegedly overcharged amounts. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA fi led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the High Court dated 26 September 2016 on the grounds that certain information important for the determination of the issue was not disclosed by the counsel representing the Union of India during the proceedings before the Bombay High Court.

On 26 April 2017, the Bombay High Court heard the recall application and directed the matter to the same bench of judges of the Bombay High Court which passed the original judgement on 26 September 2016. Further, it also directed the Union of India and others to fi le their reply.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued demand notices to the Company relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. The Company has responded to these notices.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 374 under "other selling expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

In the event the Government of India pursues litigation against the Company on the aforementioned NPPA matters for the excess sales proceeds and the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (ii) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action fi led a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Company believes that the likelihood of additional liability is remote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company along with the alleged polluting industries have challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-fi nding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notifi cation in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notifi cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (iii) Indirect taxes related matters

Distribution of input service tax credits

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various demand notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED                               | STATUS                                                                    |

| April 2013 to March 2014          | '  69 plus interest and penalties             | The Company has fi led an appeal before the CESTAT.                       |
| April 2014 to March 2015          | '  108 plus interest and penalties            | The Company is the in process of submitting an appeal  before the CESTAT. |

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2017.

## Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company has received various demand notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED        | STATUS                                                                                |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 27 as of 31 March 2017, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 174. The Company has responded to such notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2017.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

## (iv) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions fi led by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. As of 31 March 2017, the Company has made "payments under protest" of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additi onal fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition fi led by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (v) Direct taxes related matters

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Indian Income Tax authorities disallowed for tax purposes certain business transactions entered into by the Company with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The associated tax impact is ' 570. The Company believes that such business transactions are allowed for tax deduction under Indian Income Tax laws and accordingly fi led an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Authorities. On 28 April 2017, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal of Hyderabad issued a judgment in favor of the Company confi rming the Company's position.

Additionally, the Company is contesting various other disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 1,555. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavorable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and, accordingly, no provision is made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2017.

## (vi) Others

Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse ef fect on its fi nancial statements.

RECEIPT OF WARNING LETTER FROM THE U.S. FDA

The Company received a warning letter dated 5 November 2015 from the U.S. FDA relating to current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") deviations at its active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as violations at its oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The contents of the warning letter emanated from Form 483 observations that followed inspections of these sites by the U.S. FDA in November 2014, January 2015 and February-March 2015, respectively.

The warning letter does not restrict production or shipment of the Company's products from these facilities. However, unless and until the Company is able to correct outstanding issues to the U.S. FDA's satisfaction, the U.S. FDA may withhold approval of new products and new drug applications of the Company, refuse admission of products manufactured at the facilities noted in the warning letter into the United States, and/ or take additional regulatory or legal action against the Company. Any such further action could have a material and negative impact on the Company's ongoing business and operations. During the years ended 31 March 2016 and 31 March 2017, U.S. FDA withheld approval of new products fro, these facilities pending resolution of the issues identifi ed in the warning letter. To minimise the business impact, the Company transferred certain key products to alternate manufacturing facilities.

Subsequent to the issuance of the warning letter, the Company promptly instituted corrective actions and preventive actions and submitted a comprehensive response to the warning letter to the U.S. FDA, followed by periodic written updates and in-person meetings with the U.S. FDA. The U.S. FDA completed the re-inspection of the aforementioned manufacturing facilities in the months of March and April 2017. During the re-inspections, the U.S. FDA issued three observations with respect to the API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda, two observations with respect to the API manufacturing facility at Srikakulam and thirteen observations with respect to the Oncology formulation manufacturing facility. The Company has responded to these observations identifi ed by the U.S. FDA, and believes that it can resolve them satisfactorily in a timely manner.

## SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

There are no signifi cant events that occurred after the balance sheet date.

## 2.46 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted by the Company.

Amendment to Ind AS 7, Statement of Cash fl ows

The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities to provide disclosures that enable users of fi nancial statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from fi nancing activities, including both changes arising from cash fl ows and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances in the balance sheet for liabilities arising from fi nancing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the aforementioned requirement on the fi nancial statements of the Company.

Amendment to Ind AS 102, Share-based payment

The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specifi c guidance to measurement of cash-settled awards, modifi cation of cash-settled awards and awards that include a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<!-- image -->

## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (CONTINUED)

It clarifi es that the fair value of cash-settled awards is determined on a basis consistent with that used for equity settled awards. Market-based performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are refl ected in the 'fair values', but non-market performance conditions and service vesting conditions are refl ected in the estimate of the number of awards expected to vest.Also, the amendment clarifi es that if the terms and conditions of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modifi ed with the result that it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the transaction is accounted for as such from the date of the modifi cation.

Further, the amendment requires the award that includes a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes to be treated as equity-settled in its entirety. The cash payment to the tax authority is treated as if it was part of an equity settlement.

The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the aforementioned requirement on the fi nancial state ments of the Company.

Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting.

## ANNEXURE TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE (CONTINUED)

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fi nancial reporting and the preparation of fi nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly refl ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal fi nancial contr ol over fi nancial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, an adequate internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting and such internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2017, based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

## Other Matters

Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting of the Holding Company, insofar as it relates to these seven subsidiary companies, and two joint venture companies, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiary companies, and joint venture companies incorporated in India.

## 1.2 Basis of preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements

The consolidated fi nancial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notifi ed under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2016. For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group prepared its fi nancial statements in accordance with accounting standards notifi ed under Section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read with Rule 7 of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014. These fi nancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2017 are the fi rst the Group has prepared in accordance with Ind AS.

Refer note 2.19 for information on how the Group adopted Ind AS.

These consolidated fi nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

-   derivative fi nancial instruments are measured at fair value;
-   certain fi nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the classifi cation;
-   employee defi ned benefi t assets/(liability) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan assets, plus actuarial losses, less actuarial gains and the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation;
-   long-term borrowings, except obligations under fi nance leases, are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method; and
-   investments in joint ventures which are accounted for using the equity method.

## 1.3 Use of estimates and judgments

The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about signifi cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signifi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes:

- · Note 1.4 (b) - Evaluation of joint arrangements;
- · Note 1.4 (a) - Assessment of functional currency;
- · Note 1.4 (r) - Financial instruments;

- · Note 1.4 (q) - Contingencies

## 1.4 Signifi cant accounting policies

## a) Functional currency

These consolidated fi nancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All fi nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of all non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these subsidiaries are largely restricted to the import of fi nished goods from the parent company in India, sale of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash fl ows realized from sale of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The costs incurred by these subsidiaries are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The fi nancing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions.

## b) Basis of consolidation

## Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The fi nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated fi nancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. For the purpose of preparing these consolidated fi nancial statements, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company.

Joint arrangements (equity accounted investees)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Company has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic fi nancial and operating decisions.

A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

Associates are those entities over which the Company has signifi cant infl uence. Signifi cant infl uence is the power to participate in the fi nancial and operating policy decisions of the entities but is not control or joint control of those policies. Signifi cant infl uence is generally presumed to exist when the Company holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.

Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method (equity accounted investees) and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identifi ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest ("NCI") holders have certain signifi cant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in signifi cant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated fi nancial statements, the accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company.

## Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated fi nancial statements. Unrealized gains or losses arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Company's interest in the investee.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Acquisition of non-controlling interests

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the difference arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## Loss of Control

Upon loss of control, the Company derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or defi cit arising on the loss of control is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. If the Company retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as a FVTOCI or FVTPL fi nancial asset, depending on the level of infl uence retained.

## c) Business combinations and goodwill

In accordance with Ind AS 101 provisions related to fi rst time adoption, the Group has elected to apply Ind AS accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgment is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed. When the fair value of the net identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, the excess is recognised in equity as capital reserve. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the defi nition of a fi nancial instrument is classifi ed as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably. On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifi able net assets. Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination, such as fi nder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

Acquisitions of non-controlling interests are accounted for as transactions with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. The difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.

## d) Current and non current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.

## Assets:

An asset is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Liabilities:

A liability is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets/ liabilities include the current portion of non current assets/ liabilities respectively. All other assets/ liabilities are classifi ed as non current.

## e) Foreign currencies

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous fi nancial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash fl ows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## Foreign operations

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income/(loss) and presented within equity as a part of foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR").

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the presentation currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the presentation currency at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income/(loss) and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## f) Revenue

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

Revenue from sales of generic products in India is recognised upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company. Signifi cant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of generic products are transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. Clearing and forwarding agents are generally compensated on a commission basis as a percentage of sales made by them. Revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in India is recognised on delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories of the Company.

Revenue from export sales and other sales outside of India is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred to the customers, which occurs upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for specifi c revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised once all such activities are completed.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profi t share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profi t share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profi ts, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profi t share component is recognised as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profi t share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profi t share is available. Otherwise, recognition is deferred to a subsequent period pending satisfaction of such collectability and measurability requirements. In measuring the amount of profi t share revenue to be recognised for each period, the Company uses all available information and evidence, including any confi rmations from the business partner of the profi t share amount owed to the Company, to the extent made available before the date the Company's Board of Directors authorises the issuance of its fi nancial statements for the applicable period.

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive, or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to refl ect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition upon the expiration of limited competition or exclusivity periods. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better refl ect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be offered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## g) Interest income and dividend

Interest income primarily comprises of interest from term deposits with banks. Interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the fi nancial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the fi nancial asset. Interest income is included in other income in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Dividend income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

## h) Government grants

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signifi cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## i) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for fi nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profi t; differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realized simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefi t will be realised.

The Company recognises deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfi ed:

- a. When the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and
- b. it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealized inter-company profi t or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## j) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## k) Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefi ts embodied within the part will fl ow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life, whichever is shorter.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change(s) are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|                                            | Years    |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                  |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 to 50 |
| - Ancillary structures                     | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and equipment                        | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi ce equipment | 4 to 10  |
| Vehicles                                   | 4 to 5   |
| Computer equipment                         | 3 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date is disclosed as capital advances under other non current assets. The cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated.

## l) Goodwill and other intangible assets

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of identifi able net assets acquired.

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying value of the equity accounted investee.

## Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have fi nite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Subsequent expenditures are capitalised only when they increase the future economic benefi ts embodied in the specifi c asset to which they relate.

## Research and development

Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientifi c or technical knowledge and understanding are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditures are capitalised only if:

-  development costs can be measured reliably;
-  the product or process is technically and commercially feasible;
-  future economic benefi ts are probable; and
-  the Company intends to and has suffi cient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

The expenditures to be capitalised include the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditures are recognised as expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Payments to third parties that generally take the form of up-front payments and milestones for in-licensed products, compounds and intellectual property are capitalised. The Company's criteria for capitalisation of such assets are consistent with the guidance given in paragraph 25 of Ind AS 38 (i.e., receipt of economic benefi ts out of the separately purchased transaction is considered to be probable).

Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognised as intangibles assets under development. These assets are not amortized, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such assets is recorded as expenses in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Subsequent expenditure on an in-process research or development project acquired separately or in a business combination and recognised as an intangible asset is:

-   recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is research expenditure;
-   recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is development expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset; and
-   added to the carrying amount of the acquired in-process research or development project, if it is development expenditure that satisfi es the recognition criteria

Intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefi nite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets or on any other basis that refl ects the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefi ts are expected to be consumed by the entity. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortized from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|                                     | Years   |
|-------------------------------------|---------|
| Trademarks with fi nite useful life | 3 to 12 |
| Product related intangibles         | 5 to 15 |
| Customer contracts                  | 1 to 11 |
| Technical know-how                  | 3 to 13 |
| Other intangibles                   | 3 to 15 |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a fi nite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefi ts are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as on the date of de-recognition.

## m) Leases

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classifi ed as either a fi nance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under fi nance leases are apportioned between the fi nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The fi nance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

## n) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and fi nished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of fi nished goods and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares, that do not qualify to be recognised as property, plant and equipment, consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the allowance for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## o) Impairment of non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-fi nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefi nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defi ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash infl ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash infl ows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefi t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are alloca ted fi rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, and reversed if there has been a favorable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## p) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefi ts are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defi ned contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefi t plans and other post-employment benefi ts is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outfl ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefi ts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefi t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defi ned benefi t plan, recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in employee benefi t expense, refl ects the increase in the defi ned benefi t obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefi t changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefi t obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefi t expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefi ts are recognised as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefi ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.Termination benefi ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefi ts is the amount of future benefi t that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefi t is discounted to determine its present value. Remeasurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilize them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Equity settled share-based payments

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payments

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## q) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outfl ow of economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash fl ows at a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognizes any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outfl ow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Contingent assets are not recognised in the fi nancial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an infl ow of economic benefi ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## r) Financial instruments

A fi nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a fi nancial asset of one entity and a fi nancial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

## Initial recognition and measurement

All fi nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of fi nancial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the fi nancial asset. Purchases or sales of fi nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

-  Debt instruments at amortised cost
-  Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)
-  Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profi t or loss (FVTPL)
-  Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows, and
- b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specifi ed dates to cash fl ows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such fi nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in other income in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A 'debt instrument' is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets, and
- b) The asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassifi ed to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). The Group has not designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Equity investments

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS103 applies are classifi ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Group makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The classifi cation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fi nancial asset or part of a group of similar fi nancial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e., removed from the Group's consolidated balance sheet) when:

-   The rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired, or
-   The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the r eceived cash fl ows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement ; and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that refl ects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the Trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18.

For this purpose, the Company follows 'simplifi ed approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of simplifi ed approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classifi ed, at initial recognition, as fi nancial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All fi nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group's fi nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and deriva tive fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of fi nancial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss include fi nancial liabilities held for trading and fi nancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative fi nancial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defi ned by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profi t or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfi ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/ losses are not subsequently transferred to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The Group has not designated any fi nancial liability as fair value through profi t or loss.

## Loans and borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as fi nance costs in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an exist ing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modifi cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Venezuelan bolivars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles and Euros.

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivative fi nancial instruments) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non derivative fi nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifi es its derivative fi nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classifi ed to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash fl ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain/loss on such non derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassifi ed to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## s) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of our cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash fl ows.

## 1.5 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain fi nancial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specifi c to that asset or liability.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method after deduction of a fair return on other assets that are part of creating the related cash fl ows.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profi t margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and inter est cash fl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For fi nance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have fl oating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company witnessed a signifi cant decline in the expected cash fl ows of some of the products forming part of a cash genera ting unit ("CGU") under its Global Generics segment. Consequently, the Company, following the guidance under Ind AS 36 "Impairment of assets", determined that the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU is lower than its carrying cost. Accordingly, an amount of ' 335 (including ' 4 towards capital work-in-progress) was recorded as an impairment during the quarter ended 31 March 2017. The recoverable amounts of the above cash gener ating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Key assumptions on which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include: (i) Estimated cash fl ows for the r emaining useful life; (ii) Terminal value is considered to be zero; (iii) The post-tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital. The post-tax discount rates used was 6.68%. The pr e-tax discount r ates was 9.02%. Impairment loss pertains to the assets forming part of the Company's Venezuelan subsidiary. (Refer note 2.44) The Company has capitalised borrowing costs of ' 65 (31 March 2016: ' 51). The rate for capitalisation of interest costs for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 was appro xima tely 2.14% and 2.07%

## FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS

These fi nancial statements, for the year ended 31 March 2017, are the fi rst the Company has prepared in accordance with Ind AS. For periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company prepared its fi nancial statements in accordance with accounting standards notifi ed under section 133 of the Companies Act 2013, read together with paragraph 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (Indian GAAP).

Accordingly, the Company has prepared fi nancial statements which comply with Ind AS applicable for periods ending on 31 March 2017, together with the comparative period data as at and for the year ended 31 March 2016, as described in the summary of signifi cant accounting policies. In preparing these fi nancial statements, the Company's opening balance sheet was prepared as at 1 April 2015, the Company's date of transition to Ind AS. This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Company in restating its Indian GAAP fi nancial statements, including the balance sheet as at 1 April 2015 and the fi nancial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2016.

## Exemptions applied

Ind AS 101 allows fi rst-time adopters certain exemptions from the retrospective application of certain requirements under Ind AS. The Company has applied the following exemptions:

Ind AS 103, Business Combinations has not been applied to acquisitions, which are considered businesses under Ind AS that occurred before 1 April 2015. Use of this exemption means that the Indian GAAP carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, that are required to be recognised under Ind AS, is their deemed cost at the date of the acquisition. After the date of the acquisition, measurement is in accordance with respective Ind AS. The Company recognises all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a past business combination, except (i) certain fi nancial assets and liabilities that were derecognised and that fall under the derecognition exception, and (ii) assets (including goodwill) and liabilities that were not recognised in the acquirer's consolidated balance sheet under its previous GAAP and that would not qualify for recognition under Ind AS in the individual balance sheet of the acquiree. Assets and liabilities that do not qualify for recognition under Ind AS are excluded from the opening Ind AS balance sheet. The Company did not recognise or exclude any previously recognised amounts as a result of Ind AS recognition requirements.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS (CONTINUED)

Ind AS 101 also requires that Indian GAAP carrying amount of goodwill must be used in the opening Ind AS balance sheet (apart from adjustments for goodwill impairment and recognition or derecognition of intangible assets). In accordance with Ind AS 101, the Company has tested goodwill for impairment at the date of transition to Ind AS. No goodwill impairment was deemed necessary at 1 April 2015.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets balances were in compliance with Ind AS 16 and Ind AS 38, respectively with a retrospective effect.

The Company has not applied Ind AS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates retrospectively to fair value adjustments and goodwill from business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to Ind AS. Such fair value adjustments and goodwill are treated as assets and liabilities of the parent rather than as assets and liabilities of the acquiree. Therefore, those assets and liabilities are already expressed in the functional currency of the parent or are non-monetary foreign currency items and no further translation differences occur.

Cumulative currency translation differences for all foreign operations are deemed to be zero as at 1 April 2015.

Ind AS 102, Share-based Payment has not been applied to equity instruments in share-based payment transactions that vested before 1 April 2015. For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the Group has not applied Ind AS 102 to liabilities that were settled before 1 April 2015.

The Company does not have any arrangements containing a lease as defi ned under Appendix C to Ind AS 17, "Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease". Consequently, this exemption is not applicable to the Company.

## Estimates

The estimates at 1 April 2015 and at 31 March 2016 are consistent with those made for the same dates in accordance with Indian GAAP (after adjustments to refl ect any differences in accounting policies) apart from the following items where application of Indian GAAP did not require estimation:

-  FVTOCI - Quoted equity shares
-  Impairment of fi nancial assets based on expected credit loss model

The estimates used by the Company to present these amounts in accordance with Ind AS refl ect conditions at 1 April 2015, the date of transition to Ind AS and as of 31 March 2016.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.19 FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS (CONTINUED)

## a) Proposed dividend

Under Indian GAAP, proposed dividends including dividend distribution tax are recognised as a liability in the period to which they relate, irrespective of when they are declared. Under Ind AS, a proposed dividend is recognised as a liability in the period in which it is declared by the Company (usually when approved by shareholders in a general meeting) or paid. Therefore, the liability of ' 4,100 for the year ended on 31 March 2015 recorded for dividend has been derecognised against retained earnings on 1 April 2015.

## b) FVTOCI fi nancial assets

Under Indian GAAP, the Company accounted for long-term investments in quoted equity shares as investment measured at cost less provision for other than temporary diminution in the value of investments. Under Ind AS, the Company has designated such investments as FVTOCI investments. Ind AS requires FVTOCI investments to be measured at fair value. At the date of transition to Ind AS, difference between the instruments fair value and Indian GAAP carrying amount has been recognised as a separate component of equity, in the retained earnings, net of related deferred taxes.

## c) Mutual funds

Under Indian GAAP, investments in mutual funds are accounted for as short-term investments and accordingly they are carried at lower of cost and fair value. Under Ind AS, the Company has designated such investments as FVTPL investments. Ind AS requires FVTPL investments to be measured at fair value. At the date of transition to Ind AS, difference between the instruments fair value and Indian GAAP carrying amount has been recognised as a separate component of equity, in the retained earnings, net of related deferred taxes.

## d) Deferred tax

Indian GAAP requires deferred tax accounting using the consolidated statement of profi t and loss approach, which focuses on differences between taxable profi ts and accounting profi ts for the period. Ind AS 12 requires entities to account for deferred taxes using the balance sheet approach, which focuses on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base. The application of Ind AS 12 approach has resulted in recognition of deferred tax on new temporary differences which was not required under Indian GAAP.

In addition, the various transitional adjustments lead to temporary differences such as recognition of deferred tax impact on unrealised intra-group profi ts at buyer's rate. Deferred tax adjustments are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in retained earnings or a separate component of equity.

## e) Trade receivables

Under Ind AS, impairment allowance has been determined based on Expected Credit Loss model (ECL). Due to ECL model, the Group impaired its trade receivable by ' 57 on 1 April 2015 which has been eliminated against retained earnings.

## f) In-process research and development expenditure

Under Indian GAAP, in-process research and development expenditure does not qualify for capitalisation as intangible asset. Under Ind AS, such expenditure is allowed to be capitalised as intangible asset. As the asset is not available for use yet, it is not subject to amortisation. However, the same is tested for impairment following the guidance available under Ind AS 38, Intangible assets.

## g) Joint venture

The Group holds 51.33% interest in KRRP and exercises joint control over the entity. Under Indian GAAP, the Group has proportionately consolidated its interest in KRRP in the Consolidated Financial Statements. On transition to Ind AS, the Group has assessed and determined that KRRP is its joint venture under Ind AS 111, Joint Arrangements . Therefore, it needs to be accounted for using the equity method as against proportionate consolidation. For the application of equity method, the initial investment is measured as the aggregate of Ind AS amount of assets and liabilities that the Group had previously proportionately consolidated including any goodwill arising on acquisition.

## h) Reversal of amortisation of goodwill

Under Indian GAAP, the Company amortises goodwill over the period for which the Company expects to receive the synergies. However, under Ind AS, goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually. Accordingly, amortisation of goodwill for the year ended 31 March 2016 was appropriately adjusted to arrive at the profi t under Ind AS.

## i) Sale of goods

Under Indian GAAP, sale of goods was presented as net of excise duty. However, under Ind AS, sale of goods includes excise duty. Excise duty on sale of goods is included as part of sales in the face of consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Thus sale of goods under Ind AS for the year ended 31 March 2016 has increased by ' 842 with a corresponding increase in cost of material consumed.

## FIRST-TIME ADOPTION OF IND AS (CONTINUED)

## j) Defi ned benefi t liabilities

Both under Indian GAAP and Ind AS, the Company recognised costs related to its post-employment defi ned benefi t plan on an actuarial basis. Under Indian GAAP, the entire cost, including actuarial gains and losses, are charged to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Under Ind AS, remeasurements (comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defi ned benefi t liability and the return on plan assets excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defi ned benefi t liability) are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI. Thus the employee benefi t cost is reduced by ' 185 and remeasurement gains/ losses on defi ned benefi t plans has been recognised in the OCI, net of tax.

## k) Share-based payments

Under Indian GAAP, the Company recognised only the intrinsic value of the options granted as an expense. Ind AS requires the fair value of the share options to be determined using an appropriate pricing model recognised over the vesting period. An additional expense of ' 16 has been recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2016.

## EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of DRL (the "Committee") administer the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split effected in the form of stock dividend issued by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  RESERVED UNDER  CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  RESERVED UNDER  CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |

The weighted average grant date fair value of par value options granted under category B of the DRL 2007 Plan during the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 was ' 3,266 and ' 3,465, respectively. The weighted average share price on the date of exercise of options during the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 was ' 3,268 and ' 3,575, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the DRL 2007 Plan during the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 was ' 110 and ' 116, respectively. As of 31 March 2017, options outstanding under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 232 and options exercisable under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 17.

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company adopted a new program to grant performance linked stock options to certain employees under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan. Under this program, performance targets are measured each year against pre-defi ned interim targets over the three year period ending on 31 March 2017 and eligible employees are granted stock options upon meeting such targets. The stock options so granted are ultimately vested with the employees who meet subsequent service vesting conditions which range from one to four years. After vesting, such stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted under category B, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term, contractual term, as well as expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted under category A, the option life is estimated based on the simplifi ed method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions refl ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

## Gratuity benefi ts provided by the parent company

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a defi ned benefi t plan which provides for gratuity payments (the "Gratuity Plan") and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund") to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by Government of India, corporate debt securities and in equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 consist of the following:

The effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2017 was lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2016 primarily as a result of favourable orders from judicial authorities of India on previously litigated matter.

## d. Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities

The details of unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarised below:

| PARTICULARS                           | AS AT  31 MARCH 2017   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2016   |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Deductible temporary differences, net | 3,510                  | 855                    |
| Operating tax loss carry forward      | 3,061                  | 3,534                  |
|                                       | 6,571                  | 4,389                  |

During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company, based on probable future taxable profi t, has recognised previously unrecognised deferred tax assets of ' 128 pertaining to Octoplus N.V. Netherlands.

During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company did not recognise deferred tax assets of ' 2,182 on certain deductible temporary differences, as the Company believes that availability of taxable profi ts against which such temporary differences can be utilised, is not probable.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of ' 29,991 as at 31 March 2017, of subsidiaries outside India, where it is expected that earnings of the subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. Generally, the Company indefi nitely reinvests all the accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and accordingly, has not recorded any deferred taxes in relation to such undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. It is impracticable to determine the taxes payable when these earnings are remitted.

## e. Deferred tax assets and liabilities

The tax effects of signifi cant temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of the items that created these differences is given below:

| Investments                                        | (704)                               | (202)                               |

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefi ts of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Operating loss carry forward consists of business losses, unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed interest carry-forwards. A portion of this total loss can be carried indefi nitely and the remaining amounts expire at various dates ranging from 2018 through 2038.

Fair value hierarchy

Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).

Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

The models incorporate various inputs including foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves. As at 31 March 2017, the changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness assessment for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and other fi nancial instruments recognised at fair value.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk that arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Venezuelan bolivars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles and Euros. The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and currency swap contracts (collectively, "derivatives") to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

The counterparty for these contracts is generally a bank or a fi nancial institution. The Company had a derivative fi nancial asset and deriva tive fi nancial liability of ' 264 and ' 10, respectively, as of 31 March 2017 as compared to derivative fi nancial asset and derivative fi nancial liability of ' 176 and ' 107, respectively, as of 31 March 2016 towards these derivative fi nancial instruments.

Further, in respect of these foreign exchange derivative contracts, the Company has recorded, as part of foreign exchange gain and losses, a net gain of ' 699 and ' 231, for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, respectively.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifi es its derivative contracts that hedge foreign exchange risk associated with its highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded as a component of equity within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classifi ed in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is immediately recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as foreign exchange gain and losses.

The Company also designates certain non derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign exchange risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash fl ow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded as a component of equity within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classifi ed in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

In respect of the aforesaid hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions, the Company recorded, as a component of equity, a net gain of ' 968 and ' 972 for the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, respectively.

The Company also recorded, as a component of revenue, a net loss of ' 683 and ' 1,172 during the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, respectively.

The net carrying amount of the Company's "hedging reserve" as a component of equity before adjusting for tax impact was a gain of ' 129 as at 31 March 2017, as compared to a loss of ' 839 as at 31 March 2016.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of forward contracts and option contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The changes in fair value of the forward contracts and option contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised as part of "foreign exchange gains and losses".

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

The changes in fair value of such interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of fi nance cost.

As at 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of fi nancial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to refl ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Creditrisk

Credit risk is the risk of fi nancial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a fi nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<!-- image -->

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is infl uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an infl uence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating.The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signifi cant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

## Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certifi cates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2017. Of the total trade receivables, ' 27,813 as at 31 March 2017 and ' 34,840 as at 31 March 2016 consisted of customer balances that were neither past due nor impaired.

## Financial assets that are past due but not impaired

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The aging of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired is given below:

| PERIOD (IN DAYS)   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2017   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2016   |
|--------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 - 90             | 8,380                  | 5,151                  |
| 90 - 180           | 707                    | 577                    |
| More than 180      | 1,296                  | 682                    |
| Total              | 10,383                 | 6,410                  |

Other than trade receivables, the Company has no signifi cant class of fi nancial assets that is past due but not impaired.

On account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Company uses Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for assessing the impairment loss. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers.

## Reconciliation of allowance for credit losses

The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 are as follows:

## b. Liquidityrisk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its fi nancial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As of 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, the Company had unutilised credit limits from banks of ' 21,156 and ' 14,771 respectively.

As of 31 March 2017, the Company had working capital (current assets less current liabilities) of ' 12,638, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 3,865, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certifi cates of deposits having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 3,390 and investments in FVTPL fi nancial assets of ' 10,881.

## c. Marketrisk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive fi nancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in US dollars, Russian roubles, UK pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in US dollars, Russian roubles and Euros). A signifi cant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a signifi cant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fl uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non derivative fi nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency fi nancial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.33 above.

In respect of the Company's forward contracts, option contracts and currency swap contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- · a ' 1,154/(710) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an a ' 2,143/(2,287) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2017;
- · a ' 1,511/(424) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an a ' 1,277/(1,707) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2016.

The carrying value of the Company's foreign currency borrowings designated in a cash fl ow hedge as of 31 March 2017 was ' Nil. In respect of these borrowings, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such borrowings would have resulted in a ' 364 increase/decrease in the Company's hedging reserve as at 31 March 2016.

- (1) Others include currencies such as UK pounds sterling, Swiss francs and Venezuelan bolivars.

For the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned fi nancial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 316 and ' 416, respectively.

Further, in February 2016, the Venezuelan government announced changes to its foreign currency exchange mechanisms, including the devaluation of its offi cial exchange rate. Refer note 2.44 of these consolidated fi nancial statements for further details.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2017, the Company had ' 41,407 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate ranging from LIBOR minus 30 bps to LIBOR plus 82.7 bps and the Treasury Bill plus 30 bps. As of 31 March 2016, the Company had ' 29,552 of foreign currency loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of LIBOR minus 5 bps to LIBOR plus 125 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profi les, refer to note 2.8 A and B of these consolidated fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016, every 10% increase or decrease in the fl oating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 46 and ' 12, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certifi cates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

Commodity price risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate signifi cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fl uctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2017, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

- A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more signifi cant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected fi nancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case. The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its fi nancial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgments against the Company, such judgments could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Norfl oxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfl oxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfl oxacin. Under the Drugs Prices Control Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specifi ed product" and fi x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notifi cation and designated Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" and fi xed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company fi led a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fi xing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favor of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company fi led a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fi xed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest. The C ompany fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company fi led an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA fi led a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfl oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the fi eld. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

2.35

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fi xing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfl oxacin was fi led by the Company with the Delhi High Court. Such writ petition is pending for admission.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifi cations regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and anti-diabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, fi led a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifi cations issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition fi led by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to a few products of the Company for recovery of the allegedly overcharged amounts. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA fi led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the High Court dated 26 September 2016 on the grounds that certain information important for the determination of the issue was not disclosed by the counsel representing the Union of India during the proceedings before the Bombay High Court.

On 26 April 2017, the Bombay High Court heard the recall application and directed the matter to the same bench of judges of the Bombay High Court which passed the original judgement on 26 September 2016. Further, it also directed the Union of India and others to fi le their reply.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued demand notices to the Company relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. The Company has responded to these notices.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 374 under "other selling expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

In the event the Government of India pursues litigation against the Company on the aforementioned NPPA matters for the excess sales proceeds and the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Other Product and patent related matters

## Nexium United States litigations

Five federal antitrust class action lawsuits were brought on behalf of direct purchasers of Nexium®, and ten federal class action lawsuits were brought under both state and federal law on behalf of end-payors of Nexium®. These actions were filed against various generic manufacturers, including the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. These actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The complaints alleged that AstraZeneca and the involved generic manufacturers settled patent litigation related to Nexium® capsules in a manner that violated antitrust laws. The Company consistently maintained that its conduct complied with all applicable laws and that the complaints were without merit. In response to a motion for summary judgment made by the Company, the Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, fi nding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the Company's settlement of patent litigation with AstraZeneca included any large or unjustifi ed reverse payment, but preserving other claims for trial.

On 20 October 2014, the Company reached a settlement with all plaintiffs who had cases pending in the District of Massachusetts. The settlement with the class plaintiffs was subject to the Court's approval. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company made no payment to the class plaintiffs. Other defendants went to trial and prevailed.

The Court granted preliminary approval of the Company's settlements with the class plaintiffs on 28 January 2015, and granted fi nal approval of such settlements on 29 September 2015.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

On 21 November 2016, the First Circuit Court of Appeals affi rmed the judgment that had been entered in favor of the defendants who tried the case to a verdict. On 10 January 2017, the First Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motions for reconsideration.

In addition, two complaints, similar in nature to those referenced above, were fi led in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by plaintiffs who chose to opt out of the class action lawsuit. No dispositive motions have been fi led in these actions.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of lawsuits of the plaintiffs who opted out of the class action is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Child resistant packaging matter

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged in a letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the "CPSA") and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the "PPPA") and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Specifi cally, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certifi cates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC's allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") began to investigate a sealed complaint which was fi led in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") related to these same issues (the "FCA Complaint"). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the Company, have proceeded without the DOJ's and applicable States' involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company's generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging. The Company fi led its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and allowing the plaintiffs one more chance to refi le this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations. On 29 March 2017, the plaintiffs fi led their fi nal amended FCA Complaint, which the Company intends to vigorously oppose and seek permanent dismissal of this amended FCA Complaint with prejudice.

Although the DOJ and applicable States have declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint fi led by the plaintiffs, the parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ's offi ce in Washington, D.C. in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ relates to fi ve of the blister pack products. An unfavorable outcome in these matters could result in liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

## Namenda United States Litigations

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health & Welfare Fund ("Sergeants") fi led suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the Alzheimer's drug Namenda® (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009 until 2010. Sergeants seeks to represent a class of "end-payor" purchasers of Namenda® tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding Namenda® tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator's attempt to shift sales from the original immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product. The Company believes that the complaint lacks merit and that the Company's conduct complied with all applicable laws and regulations.

All defendants, including the Company, moved to dismiss the claims. On 13 September 2016, the Court denied these motions. However, the Sergeants case is stayed pending resolution of similar claims in another case in which the Company is not a party (JM Smith Corp. v. Actavis PLC). The parties in the JM Smith case have served the Company with subpoenas seeking specifi ed documents, and the Company has produced documents in response to the subpoenas. The parties have also served the Company with subpoenas seeking deposition testimony.

Four other class action complaints, each containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint, have also been fi led in the Southern District of New York. However, two of those complaints were voluntarily dismissed, and the other two do not name the Company as a defendant.

In addition, the State of New York fi led an antitrust case in the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set forth in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of alleged violation of federal antitrust laws is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint and another complaint (not a class action) were fi led against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifi cally, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets). The Company disputes these allegations and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were fi led against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fi x prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States. The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of any of these complaints is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") fi led a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for "udenafi l'' (a patented compound) and an udenafi l fi nished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and fi nished dosage forms of udenafi l and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the fi ling of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (ii) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action fi led a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Company believes that the likelihood of additional liability is remote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company along with the alleged polluting industries have challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

<!-- image -->

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-fi nding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notifi cation in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notifi cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (iii) Indirect taxes related matters

Distribution of input service tax credits

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various demand notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED                               | STATUS                                                                    |

| April 2013 to March 2014          | '  69 plus interest and penalties             | The Company has fi led an appeal before the CESTAT.                       |
| April 2014 to March 2015          | '  108 plus interest and penalties            | The Company is the in process of submitting an appeal  before the CESTAT. |

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2017.

## Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company has received various demand notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED        | STATUS                                                                                |

| April 2011 to March 2013          | '  16 plus 10% penalty | The Appellate Deputy Commissioner issued an order  partially in favor of the Company. |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 27 as of 31 March 2017, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 174. The Company has responded to such notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2017.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

## (iv) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions fi led by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. As of 31 March 2017, the Company has made "payments under protest" of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additi onal fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition fi led by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (v) Direct taxes related matters

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Indian Income Tax authorities disallowed for tax purposes certain business transactions entered into by the parent company with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The associated tax impact is ' 570. The Company believes that such business transactions are allowed for tax deduction under Indian Income Tax laws and accordingly fi led an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Authorities. On 28 April 2017, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal of Hyderabad issued a judgment in favor of the Company confi rming the Company's position.

Additionally, the Company is contesting various other disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 1,555. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavorable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and, accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2017.

During the years ended 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016, Industrias Quimicas Falcon de Mexico, S.A. de CV, a whollyowned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico, received a notice from Mexico's Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria ("SAT"), with respect to disallowance on account of transfer pricing adjustments pertaining to the calendar years ended 31 December 2006, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The associated tax impact is ' 647 (MXN 187.4 million) and the Company has fi led administrative appeals with SAT by challenging these disallowances. During February and March 2017, the Company received orders of the SAT confi rming the said disallowance by disposing administrative appeals fi led earlier. The Company disagrees with the SAT's disallowance and fi led an appeal with the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa (Federal Tax and Administrative Court of Mexico) in March and April 2017. The Company believes that possibility of any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as at 31 March 2017.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2017.

## (vi) Others

Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse ef fect on its fi nancial statements.

## COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH CURIS, INC.

On 18 January 2015, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited ("Aurigene"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent company, entered into a Collaboration, License and Option Agreement (the "Collaboration Agreement") with Curis, Inc. ("Curis") to discover, develop and commercialise small molecule antagonists for immuno-oncology and precision oncology targets.

Under the Collaboration Agreement,Aurigene has the responsibility for conducting all discovery and preclinical activities, including Investigational New Drug ("IND") enabling studies and providing Phase 1 clinical trial supply, and Curis is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory and commercialisation efforts worldwide, excluding India and Russia. The Collaboration Agreement provides that the parties will collaborate exclusively in immuno-oncology for an initial period of approximately two years, with the option for Curis to extend the broad immuno-oncology exclusivity.

As partial consideration for the collaboration, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 18 January 2015, Curis issued to Aurigene 17,120,131 shares of its common stock, representing 19.9% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to the transaction (approximately 16.6% of its outstanding common stock immediately after the transaction). Such shares were initially subject to a lock-up agreement. However, as of 31 March 2017, lock-up restrictions were released on all of the aforementioned 17,120,131 shares. In connection with the issuance of such shares, Curis and Aurigene entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated 18 January 2015 which provides for certain registration rights with respect to resale of the shares. The common stock of Curis is listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Global Market.

The fair value of the shares of Curis common stock on the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement was ' 1,452 (US$ 23.5 million).

Revenues under the Collaboration Agreement consist of upfront consideration (including the shares of Curis common stock) and the development and commercial milestone payments described below, which are deferred and recognised as revenue over the period for which Aurigene has continuing performance obligations.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene is entitled to development and commercial milestone payments as follows:

- · for the fi rst two programs: up to US$ 52.5 million per program, including US$ 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any;
- · for the third and fourth programs: up to US$ 50 million per program, including US$ 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any; and
- · for any program thereafter: up to US$140.5 million per program, including US$ 87.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any.

In addition, Curis has agreed to pay Aurigene royalties, ranging between high single digits to 10%, on its net sales in territories where it commercializes products. Furthermore, Aurigene is entitled to receive a share of Curis' revenues from sublicenses, which share varies based upon specifi ed factors such as the sublicensed territory, whether the sublicense revenue is royalty based or non-royalty based and, in some cases, the stage of the applicable molecule and product at the time the sublicense is granted.

On 7 September 2016, the Collaboration Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance to Aurigene of 10,208,333 additional shares of Curis common stock in lieu of receiving up to US$ 24.5 million of milestone and other payments from Curis that could have become due under the Collaboration Agreement. These shares of Curis common stock are recorded at US$ 1.84 per share, which is equal to the market price of such shares of common stock on the date of issuance, amounting to an aggregate market value of ' 1,247 (US$ 18.8 million).

These additional shares are also subject to a lock-up agreement, which is similar to the lock-up for the original Curis shares the Company received. However, this lock-up remains effective until 7 September 2018, with shares being released from such lock-up in 25% increments on each of 7 March 2017, 7 September 2017, 7 March 2018 and 7 September 2018, subject to acceleration of release of all the shares in connection with a change of control of Curis. As of 31 March 2017, lock-up restrictions were released on an aggregate of 2,552,083 of such additional shares of Curis common stock, representing 25% of the shares which Aurigene received from Curis in 2016.

The Company has evaluated the transaction under Ind AS 28, "Investments in associates and Joint Ventures," and believes that the Company does not have any signifi cant infl uence with respect to Curis. Accordingly, all of the shares of Curis common stock are classifi ed as investmnets at fair value through OCI at every reporting date. Accordingly, gain of ' 2,228 arising from changes in the fair value of such shares of common stock was recorded in other comprehensive income as of 31 March 2017.

This arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation under Ind AS 111.

## VENEZUELA OPERATIONS

Dr. Reddy's Venezuela, C.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is primarily engaged in the import of pharmaceutical products from the parent company and other subsidiaries of the Company and the sale of such products in Venezuela.

## Overhaul of the exchange rate system in Venezuela

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government launched an overhaul of its then existing exchange rate system and introduced a new exchange rate mechanism. The Marginal Currency System (known as "SIMADI") was the third tier in the new three-tier exchange rate regime and allowed for legal trading of the Venezuelan bolivar for foreign currency with fewer restrictions than other mechanisms in Venezuela (CENCOEX and SICAD). The new second tier (known as "SICAD") was introduced with an initial rate of 12 VEF per US$ 1.00. The fi rst tier (known as "CENCOEX"), the offi cial exchange rate, was unchanged and sold dollars at 6.3 VEF per US$ 1.00 for preferential goods.

In February 2016, the Venezuelan government announced further changes to its foreign currency exchange mechanisms, including the devaluation of its offi cial exchange rate. The following changes became effective as of 10 March 2016:

-  The CENCOEX preferential rate was replaced with a new "DIPRO" rate. The DIPRO rate is only available for purchases and sales of essential items. Further, the preferential exchange rate was devalued from 6.3 VEF per US$ 1.00 to 10 VEF per US$ 1.00.
-  The SICAD exchange rate mechanism, which last auctioned US$ for 13 VEF per US$ 1.00, was eliminated.
-  The SIMADI exchange rate mechanism was replaced with a new "DICOM" rate, which governs all transactions not subject to the DIPRO exchange rate and will fl uctuate according to market supply and demand. As of 31 March 2016, the DICOM exchange rate was 272.5 VEF per US$ 1.00.

During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Company received approvals from the Venezuelan government for remittance of only US$ 4 million towards the importation of pharmaceutical products at the CENCOEX preferential rate.

The Company fully considered all the aforesaid developments, facts and circumstances and, following the guidance available in Ind AS 21, determined that it was appropriate to use the SIMADI/DICOM rate for translating the monetary assets and liabilities of the Venezuelan subsidiary as at various reporting dates. Tabulated below was the impact of the foregoing on the fi nancial statements of the Company as at 31 March 2015 and 2016:

| PARTICULARS                                                                                                                     | FOR THE YEAR ENDED  31 MARCH 2015   | FOR THE YEAR ENDED  31 MARCH 2016   |

## Update during the year ended 31 March 2017

Revenues for the year ended 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2016 were ' 17 (VEF 162 million) and ' 4,666 (VEF 457 million), respectively. During the year ended 31 March 2017, the Company received approvals from the Venezuelan government to repatriate US$ 0.4 million at the preferential rate of 10 VEF per US$ 1.00.

Consistent with the position taken as on 31 March 2016, the Company applied the DICOM rate for translating the fi nancial statements of the Venezuelan subsidiary for the year ended 31 March 2017. As a result, foreign exchange loss of ' 41 was recognised for the year ended 31 March 2017. As of 31 March 2017, the DICOM rate was VEF 707.95 per US$ 1.00. Notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainty, the Company continues to actively engage with the Venezuelan Government and seek approval to repatriate funds at the preferential rate.

The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specifi c guidance to measurement of cash-settled awards, modifi cation of cash-settled awards and awards that include a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes.

It clarifi es that the fair value of cash-settled awards is determined on a basis consistent with that used for equity settled awards. Market-based performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are refl ected in the 'fair values', but non-market performance conditions and service vesting conditions are refl ected in the estimate of the number of awards expected to vest.Also, the amendment clarifi es that if the terms and conditions of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modifi ed with the result that it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction, the transaction is accounted for as such from the date of the modifi cation.

Further, the amendment requires the award that includes a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes to be treated as equity-settled in its entirety. The cash payment to the tax authority is treated as if it was part of an equity settlement.

The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the aforementioned requirement on the fi nancial statements of the Company.
