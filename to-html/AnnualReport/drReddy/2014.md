## HEALTHY FOREVER

<!-- image -->

Aff ordable healthcare for the world is a mission we have dedicated ourselves to, since inception. However, as the world around us changes, the means to achieving our mission must evolve at every step. It is important that we build the necessary capabilities and competencies that are aligned to emerging and unmet medical needs across the globe.

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

With this realization, we decided to fi rmly focus on getting diffi cult to produce medicines fi rstto-market. This is in step with the strategic priorities we have outlined for ourselves.

In FY2014, we not only reported excellent numbers but took eff ective steps towards fulfi lling our priorities. We tasked ourselves with identifying the right products to focus on and building capabilities across our businesses. We strengthened our R&D infrastructure to remain ahead of the curve and worked on creating the relevant scale for manufacturing. And, we are developing a talented workforce who can drive our vision from the ground up. We believe these three initiatives will help bring our mission to life.

## Chairman's Letter

<!-- image -->

## DEAR SHAREHOLDERS,

I am pleased to share with you the fi nancial and operational results of our Company for FY2014. In a nutshell:

- Consolidated revenue was ' 132.2 billion - up 13.7% over the previous year. In US$ terms, this amounted to US$ 2.20 billion.
- Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew by 19.3% to ' 33.2 billion, amounting to 25% of consolidated revenue.
- Profi t before taxes (PBT) was ' 26.6 billion - which was a growth of 22.7% over the previous year. In US$ terms, it was US$ 443 million.
- Profi ts after tax (PAT) was ' 21.5 billion - an increase of 28.2% over the previous year and was at 16% of consolidated revenue.

The high point has been the 27.4% growth in revenue from Global Generics in FY2014, which stood at ' 105.2 billion. This was driven largely by North America and the emerging markets. The low point was the 21.9% decline in revenue from Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI), which reduced to ' 24 billion in the course of the year. This was due to lower demand from several major customers coupled with a fewer launches compared to the previous year. Hopefully, PSAI's performance will improve substantially in the coming year.

<!-- image -->

Profi t is important. But to my mind, it is an enabler and not an end in itself. Ultimately, the raison d'etre of your Company is to continuously improve patient care and do so by providing innovative and aff ordable medicines across the globe. I look at performance through the lens of that fundamental objective.

Though we have miles to go to become one of the best in the world in meeting this objective, I have the satisfaction of saying that we are making good progress on this front. Consider, for instance, your Company's performance in North America Generics in FY2014. A growth in revenue of over 46% to ' 55.3 billion was mostly on account of your

Company successfully introducing innovative and limited competition products to meet critical unmet medical needs.

In the course of the year, nine new products were launched in North America. The major ones were (i) decitabine, a complex injectable to treat blood cell disorders including acute myeloid leukemia; (ii) azacitadine, also for blood cell and bone marrow cancer; (iii) zolendronic acid, to prevent osteoporosis; (iv) divalproex extended release, for treating seizures and epilepsy; and (v) donepezil 23 mg, to treat patients with dementia. These types of highly specialized medicines - be they in oral forms or in injectable dosages - were not produced by Dr. Reddy's earlier. Thanks to systematic investments in R&D and better organization of both intellectual property rights as well as the planning of a pipeline of specialized products, your Company can today provide tough-to-make generics to patients all over the world.

During FY2014, Dr. Reddy's R&D expenses amounted to ' 12.4 billion - an increase of 62% over the previous year and amounting to 9.4% of sales. This is an essential ingredient for growth and the basis for your Company to create innovative medicines that meet unmet patient needs.

I am happy to inform you that FY2014 also saw 13 product fi lings in the USA. Cumulatively, 62 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) are pending for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Of these, 39 are Para IVs - out of which we believe nine have 'First to File' status. These are the pathway to state-of-the-art growth.

What is my vision for your Company? A company which was founded and nurtured by a scientist of the caliber of Dr. K Anji

Reddy. Your Company should be able to steadily introduce a large number of diffi cult to produce, innovative medicines - oral formulations, injectables or biosimilars - and do so year after year. We should be among the global best in R&D and new product development. We should have manufacturing facilities that not only pass the most stringent tests by global regulatory agencies but are also recognized as outstanding in their engineering, design, quality, health and safety and margins. We should have best in class employees that work together in a positive, engaging environment to create an enterprise that each is proud of. And together, our Company should be known as a nimble, innovative provider of medicines that address critical yet unmet medical needs and, in doing so, earn greater returns for our stakeholders.

Are we there? Not yet. Are we getting there? I believe that we are. With more confi dent and determined steps with every passing year.

My belief is that we will see an even better FY2015. We have all the ingredients in place. We need to make them work as I believe we shall.

Thank you for your support. The management, the Board of Directors and I cherish it very much.

With warm regards,

## GLOBAL GENERICS

Our Generics products make aff ordable healthcare a reality. We achieve this by bringing expensive medicines within the reach of patients by reducing the cost of therapy. Global generics is our biggest business driver. We off er over 200 highquality and reasonably priced generic versions of expensive innovator medicines by leveraging our integrated operations. Our knowledge of active ingredients, product development skills, research-led understanding of regulations and intellectual property rights as well as our streamlined supply chain makes us a leader in this segment.

## BIOLOGICS

Biologics represent the next step in the evolution of modern medicine where

medicines are produced from living organisms and biological processes using biotechnology. At Dr. Reddy's, we were quick off the block to build capabilities for this eventual reality.

Large-molecule protein therapies, Biologics are extremely eff ective in treating complex diseases such as cancer and diabetes. These medicines are highly targeted with fewer side eff ects, but are very expensive. Our generic biosimilars off er aff ordable yet equally eff ective alternatives to their innovator versions. Our product development capabilities and commercial reach have made us a global leader in this industry with four products in the market and an industry-leading pipeline spanning oncology, nephrology and auto-immune diseases.

<!-- image -->

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES & ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

## ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICALS INGREDIENTS

We believe the trust of patients in our medicines needs to be continuously reinforced. Therefore, we endeavor to create high-quality Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), enabling our customers to create end formulations for patients that are eff ective and safe.

As we push the envelope further and strive for excellence, our eff orts have already paved the way for credible achievements. We have emerged as one of the world's largest producers of APIs and help innovator companies launch their products fi rst in the market. Apart from helping customers capture market opportunities at the earliest, APIs also help our own generics business reach consuming markets faster and become cost-competitive.

## CUSTOM PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES

We have one of the largest customized pharmaceutical businesses in India. We off er other generics companies and innovator fi rms pre-clinical and commercial supply capabilities. We bring a range of technology platforms and product services at competitive costs. We have a track record of bringing innovations to the market quickly, effi ciently and economically, thereby addressing patients' needs better and faster.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS

Our Proprietary Products business provides innovative medicines that increase patient's comfort and convenience. This business develops and markets new formulations of currently marketed drugs or combinations of complementary drugs and technologies to enhance safety or effi cacy or both.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW/ CORPORATE OVERVIEW

## Working closely with cross-functional teams across every domain, we developed a solution for an acute need, where the existing drug was an issue in itself!

## THE NEED

Metformin is the fi rst in line medicine for the treatment of patients suff ering from Type-2 diabetes. The pill is very big and hence uncomfortable to swallow. But it had come to be accepted by doctors and patients, given that there was no alternative. However, our survey on drug usage showed some patients were skipping the medicine while a large number were breaking the pill in half to get it down more easily. This is not advisable as it may aff ect the medicine's dissolution pattern.

## WHAT WE DID

Since 1989, many companies had been attempting to make a smaller version of the pill but few had succeeded. The major technical hurdle was reducing the size while ensuring the right quantity of the drug was available in the blood stream. Investment in R&D for Metformin was also lean considering that it was an 'economical drug'. Recognizing a silent need that many had overlooked, we decided to create a smaller pill that still packed in the same impact. We did this by working together with our R&D, formulations, IP and marketing teams. They came up with Metsmall Â® , named after the solution and we got it to market at the earliest.

## THE IMPACT WE HAD

33% reduction in size; 36% reduction in weight*.

Metsmall Â® was born. A smaller version of Metformin, the pill works with the patient, putting their needs and comfort fi rst.

* for MetsmallÂ® 500 mg

Patients fi nd it easier to take Metsmall Â® and thus manage their disease eff ectively on a daily basis - reassuring their family and their doctors, who now can confi dently prescribe a drug they know their patients will not miss taking.

Small, sometimes, is truly big.

Global R&D and Product and Technology Development Centers

9.4 %

of Total Sales in FY2014 invested in R&D

TOP: IPDO at Hyderabad, India

At Dr. Reddy's, we believe tomorrow's innovative solutions are the outcome of today's research and development (R&D) eff orts. Therefore, we have invested generously in expanding our Research & Development capabilities to lay a fi rm foundation for sustained eff orts in this area. We showcase below a brief insight into our focus on growing our R&D backbone.

## ONE TO MANY

We successfully progressed from a single site R&D organization to multiple sites, because we believe in tapping excellence wherever it is. Currently, we have eight R&D, Product and Technology Development Centers across the globe - one in Cambridge, UK, another being developed in Princeton, US, a third

in The Netherlands, four in Hyderabad and one in Bangalore, India. The multilocational R&D strategy has empowered us to deliver solutions across therapeutic areas, irrespective of geographical boundaries.

Sensing, and identifying opportunities in diff erent markets, we expanded from an Oral

<!-- image -->

Solid Dosages (OSD) only portfolio to include diversifi ed dosage development capabilities for the manufacture of Injectables and Topicals.

## COMPLEXITY IS THE KEY

The barometer of complexity is increasing across the world. We are consciously moving towards large diffi cult to produce molecules in order to target fi rst-to-market tough to make products. Therefore, our eff orts are focused on fostering the twin capabilities of developing complex products as well as developing them at a rapid pace to be the fi rst to market.

## VALUE THROUGH INNOVATION

Our Product Development team has a unique repertoire of skills to crystallize the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) using diff erent process parameters. This enables us to develop unique polymorphs which are diff erent from those patented by the innovator. We have also built infrastructure, which allows us to screen polymorphs in a

high throughput mode. A lot of the fi lings that we do today in the API business are novel polymorphs.

A world-class Advanced Characterization Technology Lab (ACT Lab) with cutting-edge characterization tools and best-in-class talent, both sourced from outside India, was also put together last year. This lab houses cutting edge tools like electron microscopes and Advanced Spectroscopy facilities.

## DERIVING VALUE FROM CATALYSTS

Our Chirotech facility in Cambridge is a Center for Excellence in Catalysis. It was originally aligned to our CPS business and worked for external customers, typically innovator companies. Today, Chirotech is aligned to our API business and has made substantial progress in helping the development of our APIs. This change in organizational structure has had a signifi cant infl uence on our ability to make cost-eff ective complex products, along with speed of development.

## Proprietary Products Innovation with a lower risk

In our Proprietary Products business, we are pursuing an innovative R&D approach with a lower risk by targeting specifi c segments of patients in Dermatology and Neurology. We intend to develop and take these products all the way to the patient ourselves and complement them with patientoriented solutions that can further improve the treatment outcomes for these patients. We have more than 15 products at diff erent developmental/ clinical stages with a peak sales potential from USD 30 mn to 300 mn. Two products are in advanced clinical trials between Phase II and Phase III and we expect to fi le our fi rst NDA in the next two years.

## Biologics Business of the future

Biologics is an exciting future opportunity for us as a large number of biotech drugs (USD 75-85 billion) are coming off patent in 2020. Our current biologics portfolio covers most of the top biologics coming off patent. In addition, we also entered into an alliance with Merck Serono, a division of Merck KGaA, Germany, in 2012 to co-develop a portfolio of biosimilar compounds in oncology; primarily focused on Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs). It covers co-development, manufacturing and commercialization of the compounds globally, with some specifi c country exceptions. This alliance maximizes the complementary capabilities and assets of both companies and off ers a riskmitigation pathway for us to take our development capabilities through the clinical phase and then into commercialization.

## STRATEGIC EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS

We began the journey of external development through partnerships with partners and have since completed six fi lings. We partner with those who have expertise and yet require handholding to make the association mutually rewarding. Our strategic analytical methods and validation tools ensure that we reach the fi nal fi ling stage of the product and continue to consolidate our leadership position.

## DEDICATED SYNERGIES

Our acquisition of OctoPlus in 2013 refl ects insight, as well as an ability to leverage our strengths exponentially. OctoPlus is a specialty research facility in the Netherlands, focused on the formulation development and cGMP manufacturing of controlled release and other complex injectable therapeutics. While we understood the process of making generic products and fi ling them, OctoPlus had the unique capability of enclosing toxic drugs in a matrix that then makes them safe

to be directly injected into the human blood stream. As OctoPlus had never developed generic products (end-to-end), our expertise matched their capabilities perfectly and in turn allowed us to expand our off erings.

## IT DRIVES BUSINESS INTEGRATION

At Dr. Reddy's, our IT investments are turning out to be a key diff erentiator in our endeavor to bring access to good healthcare to patients globally. Electronic Lab Notebooks were introduced in our R&D facilities which ensure that every single experiment/study done in the labs is centrally documented. They also connect the development team with other crossfunctional teams in a seamless manner. The result: uninterrupted workfl ow, better progress visibility at all organizational levels, eff ective documentation, and paperless operations. Besides, this IT architecture also addresses the quality and compliance parameters with speed, because approvals

of reports happen electronically. This is fully compliant with CFR 11, which is an FDA mandate and aids the process of development and documentation of products in our organization.

<!-- image -->

CORPORATE OVERVIEW/ CORPORATE OVERVIEW

We are ensuring that patients in a geography like Russia, with diffi cult weather and terrain and lack of infrastructure, do not have to worry about medicine availability.

## THE NEED

Medicine distribution to rural and remote locations is especially complex in Russia, given the existing weather and terrain conditions. It can take up to thirty days for supplies to reach their destination from Moscow. A complete stock-out situation is serious and needs to be avoided at all cost.

We work closely with Russian distributors to help avoid these situations - empowering them with information and capabilities to get drugs to patients, always. Working closely with our retail partners, we designed a fully-integrated approach to stock management, enabled through innovative technology, to ensure that patients never go without medicine.

## WHAT WE DID

We created deep, collaborative relationships with our channel partners to give them what they need, to be eff ective distributors in their localities.

In line with this approach, we tied up with a technical partner to set up a replenishment tool. Using technology, we assessed distributors' inventory and sales data on a daily basis, allowing us to react instantly to shortages in the system. By establishing a synchronized supply chain and integrating our systems - sales, supply chain and IT - we became true partners to distributors, understanding their stock needs, refi lling their warehouse and seldom leaving patients without medicines.

## THE IMPACT WE HAD

Shortages were halved. Inventory turns were doubled.

Not only did our eff orts enable our partners to increase their effi ciency and profi tability, but helped them respond to the exact need-profi le of patients in a way that was not possible before.

## Building World-Class Manufacturing Capabilities

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

New Manufacturing Facilities at API Srikakulam Plant (SEZ), Formulations Srikakulam Plant (SEZ), Formulations Vizag SEZ (Plant 1 & Plant 2)

We are focused on rapidly scaling up our manufacturing capabilities to keep pace with the progress in R&D initiatives. And it is not just about growing in volume terms, but also qualitative improvements. We present below a few of the salient initiatives.

## FOCUSED ON STANDARDIZATION AND AUTOMATION

Lack of standardized equipment in our R&D eff orts and the manufacturing process was a challenge for the longest time. Our engineering team spent signifi cant time to standardize the R&D and manufacturing equipment in all our new manufacturing facilities, thus enabling seamless and faster scale up. Our Product Development teams

also played a critical role making Product Development methods more automation friendly, minimizing human intervention. Dr. Reddy's API Srikakulam Plant (SEZ) is our most modern plant with signifi cantly enhanced levels of automation, minimizing human exposure to the production process.

## MAKING QUALITY MATTER AT EVERY STEP

At Dr. Reddy's, we have adopted the principle of Quality by Design (QbD). Our aim is to integrate quality monitoring processes at every step proactively. We have implemented Process Analytical Technology (PAT), which measures and monitors all online processes, ensuring product quality. In the manufacture of Oral Solid Dosages - a multiple unit operation, comprising mixing, granulation, compression and coating, PAT sensors in each process measure the product, as it moves from one unit to the other. We enjoy a signifi cant early-adopter advantage for this technology among generic companies.

## NEW OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

Our Operating Philosophy, in force, in all our new manufacturing facilities features new generation shopfl oor management practices like closed transfer systems, simplifi ed gowning, state-of-the-art equipment and better time and people management to maximize output. In-plant processes are based on maximum automation use, which entails less manual labor and more error-free results. For instance, at these plants, there is no manual recording of environmental conditions. The automated control system regulates and monitors ventilation, lighting, power systems, fi re and security systems of the plant. Similarly, Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) operations are guided by an automated environment monitoring system.

## BUILDING CORE COMPETENCE IN FERMENTATION - TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT CENTER (FTDC)

A FTDC was established at our existing Technology Development Center 2 to enter the fi eld of complex APIs that are fermentation derived and diffi cult to synthesize. Using fermentation, we will produce direct APIs or make core nucleus (intermediate), which can later be converted to fi nal API either by chemical or enzymatic process. About 28 scientists with experience in Strain development (conventional

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

mutagenesis and genetic engineering), process and Analytical development have been recruited for this facility. We can now carry out fermentation from a scale of 10L to 200L. FTDC has developed a novel platform for producing peptides of varying sizes, using recombinant approach with very short lead time, i.e. 2-3 months for Proof Of Concept (POC). Using this platform, POCs for three peptides have already been developed.

The SEZ Plant, with a capacity of 6-8 billion capsules and tablets in the next 3-5 years, is the latest addition to our OSD capacity, leveraging our knowledge of the platform. It is a next-generation plant with 'paperless manufacturing' capability through Electronic Batch Processing Record (eBPR) which automatically generates usage logs, ensuring 100% compliance and enhancing regulator confi dence.

CORPORATE OVERVIEW/ CORPORATE OVERVIEW

If this helps us build an empowered workplace which is better tuned to patient needs, this will become a win-win for all.

## THE NEED

The locations around our manufacturing facilities play an important role in our sustenance. Without their cooperation and support, we cannot function the way we do today. These localities are also home to a good number of young people in search of guidance and training to help them fi nd fulfi lling work.

The health eco-system the world over is changing. Patients are demanding access to better, high quality medicine at lower costs. We can achieve this only by investing in our human talent and building an empowered work force.

## WHAT WE DID

Young people from around our manufacturing operations are recruited to become a part of our Self Managed Teams (SMT) program. We provide them with the right training, appropriate tools and an enabling environment to help them build multiple skills to handle end-to-end jobs, so that they become an asset to our company. We have also tied up with local Pharmacy colleges and sponsor their professional training there, post which they are absorbed as full time employees of the company. Learning while they are earning gives them an opportunity to gain work experience and a professional qualifi cation simultaneously; thus helping them develop into well rounded professionals.

## THE IMPACT WE HAD

Our SMT program creates individuals who are an asset not only to our company but the healthcare eco-system as a whole. The SMT way of working creates a fl at organization with fewer hierarchies, thereby ensuring that those responsible for on-ground execution also remain connected with the purpose of the organization. Therefore, training and culture of the SMT program instills an innate, patient-centric perspective in them.

Over the course of three to four years, SMT recruits become highly skilled technicians in their fi eld, contributing signifi cantly to their family's sustenance. This also ensures that our medicines are made and delivered to patients with utmost quality.

## Harnessing People Potential

Manufacturing locations have SMTs

At Dr. Reddy's, we work together to drive positive health outcomes for patients in need of aff ordable healthcare. As an organization, we are driven by leadership, intelligence and motivated people. We continuously develop and support our teams, increasing their engagement and capabilities.

Today, Dr. Reddy's attracts and retains the best industry talent. With a presence in over 20 countries, we invest in various vocational and professional training for our people. We are building a talent pool to identify the right skills that will drive the organization ahead.

## EVOLVED HIRING FOCUS

Over the years, the hiring process has evolved to encompass two distinct levels. One, entrylevel hiring from foreign universities and category A universities within India to build and grow future capability in niche areas. Two, the lateral hiring from other domains by mapping key talent in specifi c areas and conducting a targeted selection process

to recruit the best-in-class talent. Apart from usual methods like industry mapping, employee referrals and headhunting through consultants and job portals, we are also actively engaging in forums like YIM to showcase our capabilities and attract Ph.Ds We are also targeting conferences like AAPS and ACS to network and hire the right talent.

## DRIVEN BY EXPERTS

We have recruited individuals both in the chemistry and engineering areas who will strengthen our capabilities. These experts will help counter tough challenges in chemistry and technological areas to make molecules that will drive growth. For instance, we have dedicated experts now working on synthesis of peptides. This has resulted in fi lings of complex molecules like Fondaparinux where complex oligosaccharides were developed internally. We have also recruited specialists who have worked on complex polymorphs for our particle engineering and polymorphism team. People with niche capabilities in fermentation and semi-synthetic technology were also hired for our new FTDC.

## PEOPLE DRIVING QUALITY THE QBD BLACK-BELTS!

The Quality by Design (QbD) Black-Belts, is a dedicated team of experts in our QbD initiative. Their role is to mentor the teams as they go through the entire feasibility and optimization process for developing APIs. We have also trained people to apply QbD in their own projects. This will allow us to have a robust process system, which can be scaled up eff ortlessly.

## EMPOWERING FOR GOOD

Empowering our human assets is an affi rmation of our larger commitment to the patients community we serve. Dr. Reddy's is an equal opportunity employer with a deep sense of responsibility for our people. With more than 600 Self-Managed Teams (SMT) members recruited at our API facility, we recently had an agreement with the Enhance Academy (an affi liate of Tata Institute of

<!-- image -->

Social Sciences - School of Vocational Education). The SMT Higher Education Program is the fi rst-of-its-kind in the country, where the industry has conceived a vocational education framework. We are also collaborating with the Andhra University to conduct B.Sc. programs for our SMT members in the distance mode for producing peptides of varying sizes, using recombinant approach with very short lead time, i.e. 2-3 months for Proof Of Concept (POC).

## BUILDING FUTURE LEADERS AND DIVERSE SKILL SETS

We are following a two-fold approach implementing the SMT way of working across all locations and building leaders at diff erent levels. Based on the philosophy of lead self, lead others, lead business , a three-tier program is structured with a duration of around 6-9 months. There is considerable focus on learning by doing at both the functional and leadership levels. We are also working on building diverse skill sets within our talent pool by bringing in people with specialized skills, be it in science, manufacturing, business management, sales or mergers and acquisitions.

Value proposition for attracting talent in R&D:

- Creating an environment of continuous learning
- Creating an environment of motivation through a culture of reward & recognition
- Capability building through exposure to some of the most up-to-date technologies in R&D
- Building a culture of scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing

CORPORATE OVERVIEW/ CORPORATE OVERVIEW

Being with the patient means developing a service to help them and their doctor navigate the journey of a complex treatment.

## THE NEED

As many patients of severe recalcitrant acne are young, adherence to medication can be a problem as it involves the FDA program, iPLEDGEâ¢. Therefore, while dermatologists believe isotretinoin is one of the most eff ective drugs for treating this severe form of acne, potential safety concerns and high costs make it very challenging for all patients to receive proper therapy. The potential severe side eff ects mean that it is important to counsel, monitor and guide the patient at every stage of the treatment regimen. In fact, based on an FDA review of the fi rst fi ve years of the iPLEDGEâ¢ program, over 400,000 attempts to fi ll isotretinoin prescriptions were denied due to failures to meet iPLEDGEâ¢ requirements.

## WHAT WE DID

Promius Pharma, our US subsidiary and the North American Generics team partnered to bring Zenataneâ¢ to patients through Promius Promiseâ¢. A customer-centric service, it provides information and frequent reminders while helping to reduce product cost for eligible patients through a co-pay off set. We have established a strategic relationship with an iPLEDGEâ¢ certifi ed pharmacy that receives and processes prescriptions and delivers Zenataneâ¢ to all iPLEDGEâ¢ eligible patients within 24 hours.

We have set up a 25-member call center to address queries and provide product updates and organized US$ 1 million savings for patients through automatically applied rebate.

People who are not capable of paying for therapy may qualify to receive the drug free of cost through a newly launched Patient Assistance Program.

## THE IMPACT WE HAD

Since we began the program in April 2013, 7,000 patients have been enrolled in Promius Promiseâ¢, with 99% receiving consistent treatment. Over 3,000 iPLEDGEâ¢ eligible healthcare providers are also involved in the program, which already represents 20% of the dermatologists in the US.

The program has eff ectively enabled patients and doctors to make the system work for them - making it more streamlined and as effi cient as possible.

TOP: Our Values Statement

## BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

We are the only generic company in the Green Chemistry Consortium of the American Chemical Society. We use a green matrix to manage the various aspects of product development, in accordance to the principles of Green Chemistry & Engineering.

A framework is in place to ensure that no complaint on harassment goes unheard. To this effect, we have set up an Apex Complaints Committee and regional Internal Complaints Committees (ICC) at our locations across India.

## Prevention of Sexual Harassment

We are committed to providing a work environment free from any form of Sexual Harassment for all our employees. A framework is in place to ensure that no complaint on harassment goes unheard. To this eff ect, we have set up an Apex Complaints Committee and regional Internal Complaints Committees (ICC) at our locations across India to investigate sexual harassment cases in line with Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013.

A sexual harassment policy has also been drafted and rolled out across the company. Manager awareness sessions were held and posters were put up across locations.

## Sustainability at the Heart

Sustainability guides all our business decisions and is integrated with our core business processes at two levels:

- at the corporate level, where overall policies and strategic directions are set and capital is allocated; and
- at the Business Group level, where revenue is generated and the impact on communities and the environment is most immediate.

## Transparency and Accountability

Relevant information is shared with our stakeholders through established systems and procedures. Our website (www.drreddys. com) is the primary source of information regarding our operations. Financial data is communicated through quarterly fi nancial result announcements and annual fi nancial reports, while our triple bottom line performance is presented through the Sustainability Report. In addition, various communication channels are deployed to reach out to our stakeholders. For detailed information on them, refer Principle 4 on Stakeholder Engagement (page 41).

## PRINCIPLE 2

## PRODUCTS LIFECYCLE SUSTAINABILITY

We think that our products are our means of bringing about sustainable change; that they

can fulfi l much more than their immediate objective of healing. Therefore, we continue to focus our energies on making our products aff ordable, accessible, eff ective, safer and more eco-sensitive. We have tried to embed 'Responsibility by Design' into every phase of our product lifecycle and bring about an operational transformation.

The key drivers of our journey towards product excellence include:

## Aff ordability and Accessibility

We are governed by our founding principle of 'Providing access to aff ordable medicine'. Our commitment to this principle is complete and set. We try to incorporate the tenets of Availability, Aff ordability and Accessibility in every aspect of our operations, from development to distribution. Our three core businesses - Global Generics, Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI) and Proprietary Products - help us realize this principle.

## Safety and Effi cacy

The safety of our products is the principal priority for us. This stems from the nonnegotiable nature of health and well-being of our patients. We are focused on removing 'quality and safety hazards' through advanced process engineering, globallybenchmarked equipment and industry-next manufacturing practices. In the past year, we undertook manufacturing automation to the extent possible to optimally minimize human contact and contamination.

The principles of Quality by Design (QbD) are being integrated into all our product development and manufacturing processes. This ensures that we get all our products right the fi rst time in terms of product effi cacy and compliance. We also have a highly vigilant Pharmacovigilance team that tracks and addresses any reported Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) across the entire life cycle of our products.

## Green Chemistry

Green Chemistry has empowered us to develop a number of new products using environmentally benign solvents that can

be disposed/recycled without any challenge. In accordance to the principles of Green Chemistry & Engineering, we use a green matrix to manage the various aspects of product development. We are the only generic company in the Green Chemistry Consortium of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

## Sustainable Sourcing

Our business partners form an important section of our stakeholder group. We value them and strive to nurture them by constantly presenting opportunities to enhance their capabilities through various training and knowledge sharing processes.

We also try to embed sustainable practices among our raw material suppliers, contract manufacturers and authorized business partners, as every action impacts the sustainability of every other member. We focus on four core aspects:

## Training

- Mandatory Supplier Induction Training for all new vendors
- Penetration of safety culture among our suppliers
- Periodic trainings on quality excellence

## Knowledge Sharing

- Sharing of best practices via audits and conferences
- Cascading the Supplier Code of Conduct
- Troubleshooting Labs and Support Labs for vendors

## Sustainable Logistics

- Focus on shifting vendors near the plant site
- Increasing sea shipments by 50%
- Introduction of new packaging solutions for cold chain products

## Conservation of Resources

- Reducing solvent usage and enhancing its recovery
- Cutting down repeated testing of raw materials, which have a stable track record
- Adopting Green IT practices for waste minimization and resource conservation

## PRINCIPLE 3

PROMOTING EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING

We believe high potential transforms into high performance through motivation, equal opportunities and a healthy work-life balance. We recognize that it is our people who help translate strategies from the drawing board to an on-ground reality. It is they who embrace challenges and bring about real change. Therefore, fostering a stimulating work culture that encourages, empowers and energizes people is important to us.

## Employee Composition

We are committed to building a rich and diverse workforce, without discriminating against culture, age, gender, caste, religion, language or ethnicity. Initiatives that help strengthen this diversity include inducting young talent, employing diff erently-abled individuals and enhancing the number of female employees. Employee selection is solely based on talent and merit. Today, 19,000 employees from more than 20 countries form our global workforce.

## BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

<!-- image -->

In 2014, we reinforced workforce diversity by recruiting 33% women during our campus recruitments.

## Talent Pool

We facilitate periodic enhancement of our employees' competence, skills and attitudes to help them keep pace with the changing environment and their evolving job profi les. Our people are trained, based on the improvement areas identifi ed during our rigorous talent review process. In the reporting year, 3,862 man-days of training was imparted at our Leadership Academy. Our employees also attended 140 external programs and 165 internal programs. Additionally, multiple technical training programs were conducted at various business units. We follow a structured Talent Management Process consisting of a threetier Talent Management Board (TMB). The TMB identifi es high potential employees and emerging leaders to groom them for greater responsibility.

## Performance Perks

A host of policies, facilities and incentives to enable our employees strike a healthy worklife balance, have been institutionalized. These include but are not limited to fl exible work timings, sabbatical leave, part-time work, paternity and maternity leaves and leave for those adopting a child.

'Well Done', an employee appreciation platform, was launched during the fi nancial year. It aims at fostering a culture of appreciation in the organization.

## Active Engagement

At Dr. Reddy's, employee engagement is a healthy two-way communication system. We empower our employees through communication platforms across regions and time zones. Some of these platforms include quarterly employee communication sessions, open houses at plants, 360Âº feedback and focused interviews.

We were recognized as the Best Place to Work in Biotech and Pharma companies in

India in Great Places to Work 2013 survey. We ranked 5 th among companies with over 10,000 employees and 26 th from the over 580 companies that participated in the survey.

## Freedom of Association

Our employees, including contract workmen, across operations enjoy freedom of association. We recognize their associations/ unions through a code of disciplines and negotiate on all matters pertaining to service conditions, leading to mutual benefi ts. We have recognized unions in eight of our manufacturing units in India and all permanent workmen in these units are members of the union. About 5% of our total workforce are members of the union.

## Beyond Work

We believe in mixing work with play, in sharing and celebrating our successes as a team. Various platforms are provided for employees to socialize at the corporate, business and unit levels. 'Celebrations', our annual employee event, promotes team spirit and celebrates inclusiveness. At the plant level, multiple cultural events and collective celebrations of successes and birthdays are hosted regularly.

A gymnasium at our corporate offi ce and sports facilities at some of our other locations ensure that our employees are fi t and healthy. Yoga classes are conducted at various locations including the corporate offi ce after work hours.

## Health and Safety

We adopt carefully-chosen manufacturing practices and processes to ensure safety of our workforce. 'Parivartan', our operations transformation exercise, is driving a new safety and quality paradigm across the organization. We intend to achieve a 'Safety Cultural Transformation' by demonstrating commitment to safety at all levels, line management ownership of safety and capability building in the area of safety.

Our journey has progressed well with safety standards improving signifi cantly and the

employees, subsidiaries and affi liates. A separate Supplier Code of Conduct has been drafted for our suppliers, vendors and service providers.

All individuals are treated with equal dignity at all our offi ces and plants. They enjoy equal rights and have the freedom to voice their opinion without any inhibitions. Harassment in any form is not tolerated. We do not employ nor encourage any child or forced labor at any of our locations. Anyone found to be engaged in unlawful discrimination is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. In the reporting year, no serious human rights violations were brought to our notice.

In case of new investments, we conduct human rights screenings and also have related assessments for strategic suppliers. Regular HR audits are conducted to ensure compliance with HR principles. Monthly meetings of HR heads from respective departments provide an ideal platform to articulate concerns, if any, and collectively propose and execute refi nements.

In the healthcare industry, awareness is not limited to the information printed on the packaging. It also involves managing social perceptions about medical conditions and demystifying myths and fears about them. We have many ongoing initiatives to help generate the right kind of awareness among people.

## PRINCIPLE 6

## ENVIRONMENT

We believe that climate change is a real and growing challenge for our planet. According to a recently published report (Climate Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change is adversely impacting the life and livelihood of millions of people, globally. Such a scenario, makes it imperative for governments and enterprises to work together to create a greener, cleaner world.

Hence, we work constantly to embed environmental sustainability right at

the design and development stage of our products. This approach helps us champion green endeavors that go beyond regulatory compliance. We are spearheading the uptake of Green Chemistry not just within the company, but also within the Indian pharmaceutical industry and the global generics space. Our wastewater recycling plant, commissioned in FY2005, holds the distinction of being the fi rst of its kind in India's pharmaceutical sector.

During the reporting year, 29 signifi cant environment management projects were initiated with an investment of ' 302 million. Detailed below are a few of the initiatives that are helping us raise our green quotient.

## Green Roadmap

Our Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Policy and Principles inspire our workforce to reduce environmental stress. They are also shared with all our stakeholders and eff orts are being made to make them responsible towards its compliance. We have also institutionalized an organization-wide Environmental Commitment Statement charting ambitious targets and actionable steps for key environmental performance indicators like a 5% reduction in specifi c water and specifi c energy consumptions.

Year-on-year, we assess each unit's progress on the said targets and strategize appropriate actions. The objective is to encourage and engage every employee to contribute towards making the organization greener, cleaner and sustainable.

Our Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) Research & Development (R&D) team has religiously adopted a Green Chemistry metrics system to map synthetic routes to ensure that all the calculated values regarding Atom Effi ciency in feasibility, stay constant all the way till commercialization. This system involves:

- Selection of the best environment friendly solvents, catalysts and reagents for the process
- Screening based on physiochemical attributes of solvents

- Optimizing process parameters and operations with energy effi ciency in mind

## Action against Climate Change

We are committed towards managing climate change both within and beyond our sphere of infl uence. A culture of conservation has been embedded in our employees and business partners. We continually implement initiatives on several green parameters like clean technology, energy effi ciency and renewable energy. During the year under review, 9% of total energy consumed was from renewable sources. We also participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) initiative, scoring a 76 in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index.

## Energy Consumption

Our belief is that the fundamental root of emissions is enhanced energy consumption. Hence, we strive to recreate and redefi ne processes that help us tread lightly.

During the year, we reduced energy costs by 8% at Chemical Technical Operations (CTO) from the FY2013 cost base by sourcing power at competitive rates from open access, sourcing coal from e-auction and implementing various energy conservation measures. We identifi ed an energy conservation project including a co-generation power plant with an annual savings potential of ' 240 million with a total investment of ' 620 million.

Additionally, various business units implemented energy conservation initiatives such as:

- Project resulting in savings of ' 3.6 million at our Custom Pharmaceutical Services (CPS) unit
- 24 energy conservation projects resulting in savings of ' 55 million at our Formulation Technical Operations (FTO) units
- Better sourcing strategy leading to savings of ' 14.9 million by our Biologics Development Center

We are also planning to implement rooftop solar power plants of 1.1 MW and 1.18 MW at our Bachupally and CTO-SEZ and Vizag

It has two main features: an itinerant poster exhibition and the editing of an album featuring the most representative fauna species. The exhibition was showcased in the principal cities at prominent locations in Romania. In the last two years, this initiative has garnered wide acclaim of the general public and our customers.

campuses, respectively, which will reduce 10% of grid power consumption.

## Waste Management

In continuation of our earlier practice of disposing organic waste to cement industries as auxiliary fuel, we have undertaken pilot studies to dispose market returned/off specifi ed pharmaceutical goods. To this end, we are working closely with regulators and cement industries to obtain necessary permits to commercialize the process. We have also taken several initiatives to manage the waste generated, including:

- Identifying specifi c waste stream from the Ranitidine manufacturing process to recover pure sodium sulphate salts (up-cycling)
- Installing a new onsite incinerator at FTO-4 to dispose hazardous waste accumulated over years
- Replacing the existing Spray Dryer at CTO-2 with ATFDs to comply with

directions from the regulator

- Enhancing solvent recovery under our program to achieve cost and capabilities

## Reduce

During the year, our eff ort to reduce environmental footprint was implemented through:

- Installation of 350 KLD RO systems to treat rejects from existing utilities and process ROs, reducing water consumption by 250 KLD at CTO-5
- Installation of an Electro Coagulation unit at CTO-5 to improve quality effl uents into RO systems and reduction of chemical consumption of up to 20 tons/month at CTO-5
- Replacement of small cooling towers with a higher capacity under our cooling tower consolidation initiative at CTO-6, resulting in a reduction of 80 KLD fresh water consumption

## BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

ISO 14001 Environmental Management System certifi ed units

We encourage our people to be vocal on issues they feel deeply about at public forums and help influence policy decisions. Our technical and commercial teams participated in many professional forums, including CII, IPA, Chapters of ICAI and industry round tables.

We replenished fresh water in our units by completing a rainwater harvesting survey at CTO-5 and initiating civil works for the construction of storm water drains.

- Condensate and seal water recovery at BDC CCM-2, resulting in a saving of 30 KLD of fresh water consumption

## Recycle

We continued our focus on recycling by installing a new 150 KLD ZLD facility in FTO-1, reducing our fresh water consumption by 25 KLD. Additionally, a new 350 KLD sewage treatment plant was commissioned in FTO-2, reducing our water footprint by 80 KLD.

## Replenish

We replenished fresh water in our units by completing a rainwater harvesting survey at CTO-5 and initiating civil works for the construction of storm water drains. We also carried out similar activities at FTO-1 to replenish rainwater with a sequestration potential of 150 KL.

## Air Quality

Managing air quality is on our development agenda. We already track particulate matter, NO x and SO x emissions and closely follow evolving norms on other pollutants, such as Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs). Our emissions generated are well within permissible limits fi xed by Central and State Pollution Control Boards (PCB).

Over the year, we installed continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations in three API manufacturing units to monitor quality of ambient air. Three more units are in the process of being installed. The results acquired from these units are directly logged into the Andhra Pradesh PCB server. Moreover, proactive continuous VOC monitoring stations are installed at CPS and three API units to improve the quality of ambient air.

## Compliance & Beyond

Four of our units are ISO 14001 Environmental Management System certifi ed. We are currently in the process of developing comprehensive internal corporate environmental standards and procedures, which shall provide a framework to:

- Assess potential environmental risks associated with our operations

- Prevent, mitigate and control environmental damage and possible disasters

Our achievements in setting benchmarks in environmental standards included:

- Receiving the Green Manufacturing Excellence Award by M/s. Frost & Sullivan for FTO-3, showcasing sustainable measures incorporated in our manufacturing processes
- Rolling out 21 safety and 2 environmental standards to achieve goal "zero" and reduce our resource footprint
- Participating in Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), earning a score of 76 in the assessment and being placed in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index

## Green Value Chain

To strengthen our position in the Green Value Chain, safety awareness sessions were held at the Leadership Academy with Strategic Business Partners (SBP) and Loan Licensing (LL) sites in November 2013. They covered:

- Good safety practices in the manufacture of intermediates and API Products
- Need, selection, use, limitation, maintenance and replacement of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE)
- Emergency Response (Identifi cation of Emergencies and their mitigation measures)

61 members, including plant head, Engineering and Safety personnel, participated in the training sessions from 27 SBP and LL sites.

Additionally, our Program to achieve Cost and Capabilities Excellence (PACE) initiatives during the year included:

- Recovering Acetone which was being sold as a spent solvent in the Clopidogrel EP grade. It was introduced in the CB 23 stage after necessary R&D trials. For Clopidogrel US grade, losses were addressed which resulted in more than 15% improvement in overall recovery
- Recycling Acetone used in Losartan for chasing purpose, where only fresh Acetone was used for manufacturing in ESE 24 stage previously, resulted

in a more than 50% reduction of total Acetone requirement. After the necessary RA approvals for use of recovered solvent in the API stage, the idea was implemented in October 2013

- Implementing process and facility modifi cations in manufacturing and SRS areas for the use of 2-Butanol in the CB 24 stage of Clopidogrel Bisulphate. The modifi cations resulted in substantial improvements in overall recovery and reuse of 2-Butanol
- Addressing vent losses in the manufacturing area and improved SRS to enhance overall recovery of Ethyl Acetate used in the LCM 1 and LCM 2 stages in Levitracetum at CTO-6. The ideas were implemented within a very short span of 2 months
- Addressing the loss of Tolulene through aqueous layer, condenser and other vent losses in Quetiapine (both CIP and non-CIP process) for improvement of recovery. The project was implemented in September 2013

These initiatives resulted in an overall savings of US$ 3.22 million.

## Changing the paradigms of rural education

We work to make education more accessible for India's rural children. We believe interventions (Scholarships for Higher Education, Coaching camps, Distributing learning tools) can improve school infrastructure and educational standards.

## Empowering Transformations through SMTs

As India's fi rst pharmaceutical company to implement a Self-Managed Team (SMT) initiative, we aim to provide employment to youth from economically disadvantaged communities. The recruitment strategy primarily focuses on rural and semi-urban areas, where employability is a challenge. These students earn, while they learn. Our team members are encouraged to pursue higher education on the completion of which they take on higher responsibilities and grow as professionals or entrepreneurs.

## Nation-wide Interventions

## Dr. Reddy's Foundation

Dr. Reddy's Foundation (DRF), the nonprofi t arm of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, acts as a social change agent, by identifying and pursuing new opportunities to serve the community in two core areas:

## LIVELIHOODS

Our livelihood programs work towards enhancing the employability of urban and rural youth.

- LABS - Our Livelihood Advancement Business School programs are developed for youth between the ages of 18 and 35, who have limited opportunities and inadequate skill sets. To enable these youth to gain a foothold in today's competitive job market, LABS equips them with job-specifi c skills, soft skills and placement linkages. Currently, DRF operates 75 LABS centers across 19 states and has generated over 2,92,834 livelihoods till date.
- Rural Livelihoods Program - In FY2014, 7,639 farmers benefi ted through 5,946 substantive interventions of this program.

- LABS-PWD - Our LABS-People With Disabilities (PWD) program was successful in generating 1,610 livelihoods during the fi nancial year.
- SRI (Skilling Rural India) - Our SRI initiative helps rural youth gain skills, which translate into rural employment generation, despite pressing problems like need for migration, poor income, isolation from family and village life, the tribulations of adjusting to an urban way of life and the poor retention rate. Apart from technical training, the SRI training module also comprises life skills training.

## EDUCATION

DRF strives to provide various opportunities for learning to those who have never been to school, or have dropped out. It also works to improve the quality of education in schools through diverse initiatives and programs. We work with a well-woven fabric of stakeholders, communities, offi cial institutions and schools to encompass children from all walks of life and to introduce them to mainstream education.

DRF's education initiatives include: Education Resource Centre (ERC) | Pudami Neighbourhood Schools and English Primaries | Kallam Anji Reddy Vidyalaya (KARV) | Special School for Homeless Children | Kallam Anji Reddy Vocational Junior College (KAR-VJR) | Yuva Youth Learning Centres | Non-Residential Bridge Centres (NRBCs) and Residential Bridge Centres (RBCs).

The world's fi rst-of-its-kind country-specifi c online repository on breast cancer (www.ibcr.in) helps facilitate cancer research by assimilating relevant information from various sources. In addition, the information platform maintains contributions from more than 60 oncologists from various parts of India. The insights focus on treatment strategies, side eff ects and management of breast cancer from the Indian perspective.

and accountability. Pharmacovigilance, Safety by Design, pharmacopeia adherence and bioethics are active ingredients in our product development formula.

The following steps help us ensure that we are worthy of the trust our customers repose in us:

## 360 o Safety Commitment

Whether products or processes - safety comes fi rst at Dr. Reddy's. We adhere to globally-recognized, safety benchmarks like the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines and have instituted a comprehensive safety assurance model that weeds out safety and quality hazards from the development stage of a product to its end distribution.

## Pharmacovigilance

The Pharmacovigilance (PV) and Clinical Management groups are key arms of our organization that guard our medicines against adverse eff ects, if any. The Pharmacovigilance team intervenes at an early stage, rather than acting as a watchdog.

We incorporate global Pharmacovigilance mandates across the entire product development lifecycle. We have put in place structured processes to monitor signals and events across the world and identify causeeff ect relationships. Toll-free numbers have been set up globally, in various countries, to facilitate the reporting of adverse events and a Drug Safety Assessment and Reporting team is in place to administer swift action.

## Addressing Counterfeit

Apart from IP infringements and reputation drain, counterfeit drugs are the biggest risk to a patients' health, besides causing huge sales losses to the healthcare industry. At Dr. Reddy's, we have deployed a robust process to prevent counterfeiting of our products. Some of the key systems and initiatives we have instituted to avert this breach include:

- Use of a specifi c sequence for batch numbering, manufacturing and expiry date

- Use of hologram stickers
- Employment of specialized printing techniques to safeguard products from cheap counterfeits
- Implementation of a coin reactive zone

## Customer Awareness

Medicines are a product category, where even a slight misappropriation of information could lead to fatalities. We ensure that this responsibility towards our customers is demonstrated throughout our marketing and promotional material and all information is provided in an unambiguous and precise manner.

At all times, we seek to engage with our customers in utmost transparency and accountability. We keep them updated about the composition and eff ects of our pharmaceutical products. Literature pertaining to promotional content or any Customer Relationship Management activity, scientifi c seminar and symposium, among others, undergoes a stringent authentication process by our Product Management and Medical Aff airs teams. Our Professional Sales Representatives (PSRs) undergo in-depth training to become well versed with product information and communication skills. Our in-house Medical Aff airs Team addresses queries from PSRs and doctors, regarding our products, within 48 hours.

During FY2014, over 21,000 man-days of training was provided to trainee Professional Sales Representatives (PSRs). Training Managers also provided On-Job-Training (OJT) to select PSRs as joint fi eldwork, amounting to over 500 man-days in FY2014. Additionally, over 4,500 man-days of training was provided to the fi eld force through various e-learning courses.

However, awareness in the healthcare industry is not limited to information printed on packages. It also encompasses social perceptions about medical conditions and debunking myths and fears related to them. Hence, we have multiple initiatives that help generate awareness among people.

PromOTE India is an initiative that encourages early detection, awareness and diagnosis, which helps prolong lives of cancer patients. The initiative works by connecting Oncologists and General Practitioners (GP), which in turn empowers GPs and other non-oncology doctors to detect cancer early. We also run 'Lymphoma Awareness', an interactive campaign on radio channels across India, where eminent oncologists address listeners' queries on the subject.

ROSHINI is an initiative to diagnose all undetected diabetic cases in India. Launched in November 2008, the initiative includes activities like glucose screening camps at doctors' clinics and talks at schools, which provide children information about diabetes, obesity, diet pattern and physical activities to help prevent diabetes.

## GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

- Revenue from Global Generics for FY2014 increased by 27.4% and stood at ' 105.2 billion - driven largely by North America and the emerging markets.
- Revenue from North America for FY2014 was ' 55.3 billion, recording a year-on-year growth of 46.1%.
- Growth was largely driven by key 'complex to make' products launched during the year. Nine new products were launched during the year; the major ones being decitabine, azacitadine, zolendronic acid (5 mg/100 mL), divalproex ER and donepezil 23 mg. There was also a signifi cant increase in the market share of key existing products such as metoprolol succinate and atorvastatin. FY2014 also saw 13 product fi lings in the USA. Cumulatively, 62 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) are pending for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Of these, 39 are Para IVs - out of which we believe nine to have 'First to File' status.

## OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

The global pharmaceutical market is expected to reach US$ 1.2 trillion in 2017, up from US$ 0.96 trillion in 2012, growing at the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5% over the fi ve-year period. 1

- Developed markets 2 will account for more than half of the business even in 2017, or approximately US$ 668 billion in value.
- Simultaneously, with a higher CAGR of around 11.6%, the pharmerging markets 3 will signifi cantly increase their share from 23% of the market in 2012 to 32% in 2017.

## Refer Chart A.

Over the next few years, diff erent factors will drive growth in developed and pharmerging markets detailed in Table 1 :

Another way to look at the growth of the global pharmaceutical market is the mix between branded and generic drugs. Here are the estimates the IIHI provides:

- The market for branded drugs is expected to grow modestly to reach US$ 620 billion in 2017.
- The generic drugs market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.5%, from around US$ 260 billion in 2012 to about US$ 430 billion in 2017.

- Generic medicines will meet a signifi cant part of increasing global demand, rising from a market share of 27% in 2012 to 36% in 2017.
- The share of generics is expected to rise everywhere: (i) in developed markets from 16% in 2012 to 21% in 2017; (ii) in pharmerging markets from 58% to 63%; and (iii) in the rest of the world from 27% to 31%.

## OPPORTUNITIES

## CHANGING DEMAND

Growth will arise from diff erent factors in the developed and pharmerging markets. Major factors shaping demand in developed markets include:

- The shift to generics: A large proportion of spending is steadily moving to generic drugs. In the US, 34% of 2012 brand spending, or US$ 83 billion in value, will shift to generics at substantially lower prices. In Canada, this proportion will be 30%. And in other developed markets, 22% of average brand spending will be exposed to generics competition.
- Increased access to medicines in the US due to healthcare reform: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the US aims to extend public and private insurance coverage to an increasingly larger share of the population. Once fully implemented, it will increase the access to medicines for the public, which should boost demand.

## CUSTOMER CONSOLIDATION

Major alliances between pharmaceutical wholesalers, distributors and retail chains across the US and parts of Europe will have an impact on demand pattern. These alliances will help large buyers to optimize generic drug purchases through wholesalers selling to distributors and manufacturers selling to wholesalers or distributors. While this trend will erode price points faster than otherwise, it is expected that manufacturers with reliable, high volume and high quality supply will get preferred status.

## AGEING POPULATION

Improving medical reach, increasing life expectancy and decreasing mortality along with declining fertility have created ageing populations in developed countries, as well as in some developing countries, such as China. Consider the facts depicted in Chart C.

In 1985, a year after Dr. Reddy's was founded, the number of people in the world aged 60 years or above was less than 433 million, or 8.9% of the global population. Two decades later, in 2005, the absolute number of people aged 60 years and above exceeded 672 million. This group now accounts for 10.3% of the global population. By 2025, this group will comprise almost 1.2 billion people, or 14.8% of the population. By 2050, there will be over 2 billion such people in the world, accounting for over 21% of the population. This major change will impact both the quantity and the pattern of medicine consumption.

## BIOLOGICS AND BIOSIMILARS

Increasing demand for biologic drugs will also drive growth in both developed and pharmerging markets. Medical science has substantiated that, where possible, 'living cell-based' therapy can be more eff ective than their chemical drug equivalents in treating complex diseases such as cancer and auto immune disorders. Growth in this sphere is expected to outpace overall pharmaceuticals growth to reach approximately US$ 220 billion in value, or to 20% of the total market value by 2017. This growth will be driven primarily by Monoclonal Antibodies (MAbs) and human insulin.

Though benefi cial, biologics are largemolecule drugs and are inherently complex to develop and manufacture. This increases the cost for innovator companies and makes treatment very expensive. Very few organizations in the world are capable of developing and making such products. This has begun to open the opportunity for biosimilars, i.e. generic versions of branded biologic drugs. Various developed and developing nations are working on biosimilars approval processes to decrease the cost of treatment.

Currently, biosimilars account for less than 1% of the total branded biologic drug spends in the developed markets and around 10%

of those in pharmerging markets. This will increase signifi cantly in the years ahead.

## INCREMENTAL INNOVATION

There is a recent trend in the industry wherein an increasing number of generic pharmaceutical companies are increasing their portfolio through incremental innovation to create new specialty products that address unmet patient needs. Typically, these are directed towards: (a) known molecules, or those with proven effi cacy, (b) reduced cost and risk of development, (c) shorter timelines and (d) off ering greater convenience and compliance over the existing options. Regarding IP protection in the US, these products are eligible for

## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

(i) three-year data exclusivity with effi cacy studies and (ii) seven-year orphan indication, where relevant.

In India, Dr. Reddy's has a similar business model of focusing on incremental innovation. On the global scale, Teva Pharmaceuticals has also announced a similar program.

## BUSINESS CONSOLIDATION

Regulatory pressure is building in pharmaceutical industry in terms of (a) development, (b) approval, (c) pricing and (d) cost containment. While the larger companies can access big pockets to combat these forces, the unreliable situation that relatively smaller fi rms face is aggravated by signifi cantly constricted credit. Against this backdrop, many pharmaceutical companies are turning to mergers and acquisitions as a way to bolster their pipelines and improve effi ciencies. This kind of inorganic growth has been quite prevalent in developed markets in the recent past. Now, although at a nascent stage, developing nations too are witnessing similar M&A trends.

## CHALLENGES

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY At the end of the fi fth year since the beginning of the global economic slowdown, macroeconomic indicators are improving, but at a slower than expected rate. Growth is minimal in developed countries and lowerthan-expected in developing nations. This has created uncertainty about how global and national economies will shape up in the future - which can directly aff ect healthcare spends as these form a large part of national budgets of almost all developed and some emerging market economies. Various policy approaches ranging from generic-drug preferences to reference or tender-driven pricing models have come into play. These are expected to intensify, with their corresponding impact on the global pharmaceutical industry.

## HEIGHTENED REGULATORY OVERSIGHT

Across the globe there has been an increase in the involvement of governments and their regulatory agencies in a number of areas that

are impacting the pharmaceutical industry. These include:

- Marketing codes: All pharmaceutical companies attempt to update doctors on the latest information about the latest trends, innovations and benefi cial eff ects of newer formulations and injectable products. Dr. Reddy's, for instance, follows a strict marketing code in dealing with medical practitioners across all geographies that usually exceeds the standards laid down by the national regulators. However, in recent times, governments are putting in place even tighter standards in this area . While we welcome the change in standards as these are intended to safeguard patients' interests, it needs to be recognized that such interventions impose higher cost of sales.
- Quality standards: There has been a sharp increase in the frequency of site inspections by international regulatory agencies. Quite often, these are surprise inspections. Any signifi cant slip in standards usually results in an immediate ban on the production unit. It needs emphasizing that Dr. Reddy's follows strict quality, safety and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards across all its production facilities, which incorporate regular internal programs on quality and safety awareness and production discipline along with the advice of specialized quality consultants.
- Barriers to competition: In certain developed and pharmerging nations, there has been a rise in the use of tariff and non-tariff barriers to support domestic manufacturers against foreign competition. These involve raising import duties, prohibiting certain imports and creating price diff erentiation and other interventions to promote locally manufactured products. For example, in 2009, Russia initiated its 'Pharma 2020' program with the goal to increase the share of locally produced medicines up to 50%. To achieve this, the program has laid out objectives such as developing the local production and

technological capabilities, fostering R&D for innovative medicines, protecting the internal market against what it considers unfair competition and others. Such interventions are expected to intensify in some developed and pharmerging markets and, therefore, may aff ect global pharmaceutical companies that export to several regions.

## RISING COSTS

Developing new medicines is becoming an increasingly expensive business, although how expensive, is the subject of fi erce debate. The combination of incremental innovation by key generics players and rising annual average costs per approved new molecule pose a major challenge in the long run, especially for the global pharmaceutical majors in a milieu where most of them are facing imminent falls off the patent cliff .

## DR. REDDY'S MARKET PERFORMANCE, FY2014 VERSUS FY2013

Refer Table 2 for a snapshot of our geographywise performance for FY2014.

## NORTH AMERICA (NA) GENERICS

The US is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world. Generic penetration in the US has jumped from approximately 70% of prescriptions to around 85% over the last 5 years and is expected to increase further, aided by patent expiries and with health providers and insurers attempting to cut their pharmaceutical costs. The market share in terms of total prescriptions of generics manufactured by Indian companies has increased from around 12% in 2008 to the region of 26% in 2013.

As mentioned in the earlier section, there has been a clear trend towards (a) consolidation among pharmaceutical wholesalers/ distributors and pharmacy chains and (b) increasing competition in the generics space. Taken together, these two factors have created pressure on price realization among the existing generic manufacturers.

In such a scenario, Dr. Reddy's North America Generics (NAG) operations' revenues increased by 46% to ' 55,303 million in FY2014.

This growth was largely contributed by new product launches, as well as improved market share in key existing molecules such as metoprolol succinate and atorvastatin.

Overall, the focus has been on launching diffi cult to make products which are likely to provide a sustainable stream of cash fl ows over the coming years. In this direction, we reached two key milestones in FY2014:

- a) Laying the foundation for our growing complex injectable portfolio. Our top fi ve injectable products contributed to more than US$ 200 million for the year.
- b) The non-injectable space also saw some good launches, especially divalproex extended release and donepezil 23 mg.

Dr. Reddy's OTC portfolio continues to be a signifi cant component of the overall performance. We are currently ranked 2 nd in the store brand OTC space. This segment is poised for rapid growth in the coming years with increasing coverage and prescription to OTC switches.

Strong capabilities, effi cient processes and systems, established sales and distribution networks and better execution have fuelled this year's growth. Continued focus on developing niche limited competition products and investing prudently to build capabilities in key areas should continue to aid growth in the foreseeable future.

## EMERGING MARKETS: RUSSIA, CIS AND THE REST OF THE WORLD (ROW)

RUSSIA

According to the IMS, the Russian pharmaceutical market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% between 2012 and 2017, driven by personal income growth and governmental reforms to increase access to healthcare. In FY2014, however, the nation faced several challenges, three of which are given below.

- The Ukraine crisis: There has been an economic slowdown at the start of 2014 as the Ukraine crisis forced investors to pull money out of the country. In the fi rst three months of 2014, the Rouble lost 9% against the US Dollar, making imports more expensive, while investors pulled out some US$ 70 billion out of the country, more than in all of 2013.
- Business environment: Investments rose by a modest 1.8% in 2013 compared to 9.1% in 2012, largely due to an unpredictable business environment.

- Physician-medical representative interaction: Tougher regulations on interaction between pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals will require new access strategies. These involve key account management approaches and, more gradually, greater use of digital communication. Face-to-face detailing will, however, still be critical to the promotion of new drugs.

Taking these factors into consideration, volumes in the Russian pharmaceutical space declined by 5.0% in FY2014 (IMS). Relatively speaking, therefore, Dr. Reddy's did well with a volume growth of 4.1%. In value terms, our revenues in Russia grew by 16% to ' 16.3 billion. This growth has been driven by:

- a) increased market coverage;
- b) enhanced fi eld force eff ort on the major brands in the prescription segment; and
- c) increased focus on the OTC portfolio.

OTC continues to lead the growth at 22% - driven by top brands such as Cetrine and Nise Gel. As per IMS Health, we are the 3 rd fastest growing company among the top 25 in the OTC space and have gained fi ve ranks compared to FY2013. In the prescription segment, we are ranked 13 th , with a growth faster than the market both in terms of value and volume.

## OTHER CIS COUNTRIES

Dr. Reddy's CIS presence is in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Belarus. Revenues from other CIS countries grew by 22% to ' 3.5 billion in FY2014. Growth in CIS as a whole is largely on account of increasing business in the Ukraine market which remains unaff ected despite serious political issues. The focus area for these markets is on improving the portfolio with diff erentiated prescription and OTC products through both in-house manufacturing and in-licensing deals.

REST OF THE WORLD (ROW) RoW for Dr. Reddy's includes markets like Venezuela and South Africa which have

experienced high growth rates in the past few years - in addition to Australia, New Zealand and markets in Southeast Asia.

Venezuela has been one of the fastest growing RoW geographies for Dr. Reddy's with a growth of 53% compared to the previous year. This has taken place notwithstanding numerous challenges such as: (a) sharp currency devaluation, (b) continued protests against the incumbent government, (c) massive infl ation running at over 60% per annum and (d) an unsettled and agitated population due to periodic non-availability of essential goods. Our increased market share has been on account of eff ective sales and marketing eff orts backed by timely supplies.

South Africa reported a moderate growth of 6% in the current year on account of economic challenges leading to market slowdown and limited GDP growth. However, we retained the 9th rank in the overall generics market.

Dr. Reddy's will continue to grow in these markets on the back of a diff erentiated portfolio introductions and a conscious movement towards the OTC segment over the coming years.

## INDIA

India's pharmaceutical market is expected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 16%, driven primarily by favorable demographics including country's aging population, changing disease profi les, growing affl uence and disposable income and increasing provider penetration.

Despite the hit due to price caps on the National List of Essential Medicines, 2013 (NLEM 2013) for some of our larger brands, the growth momentum of Dr. Reddy's in domestic formulations in FY2014 continued to beat the overall market, as it had in FY2013. According to the IMS report for the trailing 12-month period ended 31 March 2014, the Company's MAT (Moving Annual Total) sales growth stood at 12.2% against a market growth of 9.9%.

Dr. Reddy's India business saw strong performance of the top brands within the portfolio, which contributed close to 50% of sales. More than two-thirds of the top brands beat their respective market growths as refl ected in the IMS data. Even brands aff ected by NLEM 2013 displayed sizable volume growth due to strong price elasticities and specifi c actions to drive market expansion by leveraging lower NLEM 2013-driven prices.

The domestic formulations business launched 11 new products in the market with enhanced emphasis on fi rst-to-market and diff erentiated products. Signifi cant product innovations were introduced such as Optidoz Â® , which is a unique low dose combination of three anti-hypertensive drugs and Metsmall Â® , which is a smaller size, easier-to-swallow Metformin tablet to treat Type II diabetes.

In the course of FY2014, we increased our fi eld force coverage in many high-growth, superspecialty areas such as oncology, nephrology, urology, hepatology and rheumatology to drive growth for our diff erentiated products and biosimilars. Additionally, two new sales teams were launched to tap the growth potential from the government institutions and corporate hospitals segments. Multiple technology-based, patient-care services were also piloted for super-specialty drugs and chronic conditions to drive better patient outcomes through therapy adherence and patient counseling.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

FY2014 was a challenging year for the PSAI business with revenues declining by 22% compared to FY2013. Decreased sales of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients was primarily due to some of our key customers losing market shares during the year, coupled with lower sales from 'launch molecules' vis-Ã -vis the previous year. The pharmaceutical services business also saw a slowdown in the demand for custom services from some of our innovator company customers. However, being vertically integrated, the API business continues to support our Global Generic launches.

Asia Pacifi c is fast becoming a dominant player in the global API business, both in terms of supply and demand. Countries such as India and China have become global hubs for API outsourcing, primarily due to their low cost of production and strong domestic demand. However, the industry is also facing some challenges, with newer market entrants increasing competition and eroding API prices. Mergers, collaborations, high levels of cost competency and optimal inventory management are strategies that have been noticed across the API industry in order to survive and grow.

Dr. Reddy's is one of the highest Drug Master File (DMF) fi lers worldwide. During FY2014, we fi led 61 DMFs globally, including 12 in the US, 13 in Europe and 36 in other markets. The cumulative number of DMF fi lings as on 31 March 2014 was 631.

## REVENUES

Revenues increased by 14% to ' 132,170 million in FY2014. Revenue growth was largely driven by our Global Generics segment's operations in the US and 'Emerging Markets' (which comprises Russia, other countries of the former Soviet Union and certain other countries from our Rest of the World markets).

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profi t rose by 25% to ' 75,801 million in FY2014. This translates to a gross profi t margin of 57.4% in FY2014 versus 52.1% in FY2013. The gross profi t margin for Global Generics was 65.8%; and for the PSAI business, it was 20.2%. After accounting for the favorable currency eff ect in FY2014, the factors that positively aff ected gross profi t margins for the Global Generics segment were:

- higher contribution from new product launches with better margins; and

## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The management duly considers and takes appropriate action on recommendations made by the statutory auditors, internal auditors and the independent Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Details on internal controls is given in the chapter on Corporate Governance .

## ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

Dr. Reddy's follows the COSO-ERM framework. The ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- Proactively identify and highlight risks to the right stakeholders
- Facilitate discussions around risk prioritization and mitigation
- Provide a framework to assess risk capacity and appetite; and develop systems to warn when the appetite is getting breached
- Provide an analysis of residual risk

The ERM team connects with business units and functions who are the primary source for risk identifi cation. It also regularly monitors external trends on liabilities and litigations as well as risks reported by peers.

## RISK IDENTIFICATION AND MITIGATION AT THE BUSINESS UNIT OR FUNCTION LEVEL

The ERM team conducts interviews, on-call discussions and facilitates polls to enable prioritization at the unit/function level. While the Company also has a functionally independent assurance process for compliance and fi nancial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the team focuses on identifi cation of business, operational and strategic risks.

Mitigation plans for the key business risks are identifi ed, along with timelines and owners. The ERM team periodically examines the mitigation process through discussions or reviews and these observations are discussed with the Company's Management. Detailed polls and interviews are carried out once every two

years; and risk registers are updated with the new and/or emerging risks.

## RISK AGGREGATION, PRIORITIZATION AND MITIGATION AT THE ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL

Risks are aggregated at the unit/function and organization level by risk groups. There are some 60 such groups across the categories of (i) strategic, (ii) operational, (iii) fi nancial and (iv) compliance. A management-level Risk Committee comprising of business segment heads, fi nance, legal, HR, safety, pharmacovigilance and quality is entrusted to rank and prioritize organization-wide risks, review these and steer mitigation eff orts in line with the Company's risk capacity and appetite.

Progress on risk mitigation, risk transfer and insurance initiatives are reviewed by the Finance Investment and Risk Management Council (FIRM Council) which is also responsible for fi nancial investments and capital allocation decisions.

## REVIEWING THE STATUS OF MITIGATION AND RESIDUAL RISKS

The ERM function's responsibility is to provide a periodic review of (i) risks identifi ed and prioritized across the Company, (ii) any breaches and how these have been dealt with, (iii) the status of mitigation and (iv) residual risks.

The Head of Dr. Reddy's ERM team provides periodic updates to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. These include:

- a) Quarterly - on the status of key derisking initiatives and new initiatives or projects taken up by the ERM team
- b) Annually - on key risks and their movement compared to previous years including the residual risks

During FY2014, the ERM team supported a pilot roll-out on business continuity planning across three Indian units of the Company. The exercise helped in understanding and planning for crisis. Learnings from this pilot shall be used for subsequent roll-out across

the rest of the organization. The ERM team also automated and expanded the Key Risk Indicator tracking process as well as its metrics to enable a uniform global roll-out across the Company and thus integrate risk management as a part of Dr. Reddy's quantifi able and measurable strategy.

## PEOPLE: HUMAN RESOURCES (HR) AT DR. REDDY'S

We strive to understand the ethos and cater to the requirements of our diverse yet unifi ed workforce. We currently stand at more than 19,000 employees worldwide of which around 2,800 are located outside India. We emphasize sound people practices that equip our people to succeed.

We were recognized as the Best Place to Work among biotech and pharmaceutical companies in India in the Great Places to Work ranking for 2013. In addition, Dr. Reddy's was ranked 5 th among companies having over 10,000 employees.

In FY2014, we launched our global recognition platform, 'Well Done'. The program enables managers and colleagues to recognize and reward good work and foster a culture of appreciation.

Our focus continues to be on leadership development and talent management. With the objective of continually building leaders, we have customized and rolled out a leadership development program at Hyderabad, with the unique feature of individual breakthrough projects that participants complete during the course.

Our Annual Leadership Summit conducted in FY2014 was on 'Delivering Industry Leading Growth'. Top leaders attended this program to put together our strategy for the coming year. A drive to simplify processes this year focused on employee touch-points, interactions with partners and all other processes with the aim of increasing ease and productivity. Our productivity has also improved by using overall equipment

eff ectiveness metrics including HR inputs such as measuring and optimizing manpower availability and staffi ng.

## OUTLOOK

The Company believes that its focus on profi table growth and targeting a leadership position in GG and PSAI will create signifi cant value in the near term.

In GG, improving depth through portfolio expansion, cost leadership, consistent delivery of limited competition products and supply chain excellence should lead to a leadership position in key markets. In PSAI, the objective is to be the partner of choice by creating compelling value for customers through leveraging IP, technology and cost leadership. In Proprietary Products, the aim is to create a viable business by calibrating investments to produce a self sustainable model.

The Company has a positive outlook for the next year. The largest increment of growth is expected to be contributed by the North America Generics and the Emerging Markets businesses.

In a dynamic business environment, the Company's base business model in pharmaceuticals is exposed to considerable volatility, both upwards and downwards. While the upsides create non-linear value for the organization, there is a conscious attempt to protect it against the downsides.

## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

## BUSINESS RESPONSIBILITY REPORT

A detailed Business Responsibility Report is given as a separate chapter in the annual report.

## SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

The Company has 51 subsidiaries as on 31 March 2014. During FY2014, two subsidiaries namely, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Canada Inc., USA and Dr. Reddy's Singapore PTE. Ltd., Singapore were incorporated. Further, during FY2014, Reddy US Therapeutics Inc., USA ceased to be a subsidiary of the Company.

As per Section 212 of the Companies Act, 1956, the Company is required to attach the Directors' Report, Balance Sheet and Statement of Profi t and Loss of the subsidiaries to the annual report. The Ministry of Corporate Aff airs, Government of India vide its circular No. 2/2011 dated 8 February 2011 has provided an exemption to the companies from complying with Section 212, provided such companies publish the audited consolidated fi nancial statements in their annual report.

Accordingly, the annual report 2013-14 does not contain the fi nancial statements of the subsidiaries. The audited annual accounts and related information of the subsidiaries,

where applicable, will be made available for inspection during business hours at our registered offi ce in Hyderabad, India. The same will also be published on the Company's website: www.drreddys.com

The members, if they so desire, may write to the Company Secretary at Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, 8-2-337, Road No. 3, Banjara Hills, Hyderabad 500 034, to obtain a copy of the fi nancials of the subsidiary companies.

The consolidated fi nancial statements, in terms of Section 129 of the Companies Act, 2013 and Clause 32 of the Listing Agreement and prepared in accordance with Accounting Standard 21 as specifi ed in the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 also forms a part of this annual report.

## DIRECTORS

Sub-section (10) of Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013 (eff ective 1 April 2014) provides that an Independent Director shall hold offi ce for a term of up to fi ve consecutive years on the Board of a Company; and shall be eligible for re-appointment on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders of the Company. Sub-section (11) of the same section states that no Independent Director shall be eligible for more than two consecutive terms of up to fi ve years each. In addition, sub-section 13 of Section 149 states that the provisions of retirement by rotation as defi ned in sub-sections (6) and (7) of Section 152 of the Act, shall not apply to such Independent Directors.

The new Clause 49 notifi ed by the SEBI on April 17, 2014, most of which comes into eff ect from 1 October 2014, states in sub-clause II (B)(2) that any Independent Director "who has already served fi ve years or more in a listed company as on 1 October 2014, shall be eligible for appointment, on completion of his present term, for one more term of up to fi ve years only."

The appointment of Non-Executive Directors - whose sub-set comprise Independent Directors - under the Companies Act, 1956 was a de facto term of three years because one third of such fi duciaries were eligible for retirement by rotation. Therefore, it stands to reason that those Independent Directors who would complete their present three-year term at the ensuing AGM of the Company in July 2014, and are eligible for re-appointment, may be considered by the shareholders for re-appointment for a term of up to fi ve years.

Therefore, the Board recommends to reappoint the retiring Directors, Mr. Anupam Puri for an additional period of four years and Dr. Bruce L A Carter and Mr. Sridar Iyengar, for an additional period of fi ve years each, respectively.

Further, the Board also recommends the appointment of Dr. Ashok S Ganguly, Dr. J P Moreau, Ms. Kalpana Morparia, Dr. Omkar Goswami and Mr. Ravi Bhoothalingam as Independent Directors under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement, not liable to retire by rotation and to hold offi ce for the period as stated in their respective resolutions and the explanatory statement forming part of the Notice of the AGM.

The brief profi le of all the Independent Directors is given in the Corporate Governance section of the annual report for reference of the shareholders.

The Board of Directors at their meeting held on 13 May 2014 has re-designated Mr. Satish Reddy as Chairman and Mr. G V Prasad as Co-Chairman, Managing Director and Chief Executive Offi cer of the Company.

Further, pursuant to the provisions of Section 152 of the Companies Act, 2013 (eff ective 1 April 2014), one-third of the retiring Board members (other than Independent Directors), shall retire every year and if eligible, can be re-appointed, by the shareholders at their meeting.

Hence, approval of shareholders is also being sought for variation in terms of appointment of Mr. G V Prasad and Mr. Satish Reddy, Executive Directors for making their offi ce liable to retire by rotation. All other terms and conditions of their appointment shall remain unchanged.

The respective resolutions to the abovereferred matters are included in the notice convening the 30th Annual General Meeting scheduled on 31 July 2014.

## DIRECTORS' RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT

## STATUTORY AUDITORS

The statutory auditors of the Company, B S R & Co. LLP, Chartered Accountants, retire at the ensuing Annual General Meeting and have confi rmed their eligibility and willingness to accept offi ce of the statutory auditors, if re-appointed.

## DIRECTORS' REPORT

Section 139(2) of the Companies Act, 2013 (eff ective 1 April 2014), mandates that a listed company or such other prescribed classes of companies shall not appoint or reappoint an audit fi rm as Statutory Auditors for more than two terms of fi ve consecutive years each.

Further, the companies as aforesaid, whose Statutory Auditors has held offi ce for a period of ten years or more are required to comply with these provisions, within three years from the date of commencement of these provisions i.e. 1 April 2014.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

$^{1}$ Specifi c areas in which R&D activities were carried out by the Company are:

Our research and development activities can be classifi ed into several categories, which run parallel to the activities in our principal areas of operations:

- Global Generics, where our research and development activities are directed at the development of product formulations, process validation, bioequivalence testing and other data needed to develop the drugs that are equivalent to brand name products for sale in the emerging markets or whose patents and regulatory exclusivity periods have expired or are nearing expiration in the highly regulated markets of the United States and Europe. Global Generics also include our biologics business, where research and development activities are directed at the development of biologics products for the emerging as well as highly regulated markets.

Our new biologics research and development facility caters to the highest development standards, including cGMP, Good Laboratory Practices and bio-safety level IIA.

- Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients, where our research and development activities concentrate on development of chemical processes for the synthesis of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and intermediates (API) for use in our Global Generics segment and for sales in the emerging and developed markets to third parties. Our research and development activities also support our custom pharmaceutical services business and enable us to leverage the strength of our process chemistry and fi nished dosage development expertise to target innovator as well as emerging pharmaceutical companies. The research and development is directed towards providing services to support the entire pharmaceutical value chain - from discovery all the way to the market.
- Proprietary Products, where we are actively developing drugs based on Diff erentiated Formulations and discovery and development of new molecules, sometimes also referred to as 'New Chemical Entity' or 'NCEs'. Our research and development programs focus on the following therapeutic areas:
- Neurology
- Dermatology
- Pain and Anti-infectives

We are focusing on an integrated research and development strategy to build sustainable mix of proprietary and branded Research and development portfolio of products in the above chosen Therapeutic areas.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## To the members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ('the Company') which comprises the balance sheet as at 31 March 2014, the statement of profit and loss and the cash flow statement for the year then ended and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

## Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Accounting Standards referred to in sub-section (3C) of Section 211 of the Companies Act, 1956 ("the Act"). This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall pr esentation of the fi nancial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

## Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the financial statements give the information required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India:

- (i) in the case of the balance sheet, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2014;
- (ii) in the case of the statement of profit and loss, of the profit for the year ended on that date; and
- (iii) in the case of the cash flow statement, of the cash flows for the year ended on that date.

## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements

- 2. As required by Section 227(3) of the Act, we report that:
- (a) we have obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purpose of our audit;
- (b) in our opinion proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as appears from our examination of those books;

- (d) in our opinion, the balance sheet, the statement of profit and loss and the cash flow statement comply with the Accounting Standards referred to in sub-section (3C) of Section 211 of the Companies Act, 1956, to the extent applicable; and
- (e) on the basis of written representations received from the directors as on 31 March 2014, and taken on record by the Board of Directors, none of the directors is disqualified as on 31 March 2014, from being appointed as a director in terms of clause (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 274 of the Companies Act, 1956.

The Annexure referred to in the auditors' report to the members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company") for the year ended 31 March 2014.

## We report that:

- i. (a) The Company has maintained proper records showing full particulars, including quantitative details and situation of fixed assets.
- (b) The Company has a regular programme of physical verification of its fixed assets by which all fixed assets are verified in a phased manner over a period of 3 years. In our opinion, this periodicity of physical verification is reasonable having regard to the size of the Company and the nature of its assets. No material discrepancies were noticed on such verification.
- (c) Fixed assets disposed off during the year were not substantial and therefore do not affect the going concern assumption.
- ii. (a) Inventories, except goods-in-transit and stocks lying with third parties have been physically verified by the management during the year.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## a) Basis of preparation

The financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("DRL" or "the Company") have been prepared and presented in accordance with Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (IGAAP) under historical cost convention on an accrual basis. Pursuant to circular 15/2013 dated 13 September 2013 read with circular 08/2014 dated 4 April 2014 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the existing accounting standards notified under the Companies Act, 1956 shall apply till the standards of accounting or any addendum thereto are prescribed by the Central Government in consultation and recommendation of the National Financial Reporting Authority. Consequently, these financial statements have been prepared to comply in all material aspects with accounting standards notified by the Central Government of India under Section 211 (3C) of the Companies Act, 1956, other pronouncements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Collectively referred to as "IGAAP"). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupees rounded off to the nearest million.

## b) Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IGAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the year. Examples of such estimates include estimation of useful life of tangible and intangible assets, assessment of recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets, provision for obligations relating to employees, provisions against litigations and impairment of assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

## c) Current and non current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Revised Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956.

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current assets / liabilities include the current portion of non current financial assets / liabilities respectively. All other assets / liabilities are classified as non current.

## d) Tangible fi xed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation. The cost of fixed assets includes non refundable taxes, duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the respective assets.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible fixed asset is capitalised only if it increases the future benefits from the existing assets beyond its previously assessed standards of performance.

Advances paid towards acquisition of tangible fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are shown under long term loans and advances. Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on the balance sheet date, is shown as capital work-in-progress.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method at the rates specified in Schedule XIV to the Companies Act, 1956 or based on the useful life of the assets as estimated by the Company's management, whichever is higher. Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of installation till the $\_{date the assets are sold or disposed. Individual assets costing less than }$'$\_{ 5,000/- are depreciated in full in the year of acquisition. Assets acquired on finance leases are }$ depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life whichever is shorter. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their estimated useful life, or the remaining period of lease, whichever is shorter.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of fixed assets are given below:

|                                           | Years    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                 |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings    | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                    | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and machinery                       | 3 to 15  |
| Electrical equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Laboratory equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and offi ce equipment | 4 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                  | 4 to 5   |

Gains or losses from disposal of tangible fixed assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## e) Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of those fixed assets which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by the Company in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.

## f) Intangible assets and amortisation

Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition including any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing authorities), and any directly attributable expenditure in making the asset ready for its intended use.

Intangible assets are amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for its use.

The Company's management estimates the useful lives for the various intangible assets as follows:

|                                                                    | Years     |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Customer contracts                                                 | 2 to 5    |
| Technical know-how                                                 | 10        |
| Non-Compete fee                                                    | 1.5 to 10 |
| Product related intangibles                                        | 5 to 10   |
| Copyrights and Patents (including marketing / distribution rights) | 3 to 10   |

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal. Gains or losses arising from the disposal of intangible assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## g) Investments

Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be held for not more than 12 months from the date, on which such investments are made, are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as non current investments.

Current investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value. The comparison of cost and fair value is done separately in respect of each category of investment.

Non current investments are carried at cost less any other-than-temporary diminution in value, determined separately for each individual investment. The reduction in the carrying amount is reversed when there is a rise in the value of the investment or if the reasons for the reduction no longer exist. Any reduction in the carrying amount and any reversal in such reductions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss.

## h) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value (NRV) is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. The cost of all categories of inventory is determined using weighted average cost method.

## i) Research and development

Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss when incurred.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if the enterprise can demonstrate all of the following:

- a) the product or the process is technically and commercially feasible;
- b) future economic benefits are probable and ascertainable;
- c) the Company intends to and has suffi cient resources to complete development of the product and has the ability to use or sell the asset; and
- d) development costs can be measured reliably.

## j) Employee benefi ts

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The long term obligations are measured at present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates refl ecting the yields on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations. Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

All actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to profit or loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Compensated leave of absence

The Company provides for accumulation of compensated absences by certain categories of its employees. These employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof as per Company policy. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The measurement of such obligation is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualified actuary.

## Employee stock option schemes

In accordance with the SEBI guidelines, the cost is calculated based on intrinsic value method i.e., the excess of the market price of shares, at the date prior to the day of grant of options under the Employee stock option schemes, over the exercise price is treated as employee compensation and amortised over the vesting period.

## k) Foreign currency transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the respective transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date are reported using the foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. The resultant exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non monetary assets and liabilities are carried at the rates prevailing on the date of transaction.

Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of the Company's net investment in a non integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve in the Company's financial statements. Such exchange differences are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the event of disposal of the net investment.

## l) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The premium or discount on foreign exchange forward contracts is amortized as income or expense over the life of the contract. The exchange difference is calculated and recorded in accordance with AS-11 (revised) in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts and swap contracts are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as they arise. Fair value of such option and swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques considering the terms of the contract.

Pursuant to ICAI Announcement "Accounting for Derivatives" on the early adoption of Accounting Standard AS-30 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement", the Company has adopted the Standard, to the extent that the adoption does not conflict with existing mandatory accounting standards and other authoritative pronouncements, Company law and other regulatory requirements.

## Cashfl ow hedges

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified into the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/ loss on such non derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, gets expired or is sold, terminated or exercised before the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, the hedge accounting on such transaction is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in hedging reserve continues to remain there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the balance in hedging reserve is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## m) Revenue recognition

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is reasonably certain, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances.

Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

## Sales returns

The Company accounts for sales returns by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates.

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognized in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognized as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profit share is available.

## Service Income

Service income is recognised as per the terms of contracts with customers when the related services are performed, or the agreed milestones are achieved.

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Dividend and interest income

Dividend income is recognised when the unconditional right to receive the income is established. Income from interest on deposits, loans and interest bearing securities is recognised on a time proportion basis.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## Export incentives

Export entitlements are recognised as reduction from cost of material consumed when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## n) Income tax expense

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.

## Current tax

The current charge for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the relevant tax regulations applicable to the Company.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax charge or credit refl ects the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period. The deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future; however, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is a virtual certainty of realisation of such assets.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are written-down or written-up to refl ect the amount that is reasonably/virtually certain (as the case may be) to be realised.

## o) Earnings per share

The basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the profit after tax for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, profit after tax for the year and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. The diluted potential equity shares have been adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e., the average market value of the outstanding shares).

## p) Provisions and contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the fi nancial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an infl ow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## q) Impairment of assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (Cash Generating Unit or CGU) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its net selling price. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.

If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is refl ected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of amortised historical cost.

## r) Leases

The lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, at the inception of the lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an asset. A finance lease is recognized as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalized and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

## s) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment.

- (b) Consequent to the increase in expected cash flows of some of the products forming part of product related intangibles pertaining to Company's Global Generics segment, the Company assessed the recoverability of money advanced to one of its subsidiaries which had funded the acquisition of such product related $\_{intangibles and reversed }$'$\_{ 280 of provision for doubtful advances during the year.}$
- (c) $\_{In the previous year, the Company had advanced a sum of }$'$\_{ 245 towards investment in Reddy Pharma Iberia SA. As the shares were not alloted by the end of }$ previous year, the said amount was classified as "Advance towards Investment". Further, the advance was provided for as not recoverable and recorded as other expenditure. In the current period, shares were issued to the Company and accordingly the earlier provision for advance is reclassified as provision for permanent diminution in the value of investments with an equivalent reversal in "other expenses".

## (d) DPCO matters

The Company has received demands for payment to the credit of the Drug Prices Equalisation Account under Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1995 for few of its products which are being contested. Based on its best estimate, the Company has made a provision for the potential liability related to the overcharged amount including the interest thereon and believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of penalty on this demand is not probable. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in its litigation in the Supreme Court, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and including penalties, if any, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (e) Fuel surcharge adjustment

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") has passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Company filed separate Writs of Mandamus before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh (the "High Court") challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC for various periods.

$\_{The Company, after taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, has recorded an amount of }$'$\_{ 215 as the potential liability towards FSA }$ charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period $\_{from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is approximately }$'$\_{ 473. As of 31 March 2014, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of }$ '$\_{ 267 demanded by the }$ power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional financial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

## (f) Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl $\_{uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fixed at }$'$\_{ 0.0013 per acre for dry land and }$ '$\_{ 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of }$'$\_{ 3. The Company believes that the possibility of additional liability }$ is remote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT.

## (g) Water pollution and air pollution

During the three months ended 31 December 2011, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board ("APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specified by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee (similar to a letter of credit) to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board ("the APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index issued a notification that reimposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

- (h) Assessable value of products supplied by a vendor to the Company

During the year ended 31 March 2003, the Central Excise Authorities of India ("the Central Excise Authorities") issued a demand notice to a vendor of the Company regarding the assessable value of products supplied by this vendor to the Company. The Company has been named as a co-defendant in this demand notice. $\_{The Central Excise Authorities demanded payment of }$' $\_{176 from the vendor, including penalties of }$ '$\_{ 90. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities }$ $\_{issued a penalty claim of }$'$\_{ 70 against the Company. During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor }$ $\_{demanding }$'$\_{ 226 from the vendor, including a penalty of }$ '$\_{ 51. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of }$'$\_{ 7 against the }$ $\_{Company. Furthermore, during the year ended 31 March 2006, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding }$'$\_{ 34. The }$ Company filed appeals against these notices with the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the "CESTAT"). In October 2006, the CESTAT passed an order in favour of the Company setting aside all of the above demand notices. In July 2007, the Central Excise Authorities appealed against CESTAT's order in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi.

## (i) Distribution of input service tax credits

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various show cause notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each of such show cause notices and the consequential actions on and status of the same.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED                                    | STATUS AS ON 31 MARCH 2014                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

The CESTAT also ordered  $\_{the Company to make an interim deposit of }$'$\_{ 50. The Company made the }$ requisite deposit and is awaiting a hearing with the Central Excise Commissioner. |

| April 2011 to March 2012          | '$\_{ 51 plus interest and }$ penalties             | The Company has responded to such show cause notice and is currently awaiting  a hearing with the Central Excise Commissioner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| April 2012 to March 2013          | '$\_{ 54 plus interest and }$ penalties             | The Company is in the process of responding to such notice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The Company believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of the alleged inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable.

## (j) Direct tax matter

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Indian Income Tax authorities disallowed for tax purposes certain business transactions entered into by the parent company $\_{with its wholly owned subsidiaries. The associated tax impact is }$'$\_{ 658. The Company believes that such business transactions are allowed for tax deduction under }$ Indian Income Tax laws and has accordingly filed an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Hyderabad. The Company further believes that the probability of succeeding in this matter is more likely than not and therefore no provision was made in the financial statements.

- (k) Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse effect on its financial statements.

## EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan-2002 ("the DRL 2002 Plan"): The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Under the Scheme, the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board ('the Committee') shall administer the Scheme and grant stock options to eligible directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Committee shall determine the employees eligible for receiving the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for the options issued on the date of the grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan options vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

## 2.30: EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME (CONTINUED)

The DRL 2002 Plan was amended on 28 July 2004 at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to provide for stock options grants in two categories:

Category A: 1,721,700 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 573,778 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares $\_{(i.e., }$'$\_{ 5 per option). }$

The DRL 2002 Plan was further amended on 27 July 2005 at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to provide for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares $\_{(i.e., }$'$\_{ 5 per option).}$

The fair market value of a share on each grant date falling under Category A above is defined as the average closing price (after adjustment of Bonus issue) for 30 days prior to the grant, in the stock exchange where there was highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after getting the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the issue of bonus shares by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock options granted in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|

| Balance of shares that can be allotted on exercise of options (B) | 205,939                               | 1,847,685                             | 2,053,624 |
| Options arising from stock dividend (C)                           | 205,939                               | 1,847,685                             | 2,053,624 |
| Options reserved after stock dividend (A+B+C)                     | 505,939                               | 3,843,163                             | 4,349,102 |

In the case of termination of employment, all unvested options would stand cancelled. Options that have vested but have not been exercised can be exercised within the time prescribed under each option agreement by the Committee or if no time limit is prescribed, within three months of the date of employment termination, failing which they would stand cancelled.

The term of the DRL 2002 Plan expired on 29 January 2012. Consequently, the Board of Directors of the Company, based on the recommendation of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, resolved to extend the term of the DRL 2002 Plan for a period of 10 years with effect from 29 January 2012, subject to the approval of shareholders. A resolution to this effect was approved by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

During the current year, the Company under the DRL 2002 Plan has issued 258,870 Catagory B options to eligible employees. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

The date of grant, number of options granted, exercise price fixed by the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee for respective options and the market price of the shares of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant are given below:

| DATE OF GRANT   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS GRANTED   |   $\_{EXERCISE PRICE }$' | $\_{MARKET PRICE }$' (AS PER SEBI GUIDELINES)   |

Dr. Reddy's Employees ADR Stock Option Plan-2007 ("the DRL 2007 Plan"): The Company instituted the DRL 2007 Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2005. The DRL 2007 Plan came into effect on approval of the Board of Directors on 22 January 2007. The DRL 2007 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Under the DRL 2007 Plan, the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board ('the Committee') shall administer the DRL 2007 Plan and grant stock options to eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee shall determine the employees eligible for receiving the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of the grant.

## 2.35: HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Russian roubles and Euros, and foreign currency debt in U.S. dollars, Russian roubles and Euros.

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, the Company also uses non derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

$\_{The Company had a net asset of }$'$\_{ 431 as of 31 March 2014 as compared to a net asset of }$ '$\_{ 436 as of 31 March 2013 towards these derivative financial instruments.}$

## 2.35: HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

$\_{In respect of the aforesaid hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions, the Company has recorded, in reserves and surplus, a net loss of }$'$\_{ 407 and a net profit of }$ '$\_{ 405 }$ $\_{for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company also recorded, as part of revenue, a net loss of }$'$\_{ 946 and }$ '$\_{ 352 during the year ended 31 March }$ 2014 and 2013, respectively.

$\_{The net carrying amount of the Company's "hedging reserve" was a loss of }$'$\_{ 5 as at 31 March 2014, as compared to a gain of }$ '$\_{ 402 as at 31 March 2013.}$

The table below summarises the periods when the forecasted cash flows associated with derivative hedging instruments that are classified as cash flow hedges, are expected to occur:

Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items are recognised as part of foreign exchange gains and losses.

Fair values of foreign exchange derivative contracts are determined under the Modified Black Scholes technique by using inputs from market observable data and other relevant terms of the contract with counter parties which are banks or financial institutions.

The following are the outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts for hedges of recognized assets and liabilities:

Derivative financial instruments valuation:

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions and banks. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value calculations.

## 2.36: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to refl ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee are responsible for overseeing Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.

## Trade receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. As at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 the maximum exposure $\_{to credit risk in relation to trade and other receivables is }$'$\_{ 45,615 and }$ '$\_{ 29,639 respectively (net of allowances).}$

Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired

$\_{Trade receivables amounting to }$'$\_{ 30,673 and }$ '$\_{ 23,557 were neither past due nor impaired as at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 respectively.}$

## b. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due.

## Financial guarantees

Financial guarantees disclosed in Note 2.24 have been provided as counter corporate guarantees to financial institutions and banks that have extended cr edits and other fi nancial assistance to the Company's subsidiaries. In this regard, the Company does not foresee any significant credit risk exposure.

## c. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk-sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Roubles and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in U.S. dollars, Euros and Roubles). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's financial performance gets adversely impacted. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has fluctuated substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted cash flows and trade receivables.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts are given in Note 2.35 above.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have $\_{resulted in an approximately }$'$\_{ 1,254/(945) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately }$ ' $\_{2,745/(2,892) increase/(decrease) in the Company's }$ net profit as at 31 March 2014.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would $\_{have resulted in an approximately }$'$\_{ 2,219/(1,751) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately }$ '$\_{ 1,642/(1,640) increase/(decrease) in the }$ Company's net profit as at 31 March 2013.

For the year ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies in the above $\_{mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by approximately }$'$\_{ 1,492 and }$ '$\_{ 822 respectively, from such financial assets/liabilities.}$

## Interest rate risk

$\_{As of 31 March 2014, the Company had foreign currency loans of }$'$\_{ 17,219 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 20-179 bps and }$ '$\_{ 846 carrying a floating interest }$ $\_{rate of Moscow Prime Offered Rate plus 60 bps whereas as of 31 March 2013 foreign currency loans were }$' $\_{8,104 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 100-150 }$ bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary. An increase or decrease of 10% in the floating interest rate component $\_{applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by approximately }$'$\_{ 10 and }$ '$\_{ 1 for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013, respectively. }$

The Company's investments in time deposits with banks and short term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. The Company has historically not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## To the Board of Directors of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("DRL" or the "parent company") and its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures (collectively referred to as "the Company" or "the Group"), which comprise the consolidated balance sheet as at 31 March 2014, the consolidated statement of profit and loss and the consolidated cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

## Management's responsibility for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view of the consolidated fi nancial position, consolidated fi nancial performance and consolidated cash flows of the Company in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. This responsibility includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the Company's preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

## Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India:

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## a) Basis of preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented in accordance with the Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("IGAAP") under historical cost convention on an accrual basis. Pursuant to circular 15/2013 dated 13 September 2013 rea d with circular 08/2014 dated 4 April 2014 issued by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, the existing accounting standards notified under the Companies Act, 1956 shall apply till the standards of accounting or any addendum thereto are prescribed by the Central Government in consultation and recommendation of the National Financial Reporting Authority. Consequently, these financial statements have been prepared to comply in all material aspects with accounting standards notified by the Central Government of India under Section 211 (3C) of the Companies Act, 1956, other pronouncements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Collectively referred to as "IGAAP"). The financial statements are presented in Indian rupees rounded off to the nearest million.

## b) Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IGAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the year. Examples of such estimates include estimation of useful life of tangible and intangible assets, assessment of recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets, provision for obligations relating to employees, provisions against litigations and impairment of assets. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

## c) Current and non-current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Revised Schedule VI to the Companies Act, 1956.

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current assets/ liabilities include the current portion of non-current financial assets/ liabilities respectively. All other assets/ liabilities are classified as non-current.

## d) Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("DRL" or the "parent company"), and all of its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "the Company" or "the Group"), in which the parent company has more than one-half of the voting power of an enterprise or where the parent company controls the composition of the board of directors. In accordance with AS 27 - "Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures", issued under Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006, the Company has accounted for its proportionate share of interest in joint venture by the proportionate consolidation method. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis:

- ï® The financial statements of the parent company and the subsidiaries have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after eliminating intra-group balances / transactions and resulting unrealised profits in full. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group transactions have also been eliminated except to the extent that recoverable value of related assets is lower than their cost to the Company. The amounts shown in respect of reserves comprise the amount of the relevant reserves as per the balance sheet of the parent company and its share in the post-acquisition increase in the relevant reserves of the subsidiaries.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

- ï® The proportionate share of Company's interest in Joint Ventures is combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after eliminating intra-group transactions and resulting unrealised profits, to the extent it pertains to the Company.
- ï® The excess / deficit of cost to the parent company of its investment in the subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates over its portion of equity at the respective dates on which investment in such entities were made is recognised in the financial statements as goodwill / capital reserve.
- ï® The consolidated financial statements are presented, to the extent possible, in the same format as that adopted by the parent company for its separate financial statements.
- ï® The consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances.

## e) Tangible fi xed assets and depreciation

Tangible fixed assets are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed assets includes non-refundable taxes, duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the respective assets.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible fixed asset is capitalised only if it increases the future benefits from the existing assets beyond its previously assessed standards of performance.

Advances paid towards acquisition of tangible fixed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are shown under long-term loans and advances. Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on the balance sheet date, is shown as capital work-in-progress.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method at the rates specified in Schedule XIV to the Companies Act, 1956 or based on the useful life of the assets as estimated by Management, whichever is higher. Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of installation till the date the assets are $\_{sold or disposed. Individual assets costing less than }$'$\_{ 5,000/- are depreciated in full in the year of acquisition. Assets acquired on finance leases are depreciated over the }$ period of the lease agreement or the useful life whichever is shorter. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over their estimated useful life, or the remaining period of lease, whichever is shorter.

## Land is not depreciated.

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of fixed assets are given below:

|                                           | Years    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                 |          |
| Factory and administrative buildings      | 20 to 50 |
| Ancillary structures                      | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and machinery                       | 3 to 15  |
| Electrical equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Laboratory equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to10   |
| Vehicles                                  | 4 to 5   |

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

Gains or losses from disposal of tangible fixed assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## f) Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of those fixed assets which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by the Company in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.

## g) Intangible assets and amortization

Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition including any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing authorities), and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use.

Intangible assets are amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for its use.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

The Company's management estimates the useful lives for various categories of intangible assets as follows:

|                                                                      | Years   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Goodwill                                                             | 5 to 20 |
| Customer related intangibles                                         | 2 to 11 |
| Patents, trademarks, etc. (including marketing/ distribution rights) | 3 to 16 |
| Technology related intangibles                                       | 3 to 13 |
| Product related intangibles                                          | 5 to 15 |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed at each financial year-end.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal. Gains or losses arising from the disposal of intangible asset are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## h) Investments

Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as non-current investments.

Non-current investments are carried at cost less any other-than-temporary diminution in value, determined separately for each individual investment. The reduction in the carrying amount is reversed when there is a rise in the value of the investment or if the reasons for the reduction no longer exist. Any reduction in the carrying amount and any reversal in such reductions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss.

Current investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value. The comparison of cost and fair value is done separately in respect of each category of investment.

## i) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value (NRV) is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale. Cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchase, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.

The cost of all categories of inventory is determined using weighted average cost method.

## j) Research and development

Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientifi c or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized in the statement of profi t and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if the enterprise can demonstrate all of the following:

- a. the product or the process is technically and commercially feasible;
- b. future economic benefits are probable and ascertainable;
- c. the Company intends to and has sufficient resources to complete development of the product and has the ability to use or sell the asset; and
- d. development costs can be measured reliably.

## k) Employee benefi ts

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The long term obligations are measured at present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations. Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

All actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## Defi ned contribution plan

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Compensated leave of absence

The Company provides for accumulation of compensated absences by certain categories of its employees. These employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof as per Company policy. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The measurement of such obligation is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualified actuary.

## Employee stock option schemes

In accordance with the SEBI guidelines, the cost is calculated based on intrinsic value method i.e. the excess of the market price of shares, at the date prior to the day of grant of options under the Employee stock option schemes, over the exercise price is treated as employee compensation and amortised over the vesting period.

## l) Foreign currency transactions, balances and translation of fi nancial statements of foreign operations

## Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the respective transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date are reported using the foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. The resultant exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried at the rates prevailing on the date of transaction.

Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of Company's net investment in a non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve in the Company's financial statements. Such exchange differences are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the event of disposal of the net investment.

## Foreign operations

The financial statements of the foreign integral subsidiaries, representative offices and branches collectively referred to as the 'foreign integral operations' are translated into Indian rupees as follows:

- ï® Items of income and expenditure are translated at the respective monthly average rates;
- ï® Monetary items are translated using the closing rate;
- ï® Non-monetary items are translated using the monthly average rate which is expected to approximate the actual rate on the date of transaction; and
- ï® The net exchange difference resulting from the translation of items in the financial statements of foreign integral operations is recognised as foreign exchange gain/ loss.

The financial statements of non-integral foreign operations are translated into Indian rupees as follows:

- ï® All assets and liabilities, both monetary and non-monetary, are translated using the closing rate;
- ï® Items of income and expenditure are translated at the respective monthly average rates; and
- ï® The resulting net exchange difference is credited or debited to a foreign currency translation reserve.

## m) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The premium or discount on foreign exchange forward contracts is amortized as income or expense over the life of the contract. The exchange difference is calculated and recorded in accordance with AS-11 (revised) in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts and swap contracts are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as they arise. Fair value of such option contracts and swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques considering the terms of the contract.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

Pursuant to the ICAI Announcement "Accounting for Derivatives" on the early adoption of Accounting Standard-30 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement", the Company has adopted the Standard, to the extent that the adoption does not conflict with existing mandatory accounting standards and other authoritative pronouncements, the Companies Act, 1956 and other regulatory requirements.

## Cash fl ow hedges

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified into the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/ loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, gets expired or is sold, terminated or exercised before the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, the hedge accounting on such transaction is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in hedging reserve continues to remain there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the balance in hedging reserve is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## n) Revenue recognition

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is reasonably certain, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances.

Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Accrual for chargeback, rebates, discounts and medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Accrual for such chargeback is made considering the factors such as historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers / other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Sales returns

The Company accounts for sales returns by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates.

## Profi t share revenues

From time to time the Company enters into various marketing arrangements with its business partners for the sale of its products. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the agreed price. Revenue in an amount equal to the agreed price is recognized on these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. The additional amount representing the profit share component is recognized as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measure of the profit share is available.

## Service Income

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognized in the statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Dividend and interest income

Dividend income is recognised when the unconditional right to receive the income is established. Income from interest on deposits, loans and interest bearing securities is recognised on a time proportion basis.

## Export incentives

Export incentives are recognised as reduction from cost of material consumed when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## o) Income tax expense

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit. Total tax expense is the aggregate of the amounts o f tax expense appearing in the separate fi nancial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, tax expense is not adjusted for consolidation adjustments such as elimination of unrealized intra-group profits.

## Current tax

The current charge for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the relevant tax regulations applicable to the entities in the Company.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax charge or credit reflects the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period. The deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future; however, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is a virtual certainty of realisation of such assets.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are written-down or written-up to reflect the amount that is reasonably/virtually certain (as the case may be) to be realised.

## Offsetting

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Company has a legally enforceable right to set-off assets against liabilities representing current tax, and where such deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.

## p) Earnings per share

The basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net profit after tax for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net profit after tax for the year and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the year, unless they have been issued at a later date. The diluted potential equity shares have been adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding shares).

## q) Impairment of assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (Cash Generating Unit or CGU) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its net selling price. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is refl ected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of amortised historical cost.

## r) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.

## Onerous contracts

A contract is considered as onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Company from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## s) Government grants

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction from the carrying amount of the related asset. Revenue Grants are deducted in reporting the related expense.

## t) Leases

The lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, at the inception of the lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an asset. A finance lease is recognized as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalized and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

## u) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment.

## (d) DPCO matters

The Company has received demands for payment to the credit of the Drug Prices Equalisation Account under Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1995 for few of its products which are being contested. Based on its best estimate, the Company has made a provision for the potential liability related to the overcharged amount including the interest thereon and believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of penalty on this demand is not probable. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in its litigation in the Supreme Court, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and including penalties, if any, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (e) Olanzapine, Canada litigation

The Company supplies certain generic products, including olanzapine tablets (the generic version of Eli Lilly's ZyprexaÂ® tablets) to Pharmascience, Inc. for sale in Canada. The Company's agreement with Pharmascience includes a provision pursuant to which the Company shares a portion of all cost and expense incurred as a result of settling lawsuits or paying damages that arise as a consequence of selling the products.

In November 2011, the Canadian Federal Court found the Eli Lilly Zyprexa patent invalid. This decision was upheld by the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal on 10 September 2012. On 8 November 2012, Eli Lilly filed an application for leave to appeal with Supreme Court of Canada. On 16 May 2013, the Supreme Court of Canada denied leave to appeal the Federal Court of Appeal decision.

## (f) Ibandronate Sodium United States litigation

In June 2012, the Company launched its ibandronate sodium 150 mg tablet product, a generic version of BonivaÂ® tablets, which are marketed and distributed by Genentech USA, Inc., a member of the Roche Group.

The Company is defending patent infringement actions brought by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Genentech USA, Inc., (collectively, "Roche") in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey with respect to this product. These actions were first commenced in September 2007 and over time expanded to assert infringement of four patents - one formulation patent (U.S. patent number 6,294,196) and three method of use patents (numbers 7,192,938, 7,410,957 and 7,718,634). Claims regarding U.S. patent numbers 6,294,196 and 7,192,938 were dismissed in December 2008 and April 2010, respectively.

On 7 May 2012, the Court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment that U.S. patent number 7,718,634 was invalid based on obviousness. In June 2012, the Company launched its ibandronate sodium 150 mg tablet product. On 1 October 2012, the Court granted summary judgment in the Company's favor finding U.S. patent number 7,410,957 invalid.

On 15 November 2012, the Court issued a final judgment in favor of the Company. Roche filed a motion for reconsideration on 16 November 2012 which was denied by the Court on 25 January 2013. Roche has appealed both of the Court's summary judgment decisions. Argument of the appeal was heard on 6 December 2013, and on 1 April 2014, the Court of Appeals affi rmed that the U.S. patent numbers 7,718,634 and 7,410,957 are invalid as obvious. A petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc was filed by Roche on 12 May 2014.

## (g) Nexium United States litigations

Five federal antitrust class action lawsuits have been brought on behalf of direct purchasers of Nexium, and ten federal class action lawsuits have been brought under both state and federal law on behalf of end-payors of Nexium. These actions have been filed against various generic manufacturers, including the Company and its U.S. subsidiary Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The complaints allege that, beginning in 2005, AstraZeneca sued various generic manufacturers, including the Company, for infringement with respect to patents purporting to cover AstraZeneca's branded drug, Nexium.

Plaintiffs allege that AstraZeneca's settlement agreements with these various generic manufacturers, including the Company, violated federal and state antitrust laws, as well as state unfair competition laws. The complaints seek unspecified damages for class members as a result of an alleged delay in the entry of generic versions of Nexium.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 2: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## 2.24: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company believes that each of these complaints lacks merit and that the Company's conduct complied with all applicable laws and regulations. All of the defendants, including the Company, filed motions to dismiss the complaints, which motions were denied in April 2013. The defendants also filed motions for summary judgment. Arguments regarding these motions were heard on 21 January 2014.

On 12 February 2014, the Court issued an order granting the Company's motion in part, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Company's settlement of patent litigation with AstraZeneca included a large and unjustified reverse payment. The Court refused, however, to grant the portion of the Company's motion related to the plaintiffs' conspiracy theory. A trial is likely to be conducted in late 2014.

## (h) Reclast and Zometa United States litigation

In January 2013, Novartis AG ("Novartis") brought patent infringement actions against the Company and a number of other generic companies in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Novartis asserted that the Company's ANDA for ReclastÂ® would infringe Novartis' U.S. Patent No. 8,052,987 and that the Company's ANDA for ZometaÂ® would infringe Novartis' U.S. Patent No. 8,324,189. In February 2013, Novartis sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Company and the other generic defendants from launching their generic ReclastÂ® and ZometaÂ® products. On 1 March 2013, the Court denied Novartis' motion for a temporary restraining order.

Later in March 2013, the Company launched its generic version of Novartis' ZometaÂ® Injection (zoledronic acid, 4 mg/5ml product) and in April 2013, the Company launched its generic version of Novartis' ReclastÂ® Injection (zoledronic acid, 5 mg/100ml product). After the Company launched its products, Novartis withdrew its application for a preliminary injunction. The Company believes that the asserted patents are either invalid or not infringed by the Company's products. If Novartis is ultimately successful in its patent infringement case, the Company could be required to pay damages related to the sale of its generic ReclastÂ® and ZometaÂ® products.

## i) Child resistant packaging matter

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged, in a letter dated 30 April 2014, that the Company has violated the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and intends to seek civil penalties. Simultaneously, the Department of Justice is also currently investigating a complaint related to these issues under the Federal False Claims Act. At this stage of the proceedings, the Company cannot conclude that the likelihood of an unfavourable outcome is either probable or remote in connection with this matter. Accordingly, no provision is made in the financial statements as of 31 March 2014. An unfavourable outcome in this matter that requires any significant payment by the Company could have a material adverse effect on its financial statements.

## (j) Land pollution, India

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl $\_{uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fixed at }$'$\_{ 0.0013 per acre for dry land and }$ '$\_{ 0.0017 }$ $\_{per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of }$'$\_{ 3. The Company believes that the possibility of additional liability is remote. The }$ Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT.

## (k) Water pollution and air pollution, India

During the three months ended 31 December 2011, the Company, alongwith 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board ("APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specified by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee (similar to a letter of credit) to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

NOTE 2: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## 2.24: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index issued a notification that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (l) Fuel surcharge adjustment

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") has passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Company filed separate Writs of Mandamus before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh (the "High Court") challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC for various periods.

$\_{The Company, after taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, has recorded an amount of }$'$\_{ 219 as the potential liability towards FSA }$ charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from $\_{1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is approximately }$'$\_{ 482. As of 31 March 2014, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of }$ '$\_{ 272 demanded by the power }$ distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional financial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

## (m) Assessable value of products supplied by a vendor to the Company

During the year ended 31 March 2003, the Central Excise Authorities of India ("the Central Excise Authorities") issued a demand notice to a vendor of the Company regarding the assessable value of products supplied by this vendor to the Company. The Company has been named as a co-defendant in this demand notice. The $\_{Central Excise Authorities demanded payment of }$'$\_{ 176 from the vendor, including penalties of }$ '$\_{ 90. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a }$ $\_{penalty claim of }$'$\_{ 70 against the Company. During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding }$ '$\_{ 226 from the vendor, including a penalty of }$'$\_{ 51. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of }$'$\_{ 7 against the Company. }$ $\_{Furthermore, during the year ended 31 March 2006, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding }$'$\_{ 34. }$

The Company filed appeals against these notices with Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the "CESTAT"). In October 2006, the CESTAT passed an order in favour of the Company setting aside all of the above demand notices. In July 2007, the Central Excise Authorities appealed against CESTAT's order in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi.

## 2.24: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

- (o) Direct taxes related matters

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Indian Income Tax authorities disallowed for tax purposes certain business transactions entered into by the parent company $\_{with its wholly owned subsidiaries. The associated tax impact is }$'$\_{ 658. The Company believes that such business transactions are allowed for tax deduction under }$ Indian Income Tax laws and has accordingly filed an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Hyderabad. The Company further believes that the probability of succeeding in this matter is more likely than not and therefore no provision was made in the financial statements.

- (p) Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse effect on its financial statements.

## 2.25: ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST IN A JOINT VENTURE (JV)

Kunshan Rotam Reddy Pharmaceuticals Company Limited ("KRRP")

The Company has 51.33 % interest in KRRP, a joint venture (JV) in China. KRRP is engaged in manufacturing and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates and formulations in China. The contractual arrangement between shareholders of KRRP indicates joint control as the minority shareholders, along with the Company, have significant participating rights such that they jointly control the financial and operating policies of KRRP in the ordinary course of business.

The Company has, in accordance with Accounting Standard 27 "Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures" issued under the Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules 2006, accounted for its 51.33% interest in the JV by the proportionate consolidation method. Thus the Company's statement of profit and loss, balance sheet and cash flow statement incorporate the Company's share of income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of the JV on a line-by-line basis.

The aggregate amount of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses related to the Company's share in the JV included in these financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 are given below:

## 2.31: SEGMENT REPORTING

The primary and secondary reportable segments are business and geographic segments, respectively.

## Business segments:

The Company is organised on a worldwide basis into the following businesses which are reportable segments:

- ï®ï  Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI");
- ï®ï  Global Generics; and
- ï®ï  Proprietary Products.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients: This segment includes active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediaries, also known as active pharmaceutical products or bulk drugs, which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediaries become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. This segment also includes contract research services and the manufacture and sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients and steroids in accordance with the specific customer requirements.

Global Generics: This segment consists of finished pharmaceutical products ready for consumption by the patient, marketed under a brand name (branded formulations) or as generic finished dosages with therapeutic equivalence to branded formulations (generics). This segment includes the operations of the Company's biologics business.

Proprietary Products: This segment includes the discovery and development of new chemical entities and differentiated formulations for subsequent commercialization. The Company's differentiated formulations portfolio consists of new, synergistic combinations and technologies that improve safety and/or effi cacy by modifying pharmacokinetics of existing medicines. This segment also includes the Company's specialty pharmaceuticals business, which conducts sales and marketing operations for in-licensed and co-developed dermatology products.

## Geographic segments:

The Company's business is organised into five key geographic segments viz. India, North America, Russia and other CIS countries, Europe and Others. Revenues are attributable to individual geographic segments based on the location of the customer.

Segment revenues and expenses: All segment revenues and expenses are directly attributable to the segments.

Segment assets and liabilities: As certain assets of the Company including manufacturing facilities, development facilities, and treasury assets and liabilities are often deployed interchangeably across segments, it is impractical to allocate these assets and liabilities to each segment.

Inter-segment transfers: Segment revenue, segment expenses and segment result include transfers between business segments. Inter-segment transfers are accounted for at cost to the transferring segment. Such transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

NOTE 2: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## 2.31: SEGMENT REPORTING (CONTINUED)

Accounting policies: The accounting policies consistently used in the preparation of the fi nancial statements are also applied to items of revenues and expenditure in individual segments.

Un-allocable and Head offi ce expenses: General administrative expenses, head-offi ce expenses, and other expenses that arise at the corporate level and relate to the Company as a whole, are shown as un-allocable items.

## 2.32: EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan-2002 ("the DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Under the Scheme, the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board ('the Committee') shall administer the Scheme and grant stock options to eligible directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Committee shall determine the employees eligible for receiving the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for the options issued on the date of the grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vests in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

The DRL 2002 Plan was amended on 28 July 2004 at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to provide for stock options grants in two categories:

Category A: 1,721,700 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 573,778 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares $\_{(i.e., }$'$\_{ 5/- per option). }$

The DRL 2002 Plan was further amended on 27 July 2005 at the Annual General Meeting of shareholders to provide for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares $\_{(i.e., }$'$\_{ 5/- per option).}$

The fair market value of a share on each grant date falling under Category A above is defined as the average closing price (after adjustment of Bonus issue) for 30 days prior to the grant, in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after getting the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the issue of bonus shares by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock options granted in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |

| Balance of shares that can be allotted on exercise of options (B) | 205,939                               | 1,847,685                             | 2,053,624 |
| Options arising from stock dividend (C)                           | 205,939                               | 1,847,685                             | 2,053,624 |
| Options reserved after stock dividend (A+B+C)                     | 505,939                               | 3,843,163                             | 4,349,102 |

In the case of termination of employment, all unvested options would stand cancelled. Options that have vested but have not been exercised can be exercised within the time prescribed under each option agreement by the Committee or if no time limit is prescribed, within three months of the date of employment termination, failing which they would stand cancelled.

The term of the DRL 2002 Plan expired on 29 January 2012. Consequently, the Board of Directors of the Company, based on the recommendation of the Committee, resolved to extend the term of the DRL 2002 Plan for a period of 10 years with effect from 29 January 2012, subject to the approval of shareholders. A resolution to this effect was approved by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

During the current year, the Company under the DRL 2002 Plan has issued 258,870 Catagory B options to eligible employees. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

Dr. Reddy's Employees ADR Stock Option Plan-2007 ("the DRL 2007 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2007 Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2005. The DRL 2007 Plan came into effect on approval of the Board of Directors on 22 January 2007. The DRL 2007 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively "eligible employees"). Under the DRL 2007 Plan, Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board ("the Committee") shall administer the DRL 2007 Plan and grant stock options to eligible employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Committee shall determine the employees eligible for receiving the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of the grant. The options issued under the DRL 2007 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

The Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

During the current year, the Company under the DRL 2007 Plan has issued 44,240 Category B options to eligible employees. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

The date of grant, number of options granted, exercise price fixed by the Committee for respective options and the market price of the shares of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant is given below:

The Company makes annual contributions based on a specified percentage of each covered employee's salary. The Company has no further obligations under the plan beyond its annual $\_{contributions. The Company contributed }$' $\_{63 and }$ ' $\_{56 to the superannuation plan during the year ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, respectively.}$

## Compensated leave of absence

The Company provides for accumulation of compensated absences by certain categories of its employees. These employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof as per Company policy. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences $\_{in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement.

2.36:

## EXCEPTIONAL ITEM - IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES

## Year ended 31 March 2013

## Product portfolio

During the year ended 31 March 2013, the Company determined that there was a decrease in expected cash flows of a product portfolio primarily due to higher than expected price erosion and increased competition leading to lower volumes. Consequently, the Company reassessed the recoverable amount of goodwill associated with such product $\_{portfolio using value-in-use approach and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was higher than its recoverable amount. Accordingly, an impairment loss of }$'$\_{ 427 }$ for such goodwill was recorded for the year ended 31 March 2013. For this purpose, the pre-tax cash flows have been discounted based on a pre-tax discount rate of 5.52%.

The above impairment loss relates to the Company's Global Generics segment.

## Dr. Reddy's Srl

Based on the business performance and expected cash flows from its business in Italy, the Company carried out an impairment test of Dr. Reddy's Srl's cash-generating unit $\_{and recorded an impairment loss of goodwill and intangibles amounting to }$'$\_{ 78 and }$ '$\_{ 17, respectively during the year ended 31 March 2013.}$

## Terbinafi ne

$\_{Following the Company's decision to discontinue its research and development on terbinafine nail lacquer, the Company recorded an impairment loss on intangible of }$'$\_{ 20 }$ during the year ended 31 March 2013.

## 2.37: HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS, INTEREST RATE RISKS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to exchange rate which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Russian roubles and Euros, and foreign currency debt in U.S. dollars, Russian roubles and Euros.

The Company uses forwards contracts, options contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, the Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

$\_{In respect of the aforesaid hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions, the Company has recorded, in reserves and surplus, a net loss of }$'$\_{ 1,651 and }$ '$\_{ 1,683 for the }$ $\_{year ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company also recorded, as part of revenue, a net loss of }$'$\_{ 1,093 and a net loss of }$ '$\_{ 2,576 during the year ended 31 }$ March 2014 and 2013, respectively.

$\_{The net carrying amount of the Company's "hedging reserve" in reserves and surplus before adjusting for tax impact was a loss of }$'$\_{ 1,904 as at 31 March 2014, as compared }$ $\_{to a loss of }$' $\_{253 as at 31 March 2013.}$

The table below summarizes the periods when the forecasted cash flows associated with derivative hedging instruments that are classified as cash flow hedges, are expected to occur:

## Hedges of recognized assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognized in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items are recognized as part of foreign exchange gains and losses.

Fair values of foreign exchange derivative contracts are determined under the Modified Black Scholes technique by using inputs from market observable data and other relevant terms of the contract with counter parties which are banks or financial institutions.

$\_{In respect of all of its foreign exchange derivative contracts, the Company has recorded, as part of foreign exchange gains and losses, a net loss of }$' $\_{430 and a net gain of }$ '$\_{ 501 for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, respectively.}$

The following are the outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts for hedges of recognized assets and liabilities:

## As at 31 March 2014

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

The changes in fair value of such interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognized as part of fi nance cost. Accordingly, the Company has $\_{recorded, as part of finance cost, a net gain of }$'$\_{ 259 and of }$ '$\_{ 41 for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, respectively.}$

As on 31 March 2014, the Company has outstanding interest rate swap arrangements that hedge a portion of interest rate risk arising from floating rate, dollar denominated foreign currency borrowing of USD 220 million.

## Derivative fi nancial instrument valuations:

The Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions and banks. Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts. The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing, swap models and Black Scholes models (for option valuation), using present value calculations.

$\_{The Company had derivative financial assets and derivative financial liabilities of }$'$\_{ 580 and }$ '$\_{339, respectively, as of 31 March 2014 as compared to derivative financial assets }$ $\_{and derivative financial liabilities of }$'$\_{ 562 and }$ '$\_{ 114, respectively, as of 31 March 2013, towards these derivative financial instruments.}$

## NOTE 2: NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

## 2.38: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to refl ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.

## Trade receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. As at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013 the maximum exposure $\_{to credit risk in relation to trade and other receivables is }$' $\_{33,253 and }$ '$\_{ 31,804, respectively (net of allowances).}$

## Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired

$\_{Trade receivables amounting to }$'$\_{ 24,422 and }$ '$\_{ 23,085 were neither past due nor impaired as at 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013, respectively.}$

## Trade receivables that are past due but not impaired

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The age analysis of the trade receivables has been considered from the due date of the invoice. The ageing of trade receivables that are past due, but not impaired, is given below:

## b. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

$\_{As at 31 March 2014 and 2013, the Company had unutilized credit limits from banks of }$'$\_{ 14,596 and }$ ' $\_{20,364, respectively.}$

$\_{As at 31 March 2014, the Company had working capital of }$'$\_{ 45,354 including cash and bank balances of }$ '$\_{ 23,006 and current investments of }$'$\_{ 10,664.

## c. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk-sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Roubles and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in U.S. dollars, Euros and Roubles). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's financial performance may get adversely impacted. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts are given in Note 2.37 above.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease / increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would $\_{have resulted in an approximately }$' $\_{1,254 / (945) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately }$ ' $\_{3,856 / (4,004) increase / (decrease) in the }$ Company's net profit as at 31 March 2014.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease / increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have $\_{resulted in an approximately }$'$\_{ 2,381 / (1,854) increase / (decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately }$ '$\_{ 1,478 / (1,535) increase / (decrease) in the }$ Company's net profit as at 31 March 2013.

For the year ended 31 March 2014 and 2013, every 10% depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies in the above $\_{mentioned financial assets / liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by approximately }$' $\_{1,606 and }$ '$\_{ 116, respectively, from such financial assets / liabilities.}$

## Interest rate risk

$\_{As of 31 March 2014, the Company had foreign currency loans of }$'$\_{ 34,375 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 20-179 bps and }$ '$\_{ 846 carrying a floating interest }$ $\_{rate of Moscow Prime Offered Rate plus 60 bps whereas as of 31 March 2013 foreign currency loans were}$ ' $\_{23,174 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 50-145 bps. }$ These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary. An increase or decrease of 10% in the floating interest rate component $\_{applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by }$'$\_{ 13 and }$ '$\_{4 for the year ended 31 March 2014 and 31 March 2013, respectively.}$

The Company's investments in time deposits with banks and short term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. The Company has historically not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

Consequently, an amount of }$'$\_{30 and }$ '$\_{(143) representing the actuarial gain/}$ $\_{(loss), net of }$'$\_{(14) and }$ '$\_{68 representing associated tax (expense)/benefit have been recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the years ended }$ $\_{31 March 2012 and 2013, respectively. Correspondingly, other liabilities were increased by }$'$\_{445 as of 1 April 2013. Previously, these amounts were not recorded under the }$ corridor approach specified in IAS 19.
