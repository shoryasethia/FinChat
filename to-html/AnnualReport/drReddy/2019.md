## LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN AND CO-CHAIRMAN

## G V PRASAD

Co-Chairman, Managing Director and CEO

## Dear Shareholder,

Though one needs to be circumspect in making defi nitive statements in an annual report, it is fair to say that there are clear indicators of your company's operational and fi nancial turnaround.

On the revenue side, your company witnessed impressive growth in branded generics markets, especially in India, Russia, China, Brazil and CIS countries. Other than improving the base business across these markets, we launched several new products and scaled up in new geographies like Brazil and Colombia.

However, strong pricing pressures continued unabated in the US - your company's key generics market. This was true for all generic companies, and Dr. Reddy's was no exception. Thankfully, strong revenue growth in branded generics outweighed the negative pull in the US. Consequently, your company's global generics revenue increased by 8% over the previous year.

In response to the changing conditions in this key market, we are building a differentiated pipeline for the US.

In FY2019 alone, we fi led 20 new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the USFDA. As on 31 March 2019, your company had 110 generi c fi l ings pending approval from the USFDA - comprising 107 ANDAs and three New Drug Applications (NDAs). Of the 107 ANDAs, 60 are Para IV applications, of which we believe 34 have 'First-toFile' status.

The company's pharmaceutical services and active ingredient (PSAI) business has seen a turnaround. In FY2019, revenues from PSAI grew by 10% over FY2018. In the course of the year, your company fi led 82 Drug Master Files (DMFs) across the globe, including nine in the US. The strategy of building sustainable and growing PSAI revenues involves deeper customer

relationships, new product portfolio and ramping up of base businesses in key geographies.

You will recall that in our letter to you last year, we had written: "From the beginning of FY2018 there has been a totally focused drive on eliminating needless layers and unnecessary costs." With changing dynamics of the generics markets, we believe that cost competitiveness will continue to be a key driver. Hence, we aim to continue creating a leaner and more effi cient organization.

In FY2019, our cost optimization initiatives enabled us to improve profi tability. Multi-year initiatives are now in place to drive cost and procurement effi ciencies; to optimize R&D spends and productivity; and to improve manpower throughput by delayering and eliminating needless overlaps.

Your company has also focused on constructing a leaner business model so as to create profi table growth for each of its businesses. As a part of the strategy, FY2019 saw the company selling its antibiotic formulations manufacturing facility in Bristol , US; its API manufacturing business unit at Jeedimetla, Hyderabad; and the rights to distribute and market the specialty derma brands portfolio.

We can also share some good news regarding the USFDA warning letters that had affected three of your company's manufacturing facilities: API manufacturing at Miryalaguda (Telangana) and Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh), and the oncology formulations facility at Duvvada, near Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh).

Regarding the API plant at Miryalaguda, the USFDA issued an Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) in June 2017, indicating successful closure of its audit of this facility. This facility was reinspected in January 2019, for which the USFDA issued an EIR

in May, 2019. Similarly, in February 2019, the USFDA issued an EIR for the oncology formulations facility at Duvvada and has determined the inspection classifi cation of this facility as Voluntary Action Initiated (VAI). In March 2019, we responded to the follow-up questions from USFDA regarding the API facility in Srikakulam. Based on the subsequent discussion with USFDA, we expect a reinspection will be conducted for the site.

## WHAT IS OUR VIEW OF THE NEAR FUTURE?

We believe that pricing pressures will continue to aff ect all players in generics in the US.

Overcoming this necessitates a robust pipeline of complex formulations with limited competition - a pipeline that allows your company to introduce several value-added products each year, and thus make up for price erosions on the earlier launched products.

As touched upon earlier in this letter, we have such a pipeline - of 110 generi c fi l ings awaiting approval from the USFDA. We have to leverage this and ensure that we succeed in delivering these products, molecule by molecule, to the US on the due dates. As we wrote last year, "We have to do this without fail, and with best-inclass cost. That is the way out."

Given the challenges in the US market, we will continue our eff orts to diversify our market presence. We will leverage our global portfolio of products in markets outside the US to drive growth. We will also refocus some of our R&D resources to service the high potential branded generics markets such as China, Russia and other Emerging Markets. This is an important element of our geographical diversifi cation and new market entry strategy - to lead with high value products and go-to-market partnerships.

India will continue to be important. We have seen a 12% growth in revenues in FY2019 and improved our market ranking by three places.

We shall propel further growth in our PSAI business. These moves should reduce our dependence on the US and also help us generate sustained growth and profitability to counter-balance volatility of the unbranded generics markets.

We remain focused on improving quality across all aspects of our operations, with initiatives for continuous improvement, reducing manual interventions through digitization and shop fl oor training programs to constantly upgrade the culture of quality. We intend to continue this journey and meet the highest regulatory standards across markets.

Given your company's signifi cantly improved performance in FY2019, the success in improving operational effi ciencies and our determination to drive growth, we are reasonably optimistic of the prospects for FY2020.

Our thanks to the management team, all employees and partners for coming together to deliver better results. And our thanks to you for your support.

With best regards,

K SATISH REDDY Chairman

## Hervycta® - accelerating access to innovative and aff ordable medicines

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Breast cancer is the most common cancer amongst Indian women$^{1}$. Although signifi cant strides have been taken in developing anti-cancer medication, a majority of cancer patients cannot afford its treatment costs and do not have access to the most advanced drugs.

The biologic drug, trastuzumab, is one of the few approved and eff ective treatment options for HER2+ breast cancer, but the cost of treatment is high and drug accessibility is low in India. Our Biologics team took up this challenge of bringing the much-needed treatment within the reach of Indian breast cancer patients. We launched the trastuzumab biosimilar, Hervycta®, in 2018.

The story, however, didn't end at developing the drug. We also wanted to understand and address little known unmet needs which can make a huge diff erence in treatment outcomes. Before launching Hervycta®, we engaged with multiple stakeholders to gain insights into their beliefs towards the disease, so we could take cancer care beyond the drug.

and its treatment. This leads to denial fi rst, followed by a reluctance to accept, and then a tendency to postpone, which aff ects treatment outcomes eventually.

The Hervycta® website was launched to provide comprehensive information on the symptoms, risk factors, diagnosis, treatment and answers to questions that patients and caregivers frequently have. The website uses infographics for clarity and is easy to navigate.

Hervycta® Pluspack, a unique user centric packaging was launched to facilitate proper storage, drug protection and communicate proper handling instructions for the drug. It's a compact carton divided into two compartments with an inbuilt tray to store the drug and the diluent vials separately and safely. The compartments are easy to tear off , making it convenient to retain and store any unused reconstituted drug solution safely.

As Hervycta® continues to enable thousands of women fight HER2+ breast cancer, we remain committed to using science to address unmet needs of patients.

We realized that a key reason for the low rate of diagnosis and high mortality in breast cancer is the lack of awareness and availability of authentic information about the disease

## Accelerating access to generics to treat opioid addiction

Opioid addiction can disrupt normal, healthy functioning of the brain. This brain disruption can be long-lasting, and can lead to potentially harmful behavior, irrespective of age, sex, or socio-economic status. If left untreated, it may cause severe consequences. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the total national economic burden of prescription opioid misuse alone is nearly US$ 80 billion a year. Doctors can medically treat opioid addiction with buprenorphine and naloxone.

In June 2018, we received FDA's approval to market a generic version of Suboxone® (buprenorphine and naloxone) sublingual fi l m. This approval came after the conclusion of litigation in the US District Court for the District of Delaware, where the Court concluded that the patents asserted against us covering Suboxone® sublingual fi lm would not be infringed by our generic sublingual fi lm product.

On 14 June 2018, we became the fi rst company to launch a generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual fi lm product in the US and it demonstrated our ability to successfully manufacture complex generics. Following this launch, Indivior PLC ("Indivior"), the owner of the Suboxone® NDA product, fi led for an injunction to ban further manufacturing and

sales of our buprenorphine and naloxone generic in the Trial Court of US District Court for the District of New Jersey. Pending a full hearing and decision on the injunction application, the said Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), effective the day after commencement of shipping in the US market. The TRO halted further sales and shipments, but not manufacturing. On 13 July 2018, the Trial Court converted the TRO into a preliminary injunction on commercialization activities. We then immediately appealed the preliminary injunction decision to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which agreed to expedite the appeal.

On 20 November 2018, the Court of Appeals vacated the preliminary injunction. Subsequently, Indivior fi led a further petition for rehearing which was denied. This required another three months to navigate through the appeals process. Finally, we resumed shipping and sales of the product on 20 February 2019.

This long and successful fi ght for the right to launch this product has been an important milestone for us. It strengthens our commitment to provide aff ordable treatment for opioid addiction and other medical conditions plaguing patients and communities worldwide.

## XCEED - enhancing engagement with customers and prospects

Our partners are on a mission to bring medicines to patients faster. Accessing real time information about products and their business with us is key to improving their operational effi ciency.

To help customers make better business decision, our Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI) division embarked on a digital transformation initiative with primary objectives - to create an exemplary service experience for our customers, increase engagement, acquire new customers and generate leads.

We started by carrying out an end-to-end evaluation of a customer's journey with us - from enquiring and ordering to payment. We identifi ed the areas that needed improvement in internal processes, designed new and more effi cient process fl ows, and set targets for service turnaround time based on past performance, aspirations, and customer expectations.

We fi rst launched the easy-to-navigate API and CPS websites, which were designed to help customers understand our business and offerings better. The websites also opened a new channel for lead generation.

Our customer service platform, XCEED was launched in April 2019, which was a huge step up towards improving customer experience and facilitating collaboration. Customers across the globe are now able to manage the whole business process in real time - from ordering samples to submitting and tracking orders providing convenience and transparency.

The platform also allows customers to closely interact with our interdisciplinary support team. Customer service and XCEED as a platform would be one of the biggest diff erentiators in PSAI's aspiration to be numero uno. We will continue to build on the foundation of our websites and customer service platform to help our customers further improve their operational effi ciency and deeply engage with prospects.

## Briviact® - Ensuring epilepsy drug availability in India

There are more than 12 million epilepsy patients in India. Although they lead a fairly normal life, the threat of recurrent seizures imposes a lot of restrictions on their daily activities - from being dissuaded from driving a vehicle to participating in sports. At times, seizures leave them with a sense of embarrassment, especially in the public place.

Epilepsy, being a chronic condition, can only be managed using anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). Poorly controlled seizures can be detrimental and have signifi cant impact on daily activities for people aff ected. As many as one third of people with epilepsy are currently uncontrolled on their existing medicines. These patients can require multiple drugs which increases pill burden and chances of adverse events.

UCB, the Belgium based biopharmaceutical company, whom we have been partnering with since 2015, developed the Brivaracetam (branded as Briviact®) drug with anticonvulsant properties. In phase 3 trial, patients treated with Brivaracetam as an adjunctive medication had better seizure control than the placebo control group. Moreover, Briviact® has potential to provide additional value for patients - both today and in future.

We collaborated with UCB to market Briviact® in India and launched the drug in July 2018. Since the launch, we have seen excellent responses with 500 healthcare practitioners and 5000 patients benefi ting from the therapy so far. We still hear heartwarming stories of the impact Briviact® has had on patients' lives, almost every day.

We are always looking for opportunities to bring medicines within the reach of patients. Here was another opportunity.

## SECTION E PRINCIPLE-WISE PERFORMANCE

## PRINICIPLE 1

## ETHICS, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

- 1. Does the policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption cover only the company? Does it extend to the group/joint ventures/suppliers/ contractors/ NGOs/others?

Yes. The policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption extends beyond our employees, both whole-time and independent directors and covers our wholly owned subsidiaries. While contracts with our suppliers, contractors and business partners include adherence to our principles concerning ethics, there is a separate code of conduct required to be adhered to by our suppliers and service providers.

- 2. How many stakeholder complaints have been received in the pastfi nancial year and what percentage was satisfactorily resolved by the management?

We have a hotline for whistle-blowers and receiving concerns. The concerns received are dealt with according to our Ombudsperson policy. During the year ended 31 March 2019, we have received and resolved 176 complaints after due investigation.

## PRINCIPLE 2

## PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY

- 1. List up to 3 of your products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/ or opportunities.
- i. ROXADUSTAT
- ii. Continuous Manufacturing - API-1 (Atorvastatin Calcium)
- iii. Continuous Manufacturing - API-2 (Flozins Intermediate)
- 2. For each such product, provide the following details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of product (optional):
- i. Reduction during sourcing/ production/distribution achieved since the previous year throughout the value chain.

<!-- image -->

- ii. Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) has been achieved since the previous year.
- (i) ROXADUSTAT
- We have continued to apply and embed 12 principles of green chemistry in our research and development pursuits. We identifi ed a synthesis of ROXADUSTAT in which a regioselective opening of anhydride ring and Pd metal free C-C bond formation aiming to develop an innovative, greener and cost effective route [relatively less Raw Material Cost (RMC)] to meet the business needs without compromising on the environmental considerations. In this endeavour, we have reduced the Process Mass Intensity (PMI) substantially close to 90% of innovator's route.
- (ii) Continuous Manufacturing - API-1 The pharmaceutical industry has so far relied on batch processes for manufacturing drug substance as well as drug products. However, longer campaign times, labour intensive nature of batch manufacturing (which has a signifi cant impact on production cost), and batch rejections/batch to batch variations in the product quality (which leads to wastage/regulatory concerns)

are huge drawbacks of batch processing. In addition, an increasing pressure on quality and costs has all led the pharma industry towards gradually embracing the concept of continuous manufacturing.

Continuous manufacturing offers many advantages such as shorter processing times, increased safety, increased effi ciency, less WIP material, lesser manual handling and smaller footprint. It is also amenable to Real Time Release testing approaches.

Our API team has embarked upon this journey & signifi cant progress is done.

An existing batch process of high volume API (Atorvastatin Calcium) consisting of multiple chemical conversions and unit operations is being redeveloped to generate a completely integrated system starting from raw materials to dried API via fl ow processing. In current process, there are three chemical conversions followed by unit operations of crystallization, fi ltration, drying & powder processing. There is isolation and quality testing of compounds at each of these steps.

A lean continuous manufacturing process is developed using fl ow chemistry principles wherein:

<!-- image -->

Number of organic solvents is reduced and overall solvent consumption/kg. of API is reduced by ~50%

- Isolations at all intermittent steps are eliminated.
- Flow approach has enabled to explore design space that would be impractical (even impossible) in batch mode. This has led to signifi cant reduction in reaction time from hours to minutes for all chemical conversions.
- Number of organic solvents is reduced and overall solvent consumption/kg. of API is reduced by ~50%.
- Overall cycle time of manufacturing API is reduced from days to few hours.

This process has been successfully tested at pilot scale. Benefi ts of this approach, when implemented at commercial level, are smaller footprint, reduction in manual intervention, reduction in overhead costs etc.

- (iii) Continuous Manufacturing - API-2 In this product, a highly exothermic & hazardous reaction involving use of n-Butyllithium has been designed & optimised in fl ow using V apourtecfl ow reactor at lab . Rig, which is designed for scale up to plant, is installed at CTO-SEZ and few trials have been taken to establish fl ow process at plant scale. Better control on reaction and inherent safety is achieved by changing this reaction from batch to fl ow.
- 3. Does the company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing (including transportation)? If yes, what percentage of your inputs was sourced sustainably? Yes, we have well defi ned and documented 'Supplier Code of Conduct' addressing all sustainable sourcing elements like ethics, labor & human rights, wages & benefi ts, health and

safety, promote diversity, quality education, environment, process simplifi cation, management systems including bribery and corruption.

Dedicated resources are involved in sustainable sourcing activities including capacity building, developing long-term supplier partnerships, vendor development and performance management, and sharing best practices among all strategic business partners. We have a dedicated team for supply risk mitigation program to develop alternate vendors, wherever single vendors are considered critical for business continuity.

We have undertaken several simplifi cation projects to improve our logistics in recent years. Few such initiatives are:

- Indigenization of supplies: Localization has led to lowering of procurement costs and improvement in overall quality of the products, and when the materials are delivered with shorter lead-times, with complete compliance control (especially temperature sensitive RMS) and lower logistics costs. This substitution generates a range of environmental benefi ts including social-economic factors, better carbon footprint with reduced consumption of non-renewable energy sources.
- Transportation Load Builder (TLB): To support fi nished goods distribution in India, a TLB application has been designed which tracks the stock status of materials at warehouses vis-à-vis the desired target stock levels and automatically prompts for stock transfer to replenish the defi cits at the sales warehouse. It minimizes the transportation costs by creating transfer proposals using the truck sizes defi ned for each transportation lane and optimizing the Full Truck Load (FTL). With this project, we are also:
- 1. Identifying SKU sales warehouse combinations where business is at risk of losing sales due to stock outs or low coverage;
- 2. Ensuring product availability;
- 3. Reducing manual intervention in the process; and
- 4. Maximizing truck loads reducing overall cost.
- Air vs Sea shipment: - We have a process in place to monitor the overall air vs sea shipments to maximize the export shipments by sea, and yearly plans are laid-down (market specifi c targets are assigned) for the fi nished goods movement from air to sea and to effectively reduce carbon footprint in our supply chain. In the reporting period, we have avoided 42,165 tons of carbon emission with this program in place.
- 4. Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services from local & small producers, including communities surrounding their place of work? If yes, what steps have been taken to improve their capacity and capability of local and small vendors?

Yes, we have procedures in place to procure goods and services from local producers.

Presently ~70% of our procurements are from domestic producers and ~30% from international producers.

Dedicated resources are assigned the job of improving capacity and capabilities of local producers. The following are some of the initiatives:

- Encouraging local manufacturers to develop and manufacture such materials where the import dependency is 100%.
- Providing long-term commitments on business continuity.
- Few packaging material suppliers were encouraged to set-up unit close to our manufacturing site at Baddi, Himachal Pradesh.
- Sharing good practices via audits and workshops.
- Mandatory supplier trainings for new vendors.
- Ensuring that the supplier payment terms for small producers is not more than 45 days.
- Inculcating culture of resource conservations among local producers with regard to improved solvent recovery effi ciencies and eliminating usage of hazardous solvents.
- Nurtured small entrepreneurs with both fi nancial and technical support in order to raise their competency to meet our and current market expectations.

<!-- image -->

- 5. Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and wastes? If yes, what is the percentage of recycled products and wastes.

We have taken a target to go for zero solid waste to landfi ll by the end of 2020. For the same we have taken a few initiatives to reuse/recycle the waste.

Total 17,678* tons of hazardous waste was generated during the reporting period. Out of the total hazardous waste generated, 94.6% of the waste was sent to cement industries for co-processing thereby eliminating off site incineration. Almost 4.6% waste was sent for recycling.

Thus, 99.2% of hazardous waste was co-processed or recycled. Our API facilities have already achieved zero solid waste to landfi ll. We have strengthened our efforts to be 100% zero waste to landfi ll by 2020.

Pharmaceutical Services & Active Ingredients (PSAI), which accounts for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Custom Pharmaceutical Services (CPS).

Through our portfolio of products and services, we operate in multiple therapeutic areas - the major ones being gastrointestinal, oncology, cardiovascular, pain management, central nervous system (CNS), anti-infective, respiratory and dermatology.

We are present in several countries across the world, with the key geographies being the US, Europe, India and Russia.

After the last couple of years, when we had to deal with extremely diffi cult market conditions on account of intense price competition, channel consolidation

in the US, regulatory hurdles and consequential delays in launches of new products, FY2019 witnessed much better performance for us. Though challenges continued in terms of pricing pressure in the US as well as in Europe, we were able to grow signifi cantly in the branded markets - India, Russia and several other emerging markets.

In addition, continued focus on cost control and creating a leaner and more de-layered business model helped to improve profi ts. The financial performance also benefi ted due to depreciation of rupee against the US dollar.

Improved fi nancial performance in FY2019 were on account of the following factors:

- 1. Growth in the branded generics markets: we saw good growth across key branded markets, namely India, Russia, Brazil, CIS countries and some other regions. We improved our base business across these markets, launched new products and scaled up in new geographies like Brazil and Colombia. The initial hiccups faced during the GST transition in India in FY2018 were settled, and the business was back to normal in FY2019.
- 2. Executing measures for prudent cost control: We embarked on a journey to prune our cost structures to be more productive and eliminate waste across the businesses. Robust initiatives were put in place to drive cost effi ciencies in manufacturing; to improve procurement effi ciencies; to optimize on research and development expenditure and productivity; and to apply productivity metrices on marketing spends. In addition, several measures were undertaken to improve manpower productivity, such as restructuring the levels of hierarchy, delayering and eliminating overlaps.
- 3. Creating a leaner business model: Our renewal strategy includes achieving self-sustainability, streamlining and optimizing global cost structures to create profi table growth for each of its businesses. During FY2019, as part of this strategy, we sold (a) the antibiotic formulations manufacturing facility and related assets in Bristol, (b) the API manufacturing business

unit at Jeedimetla, Hyderabad, and (c) the rights to distribute and market the specialty derma brands portfolio. These, and other such initiatives, should signifi cantly contribute in focusing each business to drive future growth.

## A SNAPSHOT OF PERFORMANCE GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

- Revenue from GG in FY2019 was ₹ 122.9 billion , which represented an increase of 8% compared to the previous year. This growth was largely attributable to impressive performances witnessed in the Emerging Markets and in India.
- Revenue from North America Generics (NAG) was ₹ 60 billion , which remained more or less fl at compared to FY2018. There was a growth in volumes for certain base products, coupled with the full year benefi ts of products launched during the second half of previous year. Growth was further supported by 24 new products which were launched during the year - the major ones being Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual fi lms, Levetiracetam bags, Colesevelam, Hydroxychloroquine and Thiotepa injection. However, due to an increase in competitive intensity, there were signifi cant price erosions for some key products such as Sevelamer, Decitabine Injection, Metoprolol and Valgancyclovir.
- In FY2019, we filed 20 new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the USFDA . As on 31 March 2019 we had 110 generic fi lings pending approval from the USFDA comprising 107 ANDAs and three New Drug Applications (NDAs) fi led under the Section 505(b)(2) route of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Of the 107 ANDAs, 60 are Para IV applications, of which we believe 34 have 'First to File' status.
- Revenue from Europe was ₹ 7.9 billion , representing a decline of 4% versus FY2018. This was primarily on account of lower sales revenue in the United Kingdom, largely due to high price erosion on some of our products
- - which was partially off set by an increase in revenue from Germany.
- Revenue from Emerging Markets was ₹ 28.9 billion , a growth of 28% compared to FY2018. This expansion was largely on account of increased revenues from our base business, new product launches and relatively rapid scaling up of business in some of the new markets.
- - Revenue from Russia was ₹ 15.3 billion , representing a year-on-year growth of 21%.
- - Revenue from other CIS countries and Romania was ₹ 5.2 billion , an annual growth of 34%.
- - Revenue from Rest of the World (RoW) territories was ₹ 8.4 billion , a year-on-year growth of 36%.
- Revenue from India was ₹ 26.2 billion , which represented a growth of 12% compared to FY2018. This revenue growth was largely attributable to an increase in both sales volume and price of our existing products, as well as additional revenue from the launch of new products. During FY2019, we launched 15 new brands in India.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

Revenues from PSAI stood at ₹ 24.1 billion , or a growth of 10% versus FY2018. During the year, we fi led 82 Drug Master Files (DMFs) worldwide including nine fi lings in the US.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

Revenues from PP was ₹ 4.7 billion, this translated to a growth of 12% versus FY2018 and was largely due to sale and assignment of the US rights relating to the dermatology brands.

Robust initiatives were put in place to drive cost effi ciencies in manufacturing; to improve procurement effi ciencies; to optimize sales and marketing spend, and improve productivity on research and development expenditure.

## GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET OUTLOOK 1

Across the world, the global pharmaceutical industry had to deal with political uncertainty, increased pricing pressures, consolidation in general and channel consolidation in particular, higher pressure on payors to reduce healthcare costs, increased patient empowerment, more stringent regulatory environment, and lower number of approvals by the USFDA.

Though not new to the industry, these challenges had to be dealt with increased intensity and rigor. To do so, the industry had to focus on structural changes. Some of these were: (i) newer business models, (ii) increased focus on productivity using leaner and more integrated models, (iii) targeting of new markets, (iv) inorganic capability building, (v) higher adoption and leveraging of new technologies, (vi) increased emphasis on diff erentiation, (vii) focusing on unmet patient needs, and (viii) even foraying into new and advance dfi elds of science.

Such a transitional journey is inevitable. The challenge, however, lies in arriving at the desired mix of the key essentials including, but not necessarily limited to, patient centricity, diff erentiation, technology adoption, preferred level of scientifi c innovation and portfolio choices.

Thus, the industry is at a juncture where seismic shifts and structural challenges are rampant. Yet, at the same time, the outlook is quite positive.

According to IQVIA (formerly Quintiles and IMS Health Inc.) in its January 2019 report, the global pharmaceutical industry is expected to exceed US$ 1.5 trillion by 2023 growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of anywhere between 3% and 6%. Some of the report's major conclusions are given below.

- The key drivers of growth will continue to be the US and the 'Pharmerging' markets with the former expected to show a CAGR of 4-7% and the latter of 5-8%.
- Prescription drug sales are expected to grow at a CAGR exceeding 6.4% for

2018-24 and reach US$ 1.2 trilliona signifi cant increase in the annual growth rate compared to around 1.2% for period 2011-17.

- This growth will be augmented by a continued uptick and anticipated launch of novel therapies addressing key unmet needs, faster approvals, favorable demographics as well as increasing access to medicines globally.
- However, more active payor scrutiny, sales losses from genericization and biosimilar competition will act as brakes on this growth.

Some key trends which are expected to defi ne the pharmaceutical space in the near future are worth noting. These are:

- A range of novel technologies, such as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and CRISPR/Cas9, and others involving modifi ed cells or gene-modifi cation tools are under development. These technologies are expected to treat limited patient populations and raise important questions for healthcare stakeholders around cost and accessibility.
- Mobile apps are being increasingly submitted to the USFDA for clearance and approval. These prescription digital therapeutics (DTx) are becoming a new treatment modality with indications and disease-specifi c treatment eff ectiveness claims in their prescribing labels.
- Over the next five years, life sciences companies will continue to develop and invest in artifi cial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning programs leading to breakthroughs impacting the discovery and development of medicines.
- Manufacturers of new medicines where safety has been well demonstrated, but where additional or alternative uses of drugs have not yet been approved, will incorporate real-world evidence to support approval for novel indications.
- Pharmaceutical companies will continue hiring specialists in patient care and patient advocacy, with most of the top 20 pharma companies

having a senior level patient advocacy role by 2019.

- In response to stakeholder perceptions in the US that they are paying inappropriately high costs for medicines, the federal government has proposed a sweeping set of pricing reforms for government programs each with varying levels of impact and probability of being enacted.
- There will be more emerging biopharma (EBP) companies launching new medicines in the next five years. It is estimated that over one-third of drugs launched in the next five years will be brought to market by these EBP enterprises.
- The next five years will pose a number of challenges to biopharmaceutical companies, especially with payor actions on prices. It remains to be seen whether these companies can repeat their past successes in terms of cost management.
- Existing policies and new legislations will aff ect opioid prescribing and use right up to 2023. The dynamics around prescription opioids, plus the issues around illicit drug use and overdoses, will remain complex and challenging to address.

To assess the market potential and outlook, it is useful to dwell upon the opportunities

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

and challenges. Given below are a few notable opportunities for the global pharmaceutical industry:

Orphan Drugs: The orphan drugs sector is expected to continue outperforming the market almost doubling during 2018-2024 to reach US$ 262 billion, and accounting for approximately 20% of prescription sales in 2024. This highlights the industry's continued move to address small groups of neglected patients with high unmet need and to benefi t from regulatory an d fi nancial incentives.

- Orphan drugs are expected to represent 45% of new active substances - provided the level of USFDA orphan designations for inprocess and break-through research produce the anticipated results, in line with current and historic trends.
- Though the patient population will be limited, the price per patient shall be increasingly higher. Average median prices are expected to be above US$ 100,000 per year by 2023.
- However, new launch prices may increase at a slower rate thanks to a combination of factors such as price competition with other innovative molecules and independent review of pricing by regulatory bodies like the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER). Having said so, once these hurdles are overcome, the prices will continue to rise incrementally.

Gene and Cell Therapies: Gene and cell therapy is no longer a distant possibility but a reality. Building on the approval and launch of CAR-T therapies in 2017 and the launch of Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics), the fi rst USFDA approved gene therapy for vision loss in 2018, these treatments are expected to gain momentum and should increasingly contribute to growth. This space though is not devoid of various challenges including commercialization,

market access, patient and physician adoption, cost/benefit discussions, reimbursement and manufacturing scale-up. Despite these challenges, the area is generating enormous interest. There has been a surge in activity, and new therapeutic areas are being targeted which are being augmented with a healthy pipeline.

- According to December 2018 report on 'Medicines in Development', five diseases are being currently targeted with cell and gene therapies. Over 100 diseases are being explored for potential treatment, and nearly 300 cell and gene therapies are in development - either in clinical trials or awaiting review with the USFDA.

Biologics and Biosimilar: One should expect to see a greater number of USFDA biosimilar approvals in 2019, as more innovator biologics reach their market exclusivity expiration.

- Although the US still lags behind the EU - with only a third of the number of biosimilar approvals - this is set to change.
- The latest biosimilar report from PharmSource, a GlobalData product, shows that we are entering the third wave of opportunity for biosimilar makers, with 66 innovator biologics due to come off -patent in the US between 2020 and 2025. Consequently, there should be an increasing number of biosimilar review applications to the USFDA.
- The current volume of clinical development candidates indicate there will be more biosimilar approvals in the future from companies based in Europe and Asia - especially China and India than those from the US.

Artifi cial Intelligence (AI) to improve productivity: In the pharmaceutical

AI will be critical to the future of pharma as the amount of available data and number of monitoring devices increase.

industry, there is enormous scope for increasing effi ciency, particularly in drug development, where it often lacks the necessary capital to run large trials and testing. At the same time, AI is maturing from hype to more tangible use. The predictive and analytic powers of AI should enable companies to make smarter, faster and more strategic decisions. AI will increase drug development effi ciency by not wasting research eff orts - for example, by creating alternative hypotheses for trials by discovering more data to enable drug repurposing. Additionally, the infl ux of data from new devices will enable real-time, on-the-go, instant results.

AI will be critical to the future of pharma as the amount of available data and number of monitoring devices increase. In the short term, it will have a real impact through its ability to collect and aggregate disparate data sets and identify patterns which in turn will generate more insights. The real potential of AI and machine learning will be in enabling pharma companies to be smarter, faster, and more cost effi cient.

Industry-Wide Consolidation: Every segment of the pharmaceutical industry is expected to continue witnessing consolidation throughout 2019.

- In recent past, there were two high profi le acquisitions of oncologyfocused big pharma companies - of BMS acquiring Celgene, and of Eli Lilly purchasing Loxo.
- Other innovators are expected to follow with transformational or bolt-on deals to secure competitive positions in specialty and rare disease indications. Additional consolidation is also likely in generics, to further stabilize price erosion and add new, high-barrier-toentry products to portfolios.
- Shifting regulatory demands, particularly in markets like China, may also help to drive consolidation.
- On the contract development and manufacturing side, M&A will continue to be important to compete at scale, offer full lines of complementary or integrated services, and secure the newest technologies, particularly as drug pipelines increasingly fi ll with cell-based therapies or other highly complex formulations.
- The healthcare industry also saw several big vertical integrations in 2018 - such as Aetna with CVS, and Cigna with Express Scripts.

These deals have been justifi ed as opportunities to gain effi ciency and lower cost of care, but it is still too early to determine their long-term impact. The trend will likely continue in 2019 as the industry looks for new ways to control costs and increase margins.

Outlook for the US Market: According to a recent IQVIA report, while the invoice spend in the US is expected to grow at a rate of 4% to 7% to US$ 600 billion by 2023, the net growth in manufacturers' revenue will be a bit lower, at 3% to 6%. Growth is expected to be driven by new products and brand pricing, which shall partially be offset by patent expiries and generic launches after the expiry of market exclusivity.

- With cardiovascular diseases and cancer continuing to remain the leading causes of death in the US, there has been an increased shift in focus towards list prices of recently launched drugs.
- In recent times, there has been a spurt in cases where price increases by manufacturers on established products have come under greater scrutiny by the public and policy makers.
- Cost containment measures such as price and reimbursement cuts are leading to tougher market conditions for drug manufacturers and shrinking profi t margins. In response to these pressures, companies are reassessing their strategies and market focus.

## Value Based Pricing (VBP): Payors,

insurers and hospitals are no longer willing to pay simply for a product; but are looking for VBP which is dependent upon success of the products and procedures through measurable outcomes. Although VBP comes with its share of risks and challenges, there is a large potential to

<!-- image -->

create a win-win situation for multiple healthcare stakeholders if structured and implemented correctly.

Rise of China: Despite concerns about a trade war between the US and China, it is not a surprise that China is still viewed as a huge market opportunity for the pharmaceutical industry. With its huge population and growing middle class, it has become a leader in R&D innovation for medicine, particularly regenerative medicine - and perhaps even gene-editing based on the news from late 2018.

- China has expanded to being the second largest pharmaceutical market globally with US$ 137 billion in total spend in 2018 and a CAGR of 8% during 2013-18.
- Much of the growth has been driven by the Central Government's reforms to increase insurance access to both rural and urban residents; to expand and modernize the hospital system; and to better integrate primary care services. Broader economic growth has enabled more Chinese patients to access and aff ord medicines; and per capita rates of use and spending have risen signifi cantly.
- Recent regulatory reforms are expected to act as an impetus to the pharmaceutical landscape. These involve realignment of regulatory agencies, including the State Medical Insurance Administration (SMIA) and State Drug Administration (SDA), to drive consistency, speed and effi ciency in implementation of policies; hospital reforms to reduce the profi t motive; and improved co-ordination with primary care to support the expected expansion of hospitals without major burden on the government.

- To manage affordability for the government programs and the population in general, the Chinese government has focused on managing drug pricing through the use of an Essential Drug List (EDL) and a National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). Both require manufacturers to offer substantial discounts. In return, listing on the NRDL off ers wider access to the population. The NRDL had been updated periodically: in 2001, 2004, and 2009 with the most recently in 2017 after an eight-year gap. Adoption of newer medicines from this updated reimbursement list will drive signifi cant growth for novel brands, while unbranded generic medicines and locally manufactured non-original brands are expected to grow slowly.
- Though the reforms are encouraging, the big challenge that still remains is how to best navigate the Chinese regulatory and commercial landscape.

Better life expectancy and lower mortality rates culminating in an aging global population: The United Nations projects that the global life expectancy will reach beyond 75 years by the year 2050. This means that the number of elderly people will see a substantial increase in the years to come. It is projected that this number will globally rise to over 19% in 2050.

- For the developed regions, individuals aged 60 and over will make up one-third of their population, while for developing nations it will consist of one-fi fth.
- With increasing age, disabilities and chronic diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, respiratory and heart problems are expected to involve repeated and, hence expensive health treatments. Nations will need to improve their healthcare systems so they can provide better yet more costeffective treatment for the elderly.

## OUR MARKET PERFORMANCE, FY2019

## NORTH AMERICA GENERICS (NAG)

NAG is our largest market. In FY2019, it contributed to around 49% of the GG sales, and 39% of our overall sales.

Revenue from the region for FY2019 was ' 60 billion (US$ 862 million), representing an almost flat growth of 0.2% over the previous year . As mentioned earlier, the year was challenging on account of signifi cant price erosion faced due to increased competition across some of the major products. The negative impact was off set by increase in volumes for some of our base products and new product launches - the major ones being Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual fi l m, Levetiracetam bags, Colesevelam, Hydroxychloroquine and Thiotepa injection. Some key developments were:

- Launched Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual fi lm, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Suboxone®, a combination medication which is used to treat opioid use disorder.
- Launched Levetiracetam bags, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of HQ Specialty Pharma Corporation's Levetiracetam in Sodium Chloride Injection, which is used as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in adults with epilepsy, when oral administration is temporarily not feasible.
- Launched Colesevelam tablets, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Welchol® tablets, which is used to reduce the amount of cholesterol and certain fatty substances in the blood.
- Gained signifi cant market share in certain key products such as Liposomal Doxorubicin and Atorvastatin.
- Filed 20 new ANDAs, which comprise some complex products and are across different dosage forms.

Our current priority includes timely new product launches and focus on increasing market share of existing products without destroying the value of these drugs. The strategy is to signifi cantly expand our portfolio and ensure right cost structures for our products to be able to compete in this highly competitive market.

We will continue to focus on complex formulations - primarily injectables and oral solid dosage forms - as well as OTC brands in the medium term, and 505(b)(2) generics, controlled substances under class II, and non-substitutable generics in the longer term.

## EMERGING MARKETS

Revenue from Emerging Markets for FY2019 was ' 28.9 billion , representing a growth of 28% compared to the previous year. This signifi cant growth has been a result of increased revenues from our base business, new product launches and scale up of business in new markets.

Revenue from Russia for FY2019 was ' 15.3 billion, representing a 21% growth over the previous year. The growth was 26% in terms of the local currency (ruble).

- In Russia, we launched OTC Nasivin during Q4 FY2018, an in-licensed product, which gained good traction in volumes in FY2019.
- Our key products - such as Nise, Omez, Ketorol, Cetrine, Ciprolet, Ibuclin, Nise gel, Novigan, Plagril, Razo, Naisivin and Femibion - continue to be brand leaders (each among the top three) in their respective categories, as reported by IMS Health in its report for the 12-month period ended 31 March 2019.

Revenue from CIS countries (including Romania) was ' 5.2 billion, representing 34% growth over the previous year. The growth was led by Kazakhstan, Romania and Ukraine through the increasing sale of existing products as well as new launches.

During FY2018, we had entered Brazil, Turkey and Algeria. In FY2019, we scaled up our business in these markets. Further we entered in some select ASEAN markets. Our focus is primarily on institution business in most of these countries through biosimilars and oncology products. We have also grown well in China and expect it to be a relatively high growth market in the next few years.

Our strategy for growth in Emerging Markets is to continue improving our market share in our chosen therapy areas, including expansion of biosimilars and the oncology portfolio. We will focus on scaling up in our major markets, which include Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine.

## EUROPE

Revenue from Europe in FY2019 was

' 7.9 billion , representing a decline of 4% vis-a-vis the previous year. This was on account of lower sales in the UK, which was partly off set by increasing revenues from Germany. Revenue growth was impacted due to price erosion in few of our key products, coupled with temporary supply disruptions, and delays in some of the launches. The supply issues have been largely resolved and we expect this market to register growth in FY2020.

We launched multiple new products in Germany and the UK during the year and also continued making inroads into the newly entered countries of France, Italy, and Spain. Currently, Europe comprises 6% of our global generics sales. In the medium to long-term, we expect to grow this share by leveraging our in-house portfolio, seeking in-licensing opportunities, and scaling up business in the three new countries.

## INDIA

Revenue from India in FY2019 was ' 26.2 billion , or a growth of 12% compared to previous year. According to the IQVIA in its report for the 12-month period ended 31 March 2019, our growth has been 11.3% versus a market growth of 10.5%. During the year, we improved our market rank by three places - from number 16 as per MAT (March 2018) to number 13 as per MAT (March 2019). This growth has been primarily on account of improvement in the base business

performance led by increase in volumes and price in certain products.

- During the year, we launched 15 brands in India, including Hervycta (the fifth biosimilar from our internal pipeline), which aided growth. Eight of our brands (Omez, Omez D, Atarax, Econorm, Razo D, Nise, Stamlo, Razo) are in top 300 brands of the IPM.

<!-- image -->

- In FY2020, we will continue to drive productivity improvement and focus on our core therapeutic areas and big brands. In the mediumto-long-term, we will focus on ramping up of biosimilars through internal and partnered assets and building differentiated products in relevant therapies, accompanied by a further increase of the base business.

## PSAI

The PSAI business recorded revenues of ' 24.1 billion in FY2019 , representing a 10% growth over the previous year. In FY2019, we fi led 82 DMFs globally, of which nine were in the US.

- During FY2019, we launched our advanced B2B Customer Service Portal called 'XCEED', which is expected to increase the operational effi ciency

- of our partners by enabling them to transact online and access real time information about their business and products with us.
- Our strategy of building a sustainable and growing business involves new product launches and ramping up of base businesses in key geographies. We will also leverage our relationship with key customers by supplying materials that have value addition over being 'plain-vanilla' APIs. We aim to be a partner of choice for global generics manufacturers and achieve global leadership through costs and service.

neuro franchise, i.e. ZEMBRACE® picked up through the year along anticipated lines.

- During the year we received th e fi n al approval from the USFDA for our migraine candidate DFN-02 (Sumatriptan intranasal spray). DFN-02 is a novel intranasal formulation for the treatment of acute migraine with or without aura.
- On the R&D front, our focus continues to be on advancing the development of the two in-licensed assets - E7777 and PPC-06 - in addition to the in-house pipeline in a well calibrated manner which strives to achieve an optimal balance between risks and costs.
- Through the year we continued our efforts to selectively divest products. In late September 2018, the rights to Cloderm® Cream, 0.1% and its authorized generic were divested to EPI Health for an upfront

consideration followed by future royalties. Towards the end of th e fi n ancial year, we divested our derma commercial portfolio comprising SERNIVO® Spray, 0.05%, PROMISEB® Topical Cream and TRIANEX® 0.05% to Encore Dermatology for an upfront consideration followed by future milestones.

There is a slight change in philosophy to focus more on addressing 'larger unmet needs' and 'bringing a highly selective and focused innovative approach' through global development versus 'incremental improvement'. This change should enable the PP business to off er a meaningful contribution to the market place. At an overall level, this aligns well with our renewed strategy to enable us to achieve self-sustainability and profi table growth for each of our businesses.

Renewed strategy to enable us to achieve self-sustainability and profitable growth for each of our businesses.

## USFDA OBSERVATIONS: AN UPDATE

It may be recalled that the USFDA had issued a warning letter dated 5 November 2015 relating to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) deviations at our API manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as at our oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.

The contents of the Warning Letter emanated from Form 483 observations that followed inspections of these three sites by the USFDA in November 2014, January 2015 and February-March 2015, respectively.

Pending resolution of the issues identifi ed in the Warning Letter, the USFDA withheld approval of new products from these facilities.

After issuance of the Warning Letter, we promptly instituted corrective and preventive actions and submitted a comprehensive response to the USFDA, followed by periodic written updates and in-person meetings. Moreover, to minimize the business impact, we transferred certain key products to alternate manufacturing facilities.

The USFDA subsequently re-inspected these facilities between February and April 2017. The outcomes of these inspections were as follows:

- API facility at Miryalaguda : The USFDA raised three observations in the areas of older methods of validation, improvements in instrument calibrations and adherence to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) test methods.

- API facility at Srikakulam : The USFDA raised two observations in the areas of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) maintenance, and the management of soft copies of chromatograms.
- Oncology formulation facility at Duvvada : The USFDA raised 13 observations in the areas of investigations, batch production records, document controls, general computer systems and environmental monitoring.

Global corrective actions, as well as some specifi c actions, were further implemented. In addition, a detailed response was submitted to the USFDA which included root cause, corrective actions and preventive actions and impact assessment.

The current status for these sites is as follows:

- API facility at Miryalaguda : In June 2017, the USFDA issued an Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) indicating successful closure of the audit of this facility. In January 2019, USFDA has inspected API facility at Miryalaguda and one observation was noted. We have responded to the observation. In May 2019, we have received an Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) from USFDA indicating successful closure of the audit of this facility.
- API facility at Srikakulam : In February 2018, the USFDA issued an EIR for this facility indicating that its inspection status remains unchanged and we were asked to carry out certain detailed investigations and analyses. In response, we submitted the results of such investigations in October 2018. As part of the review of the response by the USFDA, certain additional follow on queries were received by us. We responded to all queries in January 2019, to the USFDA. In February 2019, USFDA requested answers to three follow-up questions to us and we responded in March 2019. Based on the subsequent discussion with USFDA, a reinspection will be conducted for the site.
- Oncology formulation facility at Duvvada : In June 2018, we requested the USFDA to schedule a reinspection of the oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada. In October 2018, the reinspection was

completed and the USFDA issued Form 483 with eight observations. We responded to these observations on 20 November 2018. Subsequently, in February 2019, the USFDA issued an EIR indicating successful closure of audit of this facility.

Thus, there have been satisfactory audit closures in two of the three facilities. At present, we await the reinspection of our API facility at Srikakulam.

We remain fully committed to following high standards of the quality and striving towards further strengthening of our quality management systems and processes. Our plans to enhance quality management systems and operations include improvements in rigor of investigations and document control systems, standardization of instrument calibrations, strengthening controls with respect to information technology as well as shop fl oor training programs, and simplifying and standardizing standard operating procedures and batch records at the shop fl oor.

We have initiated additional operational improvements such as shop fl oor supervision and process walks, engineering, implementation of electronic batch records to eliminate manual errors, and focus on robustness of processes. We are fully committed to produce safe and effi cacious products for our patients.

We remain fully committed to following high standards of the quality and striving towards further strengthening of our quality management systems and processes.

## REVENUE

The total revenue grew by 8% to ' 153,851 million in FY2019. The growth was primarily aided by increase in volume and new product launches across our businesses and benefi ts due to depreciation of rupee against the US dollar, partially off set by price erosion in our GG segment's North America (the US and Canada) and the Europe businesses.

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profi t increased by 9.3% to ' 83,430 million in FY2019. This resulted in a gross profi t margin of 54.2% in FY2019 representing an increase of 50 basis points compared to FY2018. The gross profi t margin for GG was 58.5%. The GG gross profi t margin was largely impacted by price erosion in the US, which was partly off set by benefi t from new product launches with higher margins, cost optimization initiatives taken by us, and the benefi t from depreciation of rupee against the US dollar. For the PSAI business, the gross profi t margin was 25.4%. PSAI's gross profi t margin rose on account of an increase in sales of products with higher margins and from depreciation of the rupee against the US dollar.

## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)

SG&A expenses increased by 4% to ' 48,890 million in FY2019. This was largely attributable to increase in personnel costs, primarily on account of annual increments, freight outward costs due to increase in volumes, and increases pertaining to depreciation of rupee. The increase was offset by signifi cant efforts and continued focus on cost optimization. SG&A accounted for 31.8% of revenue in FY2019 versus 33% in FY2018 - or an improvement of 120 basis points over the previous year.

## R&D EXPENSES

R&D expenses for FY2019 were ' 15,607 million, or 10.1% of revenue, versus 12.9% in FY2018. The absolute and proportional decrease in R&D spends were in line with the productivity improvement measures undertaken by us including cost optimization, productivity gains and prioritization of projects, which have been executed in a manner that does not impinge on building the pipeline of complex generics, biosimilars and diff erentiated products.

The net fi nance income was ' 1,117 million in FY2019 versus ' 2,080 million in FY2018. The reduction is primarily on account of higher realized gains on redemption of mutual funds in FY2018.

## INCOME TAX

For FY2019, income tax expense was ' 3,648 million, with an effective tax rate of 16.3%. This tax outgo was 19.6% lower than FY2018 ( ' 4,535 million and an effective tax rate of 31.6%). The FY2018 rate was higher due to a one-time charge taken during transition to a new tax regime in the US (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). Adjusted for it, the eff ective tax rate for FY2018 was 22.5%. In FY2019, the effective tax rate was lower due to allowance of a claim of deduction of an item which was previously disallowed for tax purpose.

## NET PROFIT

Net profi t increased by 92% to ' 18,795 million in FY2019. This represents a PAT margin of 12.2% of revenues versus 6.9% in FY2018.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The data are given in Tables 3 and 4 . Cash generated from operating activities in FY2019 was ' 28,704 million.

We began FY2019 by focusing on redesigning and optimizing our organization structure at senior levels resulting in higher synergy, agility and effi ciency in teams.

Investing activities net outfl ow amounting to ' 7,727 million in FY2019 includes net investment in property, plant, equipment and intangibles to build capacity and capabilities for future business growth. Cash outfl ow from fi nancing activities was ' 21,326 million. Closing cash and cash equivalents as on 31 March 2019 was ' 2,228 million.

## DEBT-EQUITY

In FY2019, short-term and long-term borrowings, including the current and non-current portion, decreased by ' 12,333 million. As on 31 March 2019 our debt to equity ratio is 0.27 as against 31 March 2018 of 0.40. The net debt to equity position was at 0.09 versus 0.24 last year. Table 5 gives the data.

## ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

Our ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- Proactively identify and highlight risks to relevant stakeholders;
- Facilitate discussions around risk prioritization and mitigation;
- Provide a framework to assess risk capacity and appetite;
- Develop systems to warn when the appetite is being breached; and
- Provide an analysis of residual risk.

The ERM team connects with our business units and functions, which are the primary sources for risk identifi cation. It also monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers in the industry.

Our ERM function focuses on identifi cation of key business, and operational and strategic risks. These are carried out through structured interviews, on-call discussions, or review of incidents.

The team collaborates with the compliance, internal audit and other assurance teams to identify and mitigate risks of business units, including risk relating to cyber security.

Risks are aggregated at the unit, function and organization levels and are categorized by risk groups. Our response framework categorizes these risks into (i) preventable, (ii) strategic and (iii) external risk s. Thefi nance , investment and risk management (FIRM) council is a management level committee that helps the ERM function to prioritize organization-wide risks and steer mitigation efforts in line with our risk capacity and appetite.

Mitigation work carried out by the ERM team is periodically reviewed, and the progress on key risks is discussed with the FIRM council, our senior management, as well as at the risk management committee of the board of directors. These include (i) updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks and (ii) specifi c risk-related initiatives carried out during the year.

During FY2019, risk mitigation eff orts were focused towards patent infringement risk, quality and regulatory risk, geo-political risk, cyber security risk, assessing and strengthening data privacy related posture, and reviews of other operating and compliance risks.

## HUMAN RESOURCES (HR)

In the previous year, we embarked on an organization transformation journey taking up several new initiatives directed towards execution excellence and growth. This involved bringing in best in class talent in key roles, defi ning cross functional processes and building the right culture for the growth ahead. As on 31 March 2019, we had 21,966 employees.

We began FY2019 by focusing on redesigning and optimizing our organization structure at senior levels resulting in higher synergy, agility and effi ciency in teams. At the same time, we successfully implemented comprehensive intervention in one of our manufacturing units to ensure higher regulatory readiness. This involved building competence in our teams, simplifying work processes and enhancing our quality processes. It is now being extended across all our manufacturing plants.

<!-- image -->

We continue to focus on strengthening our talent processes through cadre and capability building interventions.

In line with creating a high-performance culture, we revamped our performance management process. For senior leaders in the organization, the new system expands the scope of evaluation to include assessment of necessary leadership behaviors based on a 360° feedback. It promotes higher transparency and ownership of shared outcomes. In addition to this, for our manufacturing and quality control frontline employees, the performance process also helps reward team outcomes.

Signifi cant efforts were made to strengthen our leadership and hire benchmark talent. These have helped in bringing in a fresh perspective and renewed energy to the organization. In our commercial businesses of Russia, North America and India, we have strengthened our local leadership presence through these eff orts.

We continue to focus on strengthening our talent processes through cadre and capability building interventions. We have completed one year of the Young Leaders Development Program which has already started creating impact. We are now replicating the same model to create cadres in sales and manufacturing.

Diversity and inclusion remain important on the organizational agenda. For the second time, we have been featured in the 2019 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for our commitment to gender equality. We have also been strengthening our eff orts towards actively promoting employment for specially-abled individuals. Dr. Reddy's Foundation was recognized by The National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP)-Mindtree Helen Keller National Disability Award.

## OUTLOOK

Despite challenges that are innate to the industry in which we are in, FY2019 has been a satisfactory year in terms of improvement of performance in various domains.

The challenging pricing environment in the US continued in FY2019 which led to signifi cant price erosion; and further delay in some of the key new launches in this market impacted the performance. However, the strong performance by branded markets and the PSAI business have helped to close the year on a satisfactory note.

We were able to address the USFDA concerns on the formulation facility in Duvvada as well as our API facility at Miryalaguda and have been working towards a favorable resolution for our API plant in Srikakulam - which should provide necessary impetus for the ne xt fi nancial year .

During FY2019, we made signifi cant inroads towards a leaner business model and, thus, leveraged higher productivity and effi ciencies across several functions. The momentum is expected to continue with increased rigor in FY2020.

We shall attempt to further strengthen our presence in our six chosen spaces (United States, India, Russia, China, Global Hospitals including Biosimilars, and the Global API business) to drive next level of growth for us. Our target is to attain self-sustainability for each of our business.

Despite multiple headwinds being faced by the overall industry, we are cautiously optimistic of improving our performance in FY2020 by calibrating our levers which would suit the business environment better and, thus, guide us to better performance for the year ahead.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ('Dr. Reddy's' or 'the company') believes that timely disclosures, transparent accounting policies coupled with a strong and independent board go a long way in maintaining good corporate governance, preserving shareholders' trust and maximizing long-term corporate value. The company's corporate governance framework is based on the following main principles:

- Appropriate composition and size of the board, with each director bringing in key expertise in diff erent areas.
- Proactive fl ow of accurate information to members of the board and board committees to enable eff ective discharge of fi duciary duties.
- Ethical business conduct by the board, management and employees.
- Well-developed systems of internal controls, risk management and fi nancial reporting.
- Protection and facilitation of shareholders' rights.
- Adequate, timely and accurate disclosure of all material operational and fi nancial information to stak eholders.

In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates corporate governance for listed companies through SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations). We are in full compliance with all the applicable provisions of SEBI's corporate governance norms. We are also in compliance with the appropriate corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange Inc. (NYSE).

This Chapter, together with the information given in the Chapters on Management Discussion and Analysis and Additional Shareholders' Information, constitute our report on Corporate Governance for 2018-19 (or FY2019).

## BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPOSITION

As on 31 March 2019, our board had 12 directors, comprising (i) two executive directors, including the chairman of the board, and (ii) 10 independent directors as defi ned under the Companies Act, 2013, the Listing Regulations and the Corporate

Governance Guidelines of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Their detailed profi les are given in this annual report.

The directors have expertise in the fi elds of strategy, management and governance, fi nance, operations, science, technology, human resource development and economics, as under.

Mr. K Satish Reddy and Mr. G V Prasad (whole time promoter directors); Dr. Bruce L A Carter and Mr. Allan Oberman (science, technology, operations and industry experts); Mr. Sridar Iyengar, Mr. Bharat N Doshi and Dr. Omkar Goswami (economics and fi nancial experts); Mr. Anupam Puri, Mr. Prasad R Menon and Mr. Leo Puri (strategy, human resources, management and governance); and Ms. Kalpana Morparia and Ms. Shikha Sharma (CEO experience in large Indian public companies). Such expertise enables the board to steer the company in the right direction.

The board provides leadership, strategic guidance, objective and independent views to the company's management while discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, thereby ensuring that the management adheres to high standards of ethics, transparency and disclosure. It regularly reviews the company's governance, risk and compliance framework, business plans, and organization structure to align with the highest global standards.

Each director informs the company on an annual basis about the board and board committee positions she/he occupies in other companies, and notifi es it of any changes regarding their directorships and committee positions. In addition, the independent directors provide an annual confi rmation that they meet the criteria of independence as defi ned under Indian laws. The board after assessment of such disclosures, declarations and confi rmations, opines that all the independent directors fulfi l the conditions specifi ed under Listing Regulations and are independent of the management.

Table 1 gives the composition of our board, with all relevant details.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

The board, on recommendations of the nomination, governance and compensation committee (NGCC), considers the appointment and reappointment of directors.

Section 149(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, provides that an independent director shall hold offi ce up to fi ve consecutive years on the board of a company and shall be eligible for reappointment on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders. Moreover, independent directors cannot retire by rotation. Accordingly, all our independent directors were appointed as such for terms ranging from one to fi ve years at the 30th annual general meeting (AGM) of the company.

The terms of Mr. Sridar Iyengar (DIN: 00278512) and Ms. Kalpana Morparia (DIN: 00046081) independent directors, end at the forthcoming 35th AGM. Considering their performance evaluation reports, the board has recommended the reappointment of Mr. Iyengar and Ms. Morparia, as independent directors under Section 149 of Companies Act, 2013 for a second term of four and fi ve years, respectively.

Further, Mr. Sridar Iyengar (aged 71 years) and Ms. Kalpana Morparia (aged 70 years) will attain the age of seventy fi ve years during their second term of four and fi ve years respectively. Hence in terms of Regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations approval of shareholders is also sought for continuation of Mr. Iyengar and Ms. Morparia's directorship even after attaining such age.

During FY2019, the shareholders of the company approved reappointment of Mr. Anupam Puri (DIN: 00209113) and Dr. Bruce L A Carter (DIN: 02331779), independent directors, for a second term of one and three year(s) respectively, under Section 149(10) of the Companies Act, 2013.

Section 152 of the Companies Act, 2013, states that one-third of the board members other than independent directors who are subject to retire by rotation, shall do so every year and be

eligible for reappointment, if approved by the shareholders. Mr. G V Prasad, (DIN:00057433) retires by rotation at the forthcoming AGM and, being eligible, seeks reappointment.

Additionally, Mr. Leo Puri (DIN: 01764813), Ms. Shikha Sharma (DIN: 00043265) and Mr. Allan Oberman (DIN: 08393837) were appointed as additional directors of the company, categorized as independent with effect from 25 October 2018, 31 January 2019 and 26 March 2019 respectively. Therefore, at the forthcoming AGM, approval of shareholders is being sought for:

- i. Reappointment of Mr. G V Prasad, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for the reappointment.
- ii. Reappointment of Mr. Sridar Iyengar as an independent director for a second term of four years and continuation of directorship even after attaining 75 years of age.
- iii. Reappointment of Ms. Kalpana Morparia as an independent director for a second
- term of fi ve years and continuation of directorship even after attaining 75 years of age.
- iv. Appointment of Mr. Leo Puri as an independent director for a term of fi ve years with effect from 25 October 2018.
- v. Appointment of Ms. Shikha Sharma as an independent director for a term of fi ve years with eff ect from 31 January 2019.
- vi. Appointment of Mr. Allan Oberman as an independent director for a term of fi ve years with effect from 26 March 2019.

Mr. Hans Peter Hasler resigned from the board on 14 June 2018 as an independent director. Having served as an independent director on the company's board since June 2016, Mr. Hasler decided to actively engage in a business opportunity which could pose a potential confl ict of interest vis-à-vis his position as a director of the company. In order to avoid this, he tendered his resignation. The board noted Mr. Hasler's resignation at its meeting held on 26 July 2018.

Mr. Anupam Puri completes his second term as an independent director. Dr. Omkar Goswami retires from the board of the company as independent director and does not seek reappointment. The board wishes them well, and places on record its appreciation for their work over the long period of time that they have served as directors of the company.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the board is the responsibility of the NGCC of the board, which consists entirely of independent directors. Given the existing composition of the board, the tenure as well as the years left of the existing members to serve on the board, and the need for new domain expertise are reviewed by this committee. When such a need becomes apparent, the committee reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings in India. It then places the details of shortlisted candidates to

the board for its consideration. If the board approves, the person is appointed as an additional director, subject to the approval of shareholders at the company's next general meeting.

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new independent director with the company, an information kit, inter alia , containing documents about the company, such as its annual reports, sustainability reports, investor presentations, recent press releases, research reports, code of business conduct and ethics (COBE), memorandum and articles of association and a brief on company's board practices is provided. The new independent director individually meets with board members and senior management. Visits to plants are organized for the director to understand the company's operations.

We believe that the board should be continuously empowered with knowledge of latest developments affecting the company and the industry. Apart from regular presentations on the company's business strategies and associated risks, expositions are made on various topics covering the pharmaceutical industry. Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial pronouncements around industry-related laws are regularly circulated to the directors. They also visit the company's manufacturing and research locations. Each director has complete and unfettered access to any of the company's information and full freedom to interact with senior management.

Details of the familiarization programs for independent directors are available on the company's website www.drreddys.com/media/904446/ familiarization-programs-2019.pdf

## LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Upon their appointment, independent directors are given a formal appointment letter containing, inter alia, the term of appointment, roles, function, duties and responsibilities, the company's code of conduct, disclosures and confi dentiality. For such terms and conditions, see: www.drreddys.com/investor/governance/ policies-and-documents/terms-condition -directors.html

## BOARD EVALUATION

Since FY2015, the board carried out an annual self-evaluation of its performance,

the working of its committees and peer evaluation of each director internally. Prior to that, on two such occasions, an independent expert was engaged to conduct the evaluation process.

During the year, the NGCC discussed and decided to again engage an independent expert to perform the evaluation and effectiveness process of the board, its committees and individual directors for FY2019.

For the purpose of this annual evaluation, each director completes a questionnaire that involves peer evaluation and feedback on processes of the board and its committees. The independent expert also meets the directors separately. The contribution and impact of individual members are evaluated on a number of parameters such as level of engagement, independence of judgment, conflicts resolution, contributions to enhance the board's overall effectiveness, etc. Peer ratings on certain parameters, positive attributes and improvement areas for each director are provided to them on a confi dential basis.

The committees are evaluated on various parameters such as effective discharge of their roles, responsibilities and advice given to the board for discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, including adequate and periodical updates to the board on the committees' functioning.

## DIRECTORS' SHAREHOLDING IN THE COMPANY

Table 2 gives details of shares/ADRs held by the directors as on 31 March 2019.

## MEETINGS OF THE BOARD

The company plans and prepares the schedule of the board and board committee meetings eighteen to twenty four months in advance. The schedule of meetings and their agenda are finalized in consultation with the chairman of the board, the lead independent director and committee chairpersons. Agendas are circulated in advance with appropriate presentations, detailed notes, supporting documents and executive summaries.

Under Indian laws, the board of directors must meet at least four times a year, with a maximum gap of 120 days between two board meetings. Our board met five times during the financial year under review on: 22 May 2018, 26 July 2018, 26 October 2018, 1 February 2019 and 26 March 2019. Details of directors' attendance at board meetings and the AGM are given in Table 3 .

## OTHER BOARD MATTERS

## CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (CAPEX)

The board approves the annual capex budget in line with the company's long-term strategy. An internal management committee approves all capex investments within the annual capex budget approved by the board. An update on key capex approvals (and their relevant details) granted by the internal management committee is generally provided to the board.

## COMPLIANCE REVIEWS

We have a full-fl edged team and an identifi ed chief compliance offi cer (CCO) to oversee compliance activities. The company's compliance status is periodically updated to the senior management team including the CEO, COO and CFO, and presentations are given in the quarterly audit committee and risk management committee meetings. When pertinent, these are also shared with all board members.

## COBE AND VIGIL MECHANISM

We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics ('COBE' or the 'code'), which applies to all directors and employees, subsidiaries and affi liates. It is the responsibility of all directors and employees to familiarize themselves with this code and comply with its standards. The board and the employees across the globe annually affi rm compliance with the code. A declaration of the co-chairman, managing director and CEO of the company to this effect is enclosed as Exhibit 7 to this Chapter.

The company has an ombudsperson policy (whistle-blower or vigil mechanism) to report concerns on actual or suspected violations of the code. The audit committee chairperson is the chief ombudsperson. Complaints and reports submitted to the company and their resolution are reported through the chief ombudsperson to the audit committee and, where applicable, to the board. During FY2019, no personnel has been denied access to the audit committee on ombudsperson issues.

The COBE and ombudsperson policy are available on the company's website: www. drreddys.com/investors/governance/ code-of-business-conduct-and-ethics-cobe and www.drreddys.com/investors/ governance/ombudsperson-policy

## RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We have adequate procedures to identify and monitor related party transactions. All transactions entered into with related parties during the fi nancial year were in the ordinary course of business and on arm's length pricing basis. All related party transactions are placed before the audit committee and the board for review and approval, as appropriate. The details of related party transactions are discussed in detail in note 2.22 to the standalone fi nancial statements. The company' s policy on materiality of the related party transactions is available on the company's website: https://www.drreddys.com/ media/764069/policy-materiality-relatedparty-transactions.pdf

The interested directors are not present for discussion and voting on such related party transactions. Furthermore, the transactions with directors/their relatives/entities outside our group, in which they are interested, are reviewed by an independent chartered accountant.

## SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

The audit committee reviews the fi nancial statements of our subsidiaries. It also reviews the investments made by such subsidiaries, the statement of all signifi cant transactions and arrangements entered into by subsidiaries, and the compliances of each materially signifi cant subsidiary on a periodic basis. The minutes of board meetings of the subsidiary companies are placed before our board for review. The company's policy for determining material subsidiaries is available on the company's website: https://www.drreddys.com/media/ 763674/policy-for-determining-materialsubsidiaries.pdf

## DISCLOSURE ON ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

In the preparation of fi nancial statements for FY2019, there is no treatment of any transaction which is diff erent from that prescribed in the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notifi ed by the Government of India under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule 7

of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended by the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) (Amendment) Rules, 2016, the guidelines issued by SEBI and other accounting principles generally accepted in India.

## MANAGEMENT

Our management develops and implements policies, procedures and practices that attempt to translate the company's core purpose and mission into reality. It also identifi es, measures, monitors and minimizes risks in the business and ensures safe, sound and effi cient operations. These are internally supervised and monitored through the company's management council (MC).

## MANAGEMENT COUNCIL (MC)

Our MC consists of senior management from the business and corporate functions. Page nos. 20-21 of this annual report gives details of the members of the MC. Apart from monthly meetings, the MC meets once a quarter for two-day sessions. Background notes for the monthly and quarterly meetings are circulated in advance. Listed below are some of the key issues that were considered by the MC during the year under review:

- The company's long-term strategy, growth initiatives and priorities;
- Overall company performance, including those of various business units;
- Decision on major corporate policies;
- Discussion and sign-off on annual plans, budgets, investments and other major initiatives; and
- Discussion on business alliances proposals and organizational design.

## MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Chapter on Management Discussion and Analysis forms a part of this annual report.

## MANAGEMENT DISCLOSURES

Senior management of the company (at the level of senior director and above, as well as certain identifi ed key employees) make annual disclosures to the board on all material, fi nancial and commercial transactions in which they may have personal interest, if any, and which may have a potential confl ict with the interest of the company. Transactions with key

managerial personnel are listed in the fi nancial section of this annual report under related party transactions.

## PROHIBITION OF INSIDER TRADING

We have a policy prohibiting insider trading in conformity with applicable Regulations of the SEBI in India and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the USA. Necessary procedures have been laid down for directors, officers, and designated persons for trading in the securities of the company. These are periodically communicated to such employees who are considered as insiders of the company. Apart from this, regular insider trading awareness sessions are conducted for the benefit of designated persons. Trading window closure/blackouts/quiet periods, when the directors and designated persons are not permitted to trade in the securities of the company, are intimated in advance to all concerned. Violations of the policy, if any, are appropriately acted on and reported to SEBI.

## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND STATUTORY AUDITS

We have both external and internal audit systems in place. Auditors have access to all records and information of the company. The board recognizes the work of the auditors as an independent check on the information received from the management on the operations and performance of the company. The board periodically reviews the fi ndings and recommendations of the statutory and internal auditors and suggests corrective actions, whenever necessary.

## INTERNAL CONTROLS

We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:

- Effectiveness and effi ciency of operations;
- Adequacy of safeguards for assets;
- Reliability of fi nancial and non-fi nancial reporting; and
- Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The integrity and reliability of the internal control systems are achieved through clear policies and procedures, process automation, careful selection, training and development of employees and an organization structure that segregates

responsibilities. Our internal audit is an independent, objective assurance and advisory function, responsible for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. The internal audit team helps to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice, and insight. The internal audit team prepares annual audit plans based on risk assessment and conducts extensive reviews covering fi nancial, operational and compliance controls. Areas requiring specialized knowledge are reviewed in partnership with external experts or by recruiting resources with specialized skills. Suggested improvement in processes are identifi ed during reviews and communicated to the management on an on going basis.

The audit committee of the board monitors the performance of internal audit team on a periodic basis through review of audit plans, audit fi ndings and speed of issue resolution through follow-ups. Each year, there are at least four meetings in which the audit committee reviews internal audit fi ndings. During the year, the audit committee chairman also met the CIA without the presence of management.

## CEO AND CFO CERTIFICATION

A certifi cate of the co-chairman, managing director and CEO as well as the CFO of the company on fi nancial statements and applicable internal controls as stipulated under Regulation 17(8) of the Listing Regulations is enclosed as Exhibit 8 to this Chapter.

## SHARE TRANSFER SYSTEM

All queries and requests relating to share transfers/transmissions may be addressed to our RTA.

To expedite the process of share transfers, the company secretary has been delegated with the power to attend to the share transfer formalities at regular intervals.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 46 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Rule

6(2)(a) of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, duplicate share certifi cates, in lieu of those that are lost or destroyed, should only be issued with the prior consent of the board. However, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs vide its general circular no. 19/2014, dated 12 June 2014, has clarifi ed that the powers of the board with regard to the issue of duplicate share certifi cates can be exercised by a committee of directors. Therefore, the board of directors, at its meeting held on

12 May 2015, delegated the power to issue duplicate share certifi cates, to the stakeholders' relationship committee.

The stakeholders' relationship committee attends to such requests at regular intervals.

We periodically review the operations of our RTA. The number of shares transferred/transmitted in physical form during the last two fi nancial years are given in Table 6.

## UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS/ INTEREST

Pursuant to Section 125 of the Companies Act, 2013, unclaimed dividend amounts for the FY2011 of ' 7,030,361/- and debenture interest for the FY2012 ' 1,729,247/- has been transferred to the general revenue account of the Central Government/Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF).

The dividends for the FY2012 and interest on debentures for the FY2013 which are unclaimed for seven years will be transferred to IEPF established by the Central Government under Section 125 of the Companies Act, 2013. Table 10 gives the transfer dates in this regard.

Bonus debentures, issued by the company in the year 2011, matured on 24 March 2014. These were redeemed for cash at face value of ' 5/- each along with third and final year's interest.

Shareholders/debenture holders who have not claimed the dividend(s)/interest/ redemption amount are, therefore, requested to do so before they are statutorily transferred to the IEPF.

The shareholders/debenture holders who have not cashed their dividend/interest warrants nor claimed the redemption amount on matured debentures are requested to immediately approach Bigshare Services Private Limited, for making payment through electronic bank transfer. In cases, where bank details for making electronic payment are not available, or electronic payment instructions have failed, or rejected by the bank, duplicate warrant(s)/demand draft(s) may be issued in lieu of the original warrant(s)/demand draft(s).

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone Ind AS financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the Balance sheet as at 31 March 2019, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of signifi cant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2019, its profi t including other comprehensive income, its cash fl ows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specifi ed under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone Ind A S fi nancial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfi lled the responsibilities described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Carrying value of intangible assets, intangible assets under development and goodwill (as described in note 1.3(f) and 1.3(i) of the signifi cant accounting policies, and note 2.3 and 2.2 for details and movement in goodwill and intangible assets respectively in the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements)

As at 31 March 2019, the Company has ' 7,000 million of intangible assets and ' 323 million of goodwill. The carrying value of these intangible assets are based on future cash flows and there is a risk that the assets maybe impaired if cash fl ows are not in line with projections.

Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to management's assessment of recoverable amount, being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell, involving significant judgment and are based on number of variables and estimates including projection of future sales, operating costs and profit margins; appropriate discount rate and terminal value growth rate; and probability of technical and regulatory success factors in applying discounted cash fl ow valuation methodology.

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We assessed the Company's methodology applied in determining the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We assessed the Company's valuation methodology applied in deriving the recoverable value.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the assumptions applied to key inputs such as discount rates, sales volume and prices, long term growth rates and terminal values, which included comparing these inputs with assumptions made by the management in prior years.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to previous year / actual performance with management to evaluate whether the inputs and assumptions used in the cash fl ow forecasts were suitable.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We also assessed the recoverable value headroom by performing sensitivity testing of key assumptions used.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the adequacy of financial statement disclosures, including disclosures of key assumptions, judgements and sensitivities.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

## Key audit matters

How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(k) of the significant accounting policies, and note 2.30(A) containing details of contingencies in the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at different levels in the Company, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Company's in house legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We have compared the said evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the standalone Ind AS financial statements. We have tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We solicited legal letters from the Company's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate we examined correspondences connected with the cases.

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company, assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case-to-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation. The aforesaid assessment may result in an incorrect disclosure or provision in the books of account.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgemental (due to the diffi culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We obtained the details of tax assessments and demands as at the year ended 31 March 2019. We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities. We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of the tax exposures and assessed management's conclusions on whether exposures are probable, contingent or remote. Where exposures are assessed as probable, we evaluated the amounts provided with respect to those exposures.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We also evaluated the adequacy of disclosures in the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

Rebates, discounts, returns etc. in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(l) of the significant accounting policies of standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements and note 2.11 of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We assessed and performed test of controls over the completeness, recognition and measurement of accruals.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We obtained Management's calculations for accruals and assessed the assumptions used by reference to the company's stated commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We assessed management analysis of the historical pattern of accruals to validate management's assumption for creation of such provisions.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, where relevant and to current payment trends. We also considered the historical accuracy of the management's estimates in prior years. We have also performed procedures to test recording of revenue in appropriate period which includes:

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for sales returns, rebates & discounts, etc. The estimates relating to the accruals are important given the significance of revenue and considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate because change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter. GLYPH<circlesolid>

- o Verifying sample sales transactions near period-end.
- o Evaluating the level of returns following the period end and compared to previous periods.

Recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosures of revenues and other related balances in view of adoption of Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (as described in note 1.3(a) of the signifi cant accounting policies of standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We considered the Company's revenue recognition accounting policies based on the principles in Ind AS 115.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the design, implementation and effective operation of the internal controls relating to implementation of the new revenue accounting standard.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We selected samples of continuing and new contracts and performed the following procedures:
- o Read, analysed and identifi ed the distinct performance obligations in these contracts.
- o Compared these performance obligations with that identified and recorded by the Company.
- o Considered the terms of the contracts to determine the transaction price including any variable consideration to verify the transaction price used to compute revenue.

The Company has adopted Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, starting 1 April 2018. The adoption of the new revenue accounting standard involves application of certain key principles relating to identifi cation of performance obligations, determination of transaction price of the identifi ed performance obligations, the timing of transfer of control for recognition of revenue or the appropriateness of the basis used to measure revenue recognized over a period. Additionally, new revenue accounting standard contains new disclosures.

- o Evaluated management assessment of point of recognition of revenue based on transfer of control or satisfaction of obligations over time.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the adequacy of financial statement disclosures, pursuant to new revenue accounting standard.

## Other Information

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises, Statutory reports, corporate governance and Board's report included in the Annual report, but does not include the standalone Ind AS financial statements and our auditors' report thereon, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditors' report, and Corporate Overview and letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

Our opinion on the standalone Ind AS financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identifi ed above and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone Ind AS financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of Management for the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone Ind AS financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company's fi nancial reporting process.

## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal fi nancial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the standalone Ind AS financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signifi cant audit fi ndings, including any signifi cant defi ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

Standalone

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefi ts of such communication.

## ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE IND AS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company") as of 31 March 2019 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal fi nancial controls based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable fi nancial information, as required under the Act.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind A S fi nancial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated eff ectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material eff ect on the standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS fi nancial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over fi nancial reporting with reference to these standalone Ind AS financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

- GLYPH<circlesolid> assets held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> share-based payments are measured at fair value;

## c) Functional and presentation currency

These fi nancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the Company. All fi nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

## d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signifi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.2 (c) - Assessment of functional currency;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3 (c) - Financial instruments;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3 (d) - Business combinations;

## e) Current and non-current classifi cation

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .

## Assets:

An asset is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classifi ed as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always disclosed as non-current.

## 1.3 Significant accounting policies

## a) New Standards adopted by the Company

## Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In March 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs ("MCA") has notified Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2018. This comprehensive new standard supersedes Ind AS 18, Revenue , Ind AS 11, Construction contracts and related interpretations. The new standard amends revenue recognition requirements and establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

The Company adopted Ind AS 115 effective as of 1 April 2018.The impacts of the adoption of the new standard are summarised below:

## Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sale of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements, each as more particularly described below. Most of such revenue (approximately 98.5%) is generated from the sale of goods.

## Sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods consists of the sale of generic and branded products and the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised where control is transferred to the Company's customers at the time of shipment to or receipt of goods by the customers. There was no change in the point of recognition of revenue upon adoption of Ind AS 115.

Standalone

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Service income

Service income, which primarily relates to revenue from contract research, is recognised as and when the underlying services are performed. There was no change in the point of recognition of revenue upon adoption of Ind AS 115. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements continue to be deferred and are recognised over the expected period that related services are to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfi ed. The adoption of Ind AS 115 did not signifi cantly change the timing or amount of revenue recognised by the Company from these arrangements, nor did it change accounting for these royalty arrangements, as the standard's royalty exception is applied for intellectual property licenses. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements continue to be deferred and are recognised over the expected period that related services are to be performed.

## Profi t share revenues and milestone payments

Revenues from sale of goods also include revenues from profit sharing arrangements with business partners for sales of the Company's products in certain markets. Furthermore, the Company receives milestone payments related to out-licensing of the intellectual property. Under Ind AS 115, the profit share amount is recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of profit share will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the profit share is subsequently resolved. The adoption of Ind AS 115 did not significantly change the timing or amount of revenue recognised by the Company under these arrangements.

The Company applied the modified retrospective method upon adoption of Ind AS 115 on 1 April 2018. This method requires the recognition of the cumulative effect of initially applying Ind AS 115 to retained earnings and not to restate prior years.

Overall, the application of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's revenue streams from the sale of goods, service income, license fees, profi t share revenues and milestone payments, and associated rebates and sales returns provisions.

## b) Foreign currency

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at ex change rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- GLYPH<circlesolid> certain debt instruments classifi ed as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> a fi nancial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is eff ective; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> qualifying cash fl ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are eff ective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## c) Financial instruments

A fi nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

All fi nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain signifi cant fi nancing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any signifi cant fi nancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115.

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI);
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profi t or loss (FVTPL); and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).

Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and
- b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included in other income in the statement of profit and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A 'debt instrument' is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) The asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned while holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch').

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Standalone

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The classifi cation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Upon fi rst-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1 April 2015.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> The rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired; or
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

Impairment of trade receivables and other fi nancial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a 'simplified approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of fi nancial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfi ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/ losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profi t and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as fair value through profi t and loss.

## Loans and borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included as fi nance costs in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an exist ing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially diff erent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modifi cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles Brazilian reals, South African rands ("ZAR"), Romanian new leus ("RON") and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classified to the statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain/ loss on such non-derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash fl ows.

## d) Business combinations

In accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 101, First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards , the Company has elected to apply the accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the OCI and accumulates the same in equity as capital reserve where there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase else the gain is directly recognised in equity as capital reserve. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

## e) Property, plant and equipment

## R ecognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life, whichever is shorter.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                                 | Years    |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                   |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings      | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                      | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and machinery                         | 5 to 10  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi  ce equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                    | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed as such under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## f) Goodwill and other intangible assets

Recognition and measurement

| Goodwill                 | Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of non-controlling  interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of identifi able net assets acquired. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees,  the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment loss  on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying value  of the equity accounted investee.   |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Other intangible assets  | Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have finite useful lives are measured at  cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                  | Years   |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles  | 3 to 15 |
| Customer related intangibles | 2 to 5  |
| Other intangibles            | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the diff erence between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## g) Leases

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under fi nance leases are apportioned between the fi nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding lease liability.

The fi nance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## h) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and finished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## i) Impairment of non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defi ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash infl ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash infl ows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefi t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are al locatedfi rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

## j) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefi ts are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefi t obligation.

Standalone

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defi ned benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit and loss in employee benefit expense, refl ects the increase in the defi ned benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognized in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defi ned benefi t plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefi ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefi ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an off er encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, in the statement of profi t and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## k) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the statement of profit and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outfl ow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made .

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefi ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## l) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods.

Accounting policies relating to revenue for the periods after 31 March 2018 are as follows:

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates. Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

| Particulars                                                            | Point of recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales of generic products in India                                     | Upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company.  Control over the generic products is transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to  distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. |
| Sales of active pharmaceutical  ingredients and intermediates in India | Upon delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories  of the Company.                                                                                                                               |
| Export sales and other sales outside  of India                         | Upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide  for specific revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised  once all such activities are completed.    |

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Standalone

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signifi cant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example , the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue . A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition upon the expiration of limited competition or exclusivity periods. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability the Company also recognises an asset (i.e., right to the returned goods), which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Accounting policies relating to revenue for period ending on or prior to 31 March 2018 are as follows: Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods includes relevant taxes and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

Revenue from sales of generic products in India is recognised upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company. Significant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of generic products are transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. Clearing and forwarding agents are generally compensated on a commission basis as a percentage of sales made by them. Revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in India is recognised on delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories of the Company.

Revenue from export sales and other sales outside of India is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred to the customers. Such transfer occurs upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for specific revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised once all such activities are completed.

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profi t share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profit share is available. Otherwise, recognition is deferred to a subsequent period pending satisfaction of such collectability and measurability requirements. In measuring the amount of profit share revenue to be recognised for each period, the Company uses all available information and evidence, including any confirmations from the business partner of the profi t share amount owed to the Company, to the extent made available before the date the Company's Board of Directors authorises the issuance of its fi nancial statements for the applicable period.

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive , or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition upon the expiration of limited competition or exclusivity periods. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrently with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## Export entitlements

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of material consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signifi cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## License fee

The Company from time to time enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. R evenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling and other expenses.

## m) Other income and fi nance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash fl ows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities in the statement of cash fl ows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash fl ow hedges.

## n) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary diff erences:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profi t;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that the future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

## o) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## p) Government grants

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## q) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any diff erence between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## r) Recent accounting pronouncements

Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted by the Company

Ind AS 116, Leases

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) notifi ed Ind AS 116, Leases as part of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases with eff ect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

Standalone

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Upon adoption, a portion of the annual operating lease expense will be recognised as finance expense. Further, a portion of the annual lease payments recognised in the statement of cash flows as reduction of lease liability will be recognised as outfl ow from fi nancing activities, which are currently fully recognised as an outfl ow from operating activities.

The undiscounted and non-cancellable operating lease commitments are ' 232 and ' 276 as at 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, respectively, as disclosed in note 2.26 provide an indicator of the impact of the implementation of Ind AS 116 on the fi nancial statements of the company. Accordingly, the Company believes that the adoption of Ind AS 116 will not have a material impact on it' s fi nancial statements.

## Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, to Ind AS 12, Income Taxes

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) made certain amendments to Ind AS 12, Income taxes by including Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments . This appendix clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of Ind AS 12 are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.

Appendix C explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the applicable tax authority. For example, a decision to claim a deduction for a specifi c expense or not to include a specific item of income in a tax return is an uncertain tax treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under applicable tax law. The amendment provides specific guidance in several areas where previously Ind AS 12 was silent. Appendix C applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable profit or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.

The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019. An entity can, on initial application, elect to apply this amendment either:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> retrospectively applying Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors , if possible without the use of hindsight; or
- GLYPH<circlesolid> retrospectively, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the interpretation recognised at the date of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate).

The Company believes that the adoption of amendments to Ind AS 12 in the form of Appendix C will not have a material impact o n its fi nancial statements.

## s) Rounding of amounts

All amounts in Indian Rupees disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefi ts.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and int erest cashfl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bo nds).

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## 2.1 Property, plant and equipment (continued)

- (1) During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Company sold one of its API manufacturing business units located in Jeedimetla, Hyderabad to Therapiva Private Limited. This sale was done by way of slump sale (as defined under section 2(42C) of Indian Income Tax Act,1961) including all related property, plant and equipment, current assets, current liabilities, and transfer of employees. An amount of ' 423 representing the profit on sale of such business unit was included under the heading "other income".

As of 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, the Company was committed to spend ' 2,423 and ' 3,477, respectively, under agreements to purchase property, plant and equipment. This amount is net of capital advances paid in respect of such purchase commitments.

During the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, the Company capitalised interest cost of ' 74 and ' 71, respectively, with respect to qualifying assets. The rate for capitalisation of interest cost for the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018 was approximately 3.21% and 2.76% respectively.

Depreciation for the year includes an amount of ' 634 (31 March 2018: ' 640) pertaining to assets used for research and development. During the year, the Company incurred ' 677 (31 March 2018: ' 419) towards capital expenditure for research and development. (Refer note 2.35)

## 2.2 Goodwill

Goodwill arising upon business combinations is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Particulars                          |   As at 31 March 2019 |   As at 31 March 2018 |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value-in-use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash fl ows for fi ve years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used range from 6.97% to 13.74% for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rates range from 7.56% to 16.63%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of DRL (the "Committee") administer the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split eff ected in the form of stock dividend issued by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

| Particulars                                                       | Number of options  reserved under  category A   | Number of options  reserved under  category B   | Total     |

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the Company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and five years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted during the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018 were as follows:

In assessing whether the deferred tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefits of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

The changes in fair value of such interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of fi nance cost.

As at 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements.

## 2.29 Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in United States dollars, Russian roubles, U.K pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may con tinue to fl uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

## 2.29 Financial risk management (continued)

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.28 above.

In respect of the Company's forward contracts and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> a ' 1,884/(1,363) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 2,256/(2,256) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2019;

For the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 1,854 and ' 939, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, the Company had ' 10,650 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR plus 25 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps and ' 22,811 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR minus 30 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profiles, refer to note 2.8A and 2.8B of these fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 27 and ' 42, respectively.

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings, interest component of which designated in a cash flow hedge was ' Nil as of 31 March 2019.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e, certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## 2.29 Financial risk management (continued)

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2019, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

## b) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signifi cant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

## Details of fi nancial assets - not due, past due and impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2019. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days.

The ageing of trade receivables is given below:

Refer note 2.4 B of these fi nancial statements for the activity in the allowance for credit losses.

## Loans and advances

Loans and advances are predominantly given to subsidiaries for the purpose of working capital and other business requirements.

Refer note 2.4 C of these fi nancial statements for the activity in the allowance for doubtful advances.

Other than trade receivables and loans and advances, the Company has no significant class of financial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ' 33,327 and ' 14,209 respectively.

The table below provides details regarding the contractual maturities of signifi cant fi nancial liabilities (other than long-term loans, borrowings and obligations under fi nance leases, which have been disclosed in note 2.8 A to these fi nancial statements) as at 31 March 2019:

## 2.30 Contingent liabilities and commitments

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more significant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected fi nancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case. The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs Prices Control Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specified product" and fix the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfloxacin as a "specified product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fixing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fi xed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

## 2.30 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

The Company fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA fi led a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfl oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fi xing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. The matter is adjourned to 11 September 2019 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and anti-diabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notifi ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA filed an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application fi led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition, with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had fi led, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company fi led a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice.

Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to file a final counter affi davit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could file a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter affi davit was fi led by the Union of India. The Company subsequently filed a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 22 July 2019 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 342 under "selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were fi led against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifically, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plaintiffs in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plaintiffs right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were filed against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multi-product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrong doing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company fi led a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plaintiff s fi led opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was fi led by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the financial statements of the Company.

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafi l fi nished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and finished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the filing of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. In this regard, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of the said denial, was also denied.

The Commercial Court, Hyderabad has accepted the request of the Company to withdraw the suit, in view of the Court granting the Company's motion of Dr. Reddy's to fi le a Counterclaim in U.S. Action.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (iii) Securities Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, its Chief Executive Offi cer, and its Chief Financial Offi cer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Offi cer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public filings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws, and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were affected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 25 June 2018, the plaintiff s fi led an opposition to the motion to dismiss and, on 25 July 2018, a further reply in support of the motion to dismiss was fi led by the Company. In August 2018, oral argument on the motion to dismiss was heard by the Court.

## 2.30 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (iv) Glenmark Litigation

- In November 2017, the Company received a letter from Glenmark Farmaceutica Ltda and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (collectively "Glenmark"), for invocation of arbitration under a distribution agreement and a deed of assignment relating to a product between the Company and Glenmark. Glenmark alleged that the non-supply of the product by the Company severely affected the value of the intellectual Property and goodwill and asserted claims to recover the loss along with interest and penalties from the Company.

In March 2018, an arbitrator was appointed by the Supreme Court of India at Glenmark's request. In July 2018, Glenmark filed a claim statement against the Company and in September 2018, the Company fi led a reply against the claim along with a counter claim.

Glenmark filed a reply to the counter claim of the Company in November 2018 and the issues were finalised, inspection of documents along with the filing of the statement of Admissions and Denials was completed in December 2018. The Company was asked to submit the list of witnesses by 5 March 2019.

Affi davits in chief examination were filed by witnesses of the Company and Glenmark. The cross examination of the witnesses of Glenmark commenced and is anticipated to continue until July 2019.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. No provision was made in the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (v) Environmental matters Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company along with the alleged polluting industries has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently fi led a review petition against the judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017, in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company fi led an appeal challenging this judgement.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgement in July 2018 and directed the respondents to fi le their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents filed counter affi davits and the matter has now been adjourned for fi nal hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgement of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued GO.Ms. No 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded fi nancial year i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the fi nancial statements.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

The challenge to the APP Appellate Board's decision is transferred to the NGT, Delhi for a final hearing, the date for which has not yet been notifi ed. No provision relating to these claims has been made in the fi nancial statements.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notification that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notifi cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 297. The Company has responded to such demand notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable.

## (vii) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to addit ional fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (viii) Direct taxes related matters

The Company is contesting various disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 2,008. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavourable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and, accordingly, no provision is made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2019.

The Company believes that possibility of any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2019.

## (ix) Others

On 28 February 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a judgement which provided further guidance for companies in determining which components of their employees' compensation are subject to statutory withholding obligations, and matching employer contribution obligations, for Provident Fund contributions under Indian law. There are numerous interpretative issues relating to this judgement. However, the Company has made a provision on a prospective basis from the date of the Supreme Court's judgement. The Company will evaluate the same and update its provision, if any on receiving further clarity on the subject.

Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse eff ect on its fi nancial statements.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated Ind AS financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Holding Company"), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group") and joint ventures comprising of the Consolidated Balance sheet as at 31 March 2019, the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as "the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements").

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other financial information of the subsidiaries, the aforesaid consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group, and joint ventures as at 31 March 2019, their consolidated profit including other comprehensive income,their consolidated cash fl ows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specifi ed under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2019. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfi lled the responsibilities described in the Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Carrying value of intangible assets, intangible assets under development and goodwill (as described in note 1.3(g) and 1.3(j) of the signifi cant accounting policies, and note 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4 for details and movement in goodwill, intangible assets and intangible assets under development in the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of management's controls in assessing the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We assessed the Group's methodology applied in determining the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We assessed the Company's valuation methodology applied in deriving the recoverable value.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the assumptions applied to key inputs such as discount rates, sales volume and prices, long term growth rates and terminal values, which included comparing these inputs with assumptions made by the management in prior years.

As at 31 March 2019, the Company has ' 18,124 million of intangible assets, ' 24,610 million of intangible assets under development and ' 4,659 million of goodwill. The carrying value of these intangible assets are based on future cash flows and there is a risk that the assets may be impaired if cash flows are not in line with projections.

Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to management's assessment of recoverable amount, being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell, involving significant judgment and are based on number of variables and estimates including projection of future sales, operating costs and profit margins; appropriate discount rate and terminal value growth rate; and probability of technical and regulatory success factors in applying discounted cash fl ow valuation methodology.

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We discussed potential changes in key drivers as compared to previous year / actual performance with management to evaluate whether the inputs and assumptions used in the cash fl ow forecasts were suitable.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We also assessed the recoverable value headroom by performing sensitivity testing of key assumptions used.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the adequacy of financial statement disclosures, including disclosures of key assumptions, judgements and sensitivities.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(l) of the signifi cant accounting policies, and note 2.33(A) containing details of contingencies in the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements)

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at different levels in the group, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Company's in house legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We have compared the said evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. We have tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We solicited legal letters from the Company's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate we examined correspondences connected with the cases.

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company, assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a caseto-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation. The aforesaid assessment may result in an incorrect disclosure or provision in the books of account.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgemental (due to the diffi culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We obtained the details of tax assessments and demands as at the year ended 31 March 2019. We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities. We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of the tax exposures and assessed management's conclusions on whether exposures are probable, contingent or remote. Where exposures are assessed as probable, we evaluated the amounts provided with respect to those exposures.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We also evaluated the disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

Rebates, discounts and chargebacks, etc. in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(m) of the of the significant accounting policies in the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements and note 2.13 of the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements)

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for sales returns and chargeback, rebates & discounts, etc. The estimates relating to the accruals are important given the significance of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires signifi cant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

## Our audit procedures included the following:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> We assessed and performed test of controls over the completeness, recognition and measurement of accruals.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> We obtained Management's calculations for accruals and assessed the assumptions used by reference to the company's stated commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated financial position, consolidated fi nancial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash flows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group and joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal fi nancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

## Auditors' Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to infl uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal fi nancial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated Ind AS financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Obtain suffi cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group and its joint ventures of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated Ind AS financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signifi cant audit fi ndings, including any signifi cant defi ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2019 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors' report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefi ts of such communication.

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited as of and for the year ended 31 March 2019, we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company") and its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating eff ectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable fi nancial information, as required under the Act.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, both, issued by Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, and deemed to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal fi nancial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated Ind AS financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

A company's internal financial control over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated Ind A S fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting With Reference to these Consolidated Ind AS Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS fi nancial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over fi nancial reporting with reference to these consolidated Ind AS financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Please refer note 2.26 for list of subsidiaries, step-down subsidiaries and joint ventures of the parent company.

## 1.2 Basis of preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements

## a) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2019 have been prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015 and as amended from time to time.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective or elected for early adoption at the Company's annual reporting date, 31 March 2019. These consolidated fi nancial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on 17 May 2019.

## b) Basis of measurement

These consolidated fi nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> derivative fi nancial instruments are measured at fair value;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> fi nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost, depending on the classifi cation;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> employee defi ned benefit assets/(liabilities) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for actuarial gains/(losses) and the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> long-term borrowings, except obligations under finance leases, are measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest rate method;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> assets held for sale are measured at fair value less costs to sell;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> share-based payments are measured at fair value; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.

## c) Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All fi nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these entities are largely restricted to importing of fi nished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash flows realised from sale of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis.

The costs incurred by these entities are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The financing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been generally determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions, unless use of a different currency is considered appropriate.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signifi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.2(c) - Assessment of functional currency;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(b) - Evaluation of joint arrangements;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(d) - Financial instruments;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(e) - Business combinations;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Notes 1.3(f) and 1.3(g) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(i) - Valuation of inventories;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(j) - Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(k) - Assets and obligations relating to employee benefi ts;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(k) - Share-based payments;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(l) - Provisions and other accruals;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(m) - Measurement of transaction price in a revenue transaction (Sales returns, rebates and chargeback provisions);
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(o) - Evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Note 1.3(l) - Contingencies

## e) Current and non-current classifi cation

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.

## Assets:

An asset is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classifi ed as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always disclosed as non-current.

## 1.3 Significant accounting policies

## a) New Standards adopted by the Company

## Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In March 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs ("MCA") has notified Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2018. This comprehensive new standard supersedes Ind AS 18, Revenue , Ind AS 11, Construction contracts and related interpretations. The new standard amends revenue recognition requirements and establishes principles for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

The Company adopted Ind AS 115 effective as of 1 April 2018. The impacts of the adoption of the new standard are summarised below:

## Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sale of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements, each as more particularly described below. Most of such revenue (approximately 97%) is generated from the sale of goods.

## Sale of goods

Revenue from sale of goods consists of the sale of generic and branded products and the sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised where control is transferred to the Company's customers at the time of shipment to or receipt of goods by the customers. There was no change in the point of recognition of revenue upon adoption of Ind AS 115.

## Service income

Service income, which primarily relates to revenue from contract research, is recognised as and when the underlying services are performed. There was no change in the point of recognition of revenue upon adoption of Ind AS 115. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements continue to be deferred and are recognised over the expected period that related services are to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfi ed. The adoption of Ind AS 115 did not signifi cantly change the timing or amount of revenue recognised by the Company from these arrangements, nor did it change accounting for these royalty arrangements, as the standard's royalty exception is applied for intellectual property licenses. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements continue to be deferred and are recognised over the expected period that related services are to be performed.

## Profi t share revenues and milestone payments

Revenues from sale of goods also include revenues from profit sharing arrangements with business partners for sales of the Company's products in certain markets. Furthermore, the Company receives milestone payments related to out-licensing of the intellectual property.

Under Ind AS 115, the profit share amount is recognised only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of profi t share will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the profi t share is subsequently resolved. The adoption of Ind AS 115 did not signifi cantly change the timing or amount of revenue recognised by the Company under these arrangements.

The Company applied the modified retrospective method upon adoption of Ind AS 115 on 1 April 2018. This method requires the recognition of the cumulative effect of initially applying Ind AS 115 to retained earnings and not to restate prior years.

Overall, the application of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's revenue streams from the sale of goods, service income, license fees, profi t share revenues and milestone payments, and associated rebates and sales returns provisions.

## b) Basis of consolidation

## Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The fi nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Non-controlling interests ("NCI") in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profi t or loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Joint arrangements (equity accounted investees)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Company has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic fi nancial and operating decisions.

A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

With respect to joint operations, the Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the NCI holders have certain significant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in significant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial statements, the accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. Furthermore, the financial statements of the joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as of the Company.

## Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Company's interest in the investee.

## Acquisition of NCI

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the difference arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## Loss of Control

Upon loss of control, the Company derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any NCIs and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. If the Company retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, depending on the level of influence retained, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an investment measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI") or fair value through profit and loss account ("FVTPL"), under Ind AS 109.

## c) Foreign currency

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- GLYPH<circlesolid> certain debt instruments classifi ed as measured at fair value through other comprehensive income;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> a fi nancial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is eff ective; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> qualifying cash fl ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are eff ective.

Consolidated

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## Foreign operations

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as a part of foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR").

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the reporting currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the reporting currency at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency diff erences are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, such that control, signifi cant influence or joint control is lost, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## d) Financial instruments

A fi nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

All fi nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain signifi cant fi nancing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any signifi cant fi nancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115.

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

Debt instruments at amortised cost

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included in other income in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the eff ective interest rate method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS103 applies, are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classifi cation is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheet) when:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> the rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired; or
- GLYPH<circlesolid> Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other fi nancial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All fi nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of fi nancial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading and fi nancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfi ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The Company has not designated any fi nancial liability as fair value through profi t and loss.

## Loans and borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an exist ing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially diff erent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modifi cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, South African rands ("ZAR"), Romanian new leus ("RON") and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash fl ows.

## e) Business combinations

In accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 101, First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards , the Company has elected to apply accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any NCI in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the OCI and accumulates the same in equity as capital reserve where there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase else the gain is directly recognised in equity as capital reserve. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company recognises any NCI in the acquiree either at fair value or at the NCI's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination, such as fi nder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

Consolidated

## f) Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life, whichever is shorter.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                                 | Years    |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                   |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings      | 20 to 50 |
| - Ancillary structures                      | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and machinery                         | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi  ce equipment | 3 to 10  |
| Vehicles                                    | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed as such under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## g) Goodwill and other intangible assets

## Recognition and measurement

Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of NCI in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of identifi able net assets acquired.

Goodwill

Other intangible assets

Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have fi nite useful lives are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

Research and development

Separate acquisition of intangible assets

In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets under development

Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognised as In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets under development. IPR&D assets are not amortised, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such IPR&D assets is recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Subsequent expenditure

Other intangible assets

In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets under development

Subsequent expenditures are capitalised only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which they relate. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred. Subsequent expenditure on an IPR&D project acquired separately or in a business combination and recognised as an intangible asset is:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is a research expenditure;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is a development expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> added to the carrying amount of the acquired in-process research or development project, if it is a development expenditure that satisfi es the recognition criteria in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38.

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                  | Years   |
|------------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles  | 3 to 15 |
| Customer related intangibles | 1 to 11 |
| Other intangibles            | 3 to 15 |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditures are capitalised only if:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> development costs can be measured reliably;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> the product or process is technically and commercially feasible;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> future economic benefi ts are probable; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> the Company intends to, and has suffi cient resources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.

The expenditures to be capitalised include the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use. Other development expenditures are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred. As of 31 March 2019, none of the development expenditure amounts has met the aforesaid recognition criteria.

Payments to third parties that generally take the form of up-front payments and milestones for in-licensed products, compounds and intellectual property are capitalised. The Company's criteria for capitalisation of such assets are consistent with the guidance given in paragraph 25 of Indian Accounting Standard 38 ("Ind AS 38") (i.e., the receipt of economic benefits embodied in each intangible asset separately purchased or licensed in the transaction is considered to be probable).

Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying value of the equity accounted investee.

Consolidated

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## h) Leases

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under fi nance leases are apportioned between the fi nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding lease liability.

The fi nance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

## i) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and fi nished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## j) Impairment

## Non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defi ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash infl ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash infl ows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefi t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are al located fi rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## k) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefit obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defi ned benefit plan, recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in employee benefit expense, refl ects the increase in the defi ned benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defi ned benefi t plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

Consolidated

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.

The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## l) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the consolidate statement of profi t and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outfl ow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an infl ow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefi ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## m) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods.

Accounting policies relating to revenue for the periods after 31 March 2018 are as follows:

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates. Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

| Particulars                                    | Point of recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales of generic products in India             | Upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company.  Control over the generic products is transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to  distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. |
| Sales of active pharmaceutical                 | Upon delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories  of the Company.                                                                                                                               |
| ingredients and intermediates in India         | Upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide  for specific revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised                                             |
| Export sales and other sales outside  of India | once all such activities are completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signifi cant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

Consolidated

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition upon the expiration of limited competition or exclusivity periods. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability, the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

Accounting policies relating to revenue for periods ending on or prior to 31 March 2018 are as follows:

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods includes relevant taxes and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

Revenue from sales of generic products in India is recognised upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company. Significant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of generic products are transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. Clearing and forwarding agents are generally compensated on a commission basis as a percentage of sales made by them.

Revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in India is recognised upon delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories of the Company.

Revenue from export sales and other sales outside of India is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred to the customers. Such transfer occurs upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for specific revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised once all such activities are completed.

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profit share is available. Otherwise, recognition is deferred to a subsequent period pending satisfaction of such collectability and measurability requirements. In measuring the amount of profit share revenue to be recognised for each period, the Company uses all available information and evidence, including any confirmations from the business partner of the profi t share amount owed to the Company, to the extent made available before the date the Company's Board of Directors authorises the issuance of its fi nancial statements for the applicable period.

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive, or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers and other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition upon the expiration of limited competition or exclusivity periods. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrently with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## Export entitlements

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of material consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

Consolidated

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## License fee

The Company from time to time enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling and other expenses.

## n) Other income and fi nance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classified as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities in the consolidated statement of cash fl ows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash fl ow hedges.

## o) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary diff erences:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profi t;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that the future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## p) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## q) Government grants

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## r) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The chief executive offi cer of the Company is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and accordingly is identifi ed as the chief operating decision maker.

## s) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any diff erence between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## t) Recent accounting pronouncements

Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted by the Company

## Ind AS 116, Leases

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) notifi ed Ind AS 116, Leases as part of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases with eff ect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

Upon adoption, a portion of the annual operating lease expense will be recognised as finance expense. Further, a portion of the annual lease payments recognised in the consolidated statement of cash flow as reduction of lease liability will be recognised as outfl ow from fi nancing activities, which are currently fully recognised as an outfl ow from operating activities.

The undiscounted and non-cancellable operating lease commitments of ' 1,291 and ' 1,929 as at 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, respectively, as disclosed in note 2.30 to these consolidated financial statements, provide an indicator of the impact of implementation of Ind AS 116 on the consolidated financial statements of the Company. Accordingly, the Company believes that the adoption of Ind AS 116 will not have a material impact on its consolidated fi nancial statements.

Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, to Ind AS 12, Income Taxes

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) made certain amendments to Ind AS 12, Income taxes by including Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments . This appendix clarifies how the recognition and measurement requirements of Ind AS 12 are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments.

Appendix C explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the applicable tax authority. For example, a decision to claim a deduction for a specifi c expense or not to include a specific item of income in a tax return is an uncertain tax treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under applicable tax law. The amendment provides specific guidance in several areas where previously Ind AS 12 was silent. Appendix C applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable profit or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.

Consolidated

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019. An entity can, on initial application, elect to apply this amendment either:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> retrospectively applying Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors , if possible without the use of hindsight; or
- GLYPH<circlesolid> retrospectively, with the cumulative effect of initially applying the interpretation recognised at the date of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate).

The Company believes that the adoption of amendments to Ind AS 12 in the form of Appendix C will not have a material impact on its consolidated fi nancial statements.

## u) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million currency units unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefi ts.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and int erest cashfl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

## 2.2 Goodwill

Goodwill arising upon business combinations is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired. Gross carrying value and accumulated amortisation with respect to goodwill represent Indian GAAP balances, that have been carried forward as such, relating to business combination entered before the transition date i.e., 1 April 2015.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill (other than those arising upon investment in a joint venture) was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Particulars                              | As at 31 March 2019   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| PSAI-Active Pharmaceutical Operations    | 153                   |
| Global Generics-Complex Injectables      | 1,747                 |
| Global Generics-North America Operations | 303                   |
| Global Generics-Germany Operations       | 2,071                 |
| Global Generics-Branded Formulations     | 375                   |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value in use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash flows. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash fl ows for fi ve years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used range from 6.97% to 13.74% for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rates range from 7.56% to 16.63%.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## 2.6 B Trade receivables (continued)

During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Company entered into an arrangement with a bank for sale of trade receivables. Under the arrangement, the Company sold to the Bank certain of its trade receivables forming part of its Global Generics segment, on a non-recourse basis. The receivables sold were mutually agreed with the Bank after considering the credit worthiness of the customers and also other contractual terms with the customer including any gross to net adjustments due to rebates, discounts etc. from the contracted amounts, such that the receivables sold are generally lower than the net amount receivables from trade receivables. The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such receivables sold to the Bank and accordingly, the same are derecognised in the consolidated balance sheet. As on 31 March 2019, the amount of trade receivables de-recognised pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement was ' 7,592 (US$ 110 million).

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on its trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers. The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018 are as follows:

- * Currently, the Company does not separately track provisions and adjustments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks. However, the adjustments are expected to be non-material. The volumes used to calculate the closing balance of chargebacks represent approximately 1.1 months equivalent of sales, which corresponds to the pending chargeback claims yet to be processed.
- ** Currently, the Company does not separately track the credits and payments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks, rebates, medicaid payments or refund liability.
- (1) Chargebacks and rebates provisions for the year ended 31 March 2018 and payments for the year ended 31 March 2018 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2017, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for chargebacks, due to a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products, and due to certain product mix changes.
- (2) Chargebacks and rebates provisions for the year ended 31 March 2019 and payments for the year ended 31 March 2019 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2018, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for chargebacks, and due to a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products.

The estimates of "gross-to-net" adjustments for the Company's operations in India and other countries outside of the United States relate mainly to refund liability in all such operations, and certain rebates to healthcare insurance providers are specific to the Company's German operations. The pattern of such refund liability is generally consistent with the Company's gross sales. In Germany, the rebates to healthcare insurance providers mentioned above are contractually fi xed in nature and do not involve signifi cant estimations by the Company.

The Company's overall refund liability as at 31 March 2019 relating to its North America operations was US$ 30 million, as compared to a liability of US$ 28 million as at 31 March 2018. This increase in the Company's liability was primarily attributable to a higher refund liability created for the year ended 31 March 2019 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2018 , which allowance change was primarily based on certain product mix changes and recent trends in actual sales returns, together with the Company's historical experience, in the markets in which it operates.

## Details of contract asset:

As mentioned in the accounting policies for refund liability set forth in note 1.3 (m) of these consolidated financial statements, the Company recognises an asset, (i.e., right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

As on 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, the Company had ' 16 and ' 17, respectively, as contract assets representing the right to returned goods.

## Out-licensing agreement with CHD Biosciences Inc.:

In July 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with CHD Biosciences Inc for out-licensing the Phase III clinical trial candidate, DFA-02. As part of the agreement, the Company is entitled to receive equity shares in CHD valued at US$ 30 million upon an initial public off ering of CHD or, if no initial public offering occurs within 18 months of execution of the agreement, a cash payment of US$ 30 million. The Company will also receive additional milestone payments of US$ 40 million upon U.S. FDA approval. In addition, the Company is entitled to royalties on sales and certain other commercial milestone payments with respect to the product. At the time of execution, as the arrangement did not meet all of the revenue recognition criteria, no revenue has been recognised for the transaction during the year ended 31 March 2018. During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Company terminated the agreement with Armis Biopharma, Inc. (formerly known as CHD Bioscience, Inc.) and regained the world-wide rights to DFA-02.

## Gratuity benefits provided by the parent company

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a defi ned benefit plan which provides for gratuity payments (the "Gratuity Plan") and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund") to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by the Government of India and in debt securities and equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018 consist of the following:

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan, 2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of DRL (the "Committee") administer the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and five years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2018 Plan provides for option grants having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant as follows:

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control.

As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted during the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018 were as follows:

The decrease in the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2019 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2018 was primarily on account of the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries in the United States due to the enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the United States on 22 December 2017. Due to this enactment, the Company re-measured its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new tax law. This resulted in a charge of ' 1,269 for the year ended 31 March 2018, primarily to reflect the impact on the Company's U.S. deferred tax assets of the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the new tax law, and the tax deduction in the year ended 31 March 2019, of an item which was previously disallowed for tax purposes.

## d) Unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities

The details of unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarised below:

| Particulars                            | As at  31 March 2019   | As at  31 March 2018   |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Deductible temporary diff erences, net | 5,479                  | 4,977                  |
| Operating tax loss carry-forward       | 3,567                  | 4,030                  |
|                                        | 9,046                  | 9,007                  |

During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Company, based on probable future taxable profit, has recognised previously unrecognised deferred tax assets pertaining to carry forward tax losses in Dr. Reddy's Farmaceutica Do Brasil Ltda.

During the year ended 31 March 2019, the Company did not recognise deferred tax assets of ' 502 on certain deductible temporary differences, as the Company believes that it is not probable that there will be available taxable profits against which such temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of ' 34,023 as at 31 March 2019, of subsidiaries outside India, where it is expected that earnings of the subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. Generally, the Company indefinitely reinvests all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and accordingly, has not recorded any deferred taxes in relation to such undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. It is impracticable to determine the taxes payable when these earnings are remitted.

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary diff erences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefits of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Operating loss carry forward consists of business losses, unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed interest carry-forwards. A portion of this total loss can be carried indefinitely and the remaining amounts expire at various dates ranging from 2020 through 2029.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## 2.31 Financial instruments (continued)

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

A net loss of ' 28, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the finance costs. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of finance cost, a net loss of ' 0 and a net gain of ' 9 for the year ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018 respectively.

The Company had outstanding interest swap arrangements that hedged a portion of interest rate risk arising from floating rate, dollar denominated foreign currency borrowing of US$ 50 million and US$ 50 million as at 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, respectively.

## 2.32 Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in United States dollars, Russian roubles, U.K pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars, Russian roubles , Ukrainian hryvnias, South African rands, Mexican pesos and Euros). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.31 to these consoli dated fi nancial statements.

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> a ' 1 ,872/(1,349) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 1,789/(1,873) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2019;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> a ' 1,277/(1,338) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 403/(308) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2018.

For the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 857 and ' 175, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2019, the Company had ' 31,154 of loans carrying a floating interest rate ranging from 1 Month LIBOR plus 25 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 105 bps; ' 72 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month JIBAR plus 120 bps; and ' 1,749 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of TIIE+1.25%. As of 31 March 2018, the Company had ' 42,592 of loans carrying a floating interest rate ranging from 1 Month LIBOR minus 30 bps to 1 Month/3 Months LIBOR plus 85 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profiles, refer to note 2.10 A and B of these consolidated fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR, JIBAR and TIIE) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 93 and ' 77, respectively.

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings, interest component of which designated in a cash flow hedge, was ' 3,458 as of 31 March 2019. In respect of these borrowings, a 10% decrease/increase in the interest rates of such borrowings would have resulted in a ' 14/(12) increase/decrease in the Company's hedging reserve as at 31 March 2019.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2019, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

Financial risk management (continued)

## b) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signifi cant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

## c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As of 31 March 2019 and 31 March 2018, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ' 47,134 and ' 24,046 respectively.

Contingent liabilities and commitments

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more significant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected fi nancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case. The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

## Launch of product

On 14 June 2018, the U.S. FDA granted the Company final approval for Buprenorphine and Naloxone Sublingual Film, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg dosages, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Suboxone® sublingual fi lm. The U.S. FDA approval came after the conclusion of litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware, (the "Delaware District Court"), where the Delaware District Court held that patents covering Suboxone® sublingual film would not be infringed by the Company's commercial launch of its generic sublingual film product. In light of the favourable decision from the Delaware District Court, the Company launched its generic sublingual film product in the U.S. immediately following the U.S. FDA approval on 14 June 2018. Indivior has appealed the Delaware District Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("Court of Appeals"). Oral argument on Indivior's appeal occurred on 2 April 2018. The parties are awaiting a ruling from the Court of Appeals.

After the Delaware Court's decision, Indivior filed a second lawsuit against the Company alleging infringement of three additional patents in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey, styled Indivior Inc. et al. v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories S.A., Civil Action No. 2:17-cv-07111 (D.N.J.) (the "New Jersey District Court"). Following the launch, on 15 June 2018, Indivior PLC ("Indivior") filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Company in the New Jersey District Court. Indivior's motion alleged that the Company's generic sublingual film product infringed one of three patents at issue in the New Jersey District Court. Pending a hearing and decision on the injunction application, the New Jersey District Court initially issued a temporary restraining order against the Company with respect to further sales, offer for sales, and imports of its generic sublingual film product in the United States. Subsequently, on 14 July 2018, the New Jersey District Court granted a preliminary injunction in favour of Indivior. Under the Order, Indivior required to and did post a bond of US$ 72 million to pay the costs and damages sustained by the Company if it was found to be wrongfully enjoined. The Company immediately appealed the decision and Court of Appeals agreed to expedite the appeal.

The Court of Appeals heard oral argument on the Company's appeal on 4 October 2018. On 20 November 2018, the Court of Appeals issued a decision vacating the preliminary injunction. On 20 December 2018, Indivior fi led a petition seeking rehearing of the appeal and the Court of Appeals asked the Company to respond to Indivior's petition on 16 January 2019. The Company filed its response to Indivior's petition, for rehearing on 17 January 2019. On 4 February 2019, the Federal Circuit Court denied Indivior's petition for rehearing. Indivior subsequently fi led two emergency motions in the Federal Circuit Court to stay issuance of the mandate to vacate the preliminary injunction, which the Federal Circuit Court denied. Indivior then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to stay issuance of the mandate. Indivior's petition was denied by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on 19 February 2019 and the mandate was issued on the same day. The Company resumed its launch of its generic Suboxone product after the mandate was issued. Litigation has resumed in the New Jersey District Court. No trial date has been set by the New Jersey District Court.

The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions and pursue a claim for damages caused by the preliminary injunction. Any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated financial statements of the Company.

## Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specified product" and fix the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfloxacin as a "specified product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fixing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fi xed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price.

In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA filed a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfloxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fixing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. The matter is adjourned to 11 September 2019 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and anti-diabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notifi ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA filed an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application fi led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition, with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPP A issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had fi led, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company fi led a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to file a final counter affi davit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could file a rejoinder.

On 10 May 2018, the counter affi davit was filed by the Union of India. The Company subsequently filed a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 22 July 2019 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 342 under "selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Other product and patent related matters

## Child resistant packaging matter complaint under the False Claims Act ("FCA")

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged in a letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the "CPSA") and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the "PPPA") and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Specifically, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certificates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC's allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") began to investigate a sealed complaint which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") related to these same issues (the "FCA Complaint"). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the Company, proceeded without the DOJ's and applicable States' involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company's generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company filed its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and allowing the plaintiffs one more chance to refile this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations. On 29 March 2017, the plaintiff s fi led their final amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff s fi led a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

The parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ's offi ce in Washington, D.C. in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ relates to fi ve of the blister pack products.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for a civil penalty of US$ 5 million ( ' 319) and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the Company has not admitted any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

During the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiff s subsequently filed a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

In June 2018, the plaintiff s fi led their Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. During the three months ended September 2018, the plaintiffs and the DOJ settled and thus this appeal was dismissed. The plaintiffs then filed an application for recovery of attorneys' fees from the Company under the "alternative remedy doctrine." The Company made opposing filings to this and in response the plaintiff s withdrew their application.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the FCA Complaint is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.$^{(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)}$

## Namenda Litigation

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health & Welfare Fund ("Sergeants") filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the Alzheimer's drug Namenda® (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009 until 2010. Sergeants seeks to represent a class of "end-payor" purchasers of Namenda® tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding Namenda® tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator's attempt to shift sales from the original immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product. The Company believes that the complaint lacks merit and that the Company's conduct complied with all applicable laws and regulations.

Defendants' motions to dismiss were denied. A stay on discovery has been lifted and some discovery has been taken but there is currently no schedule in place. Four other class action complaints, each containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint, have also been fi led in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. However, two of those complaints were voluntarily dismissed, and the other two do not name the Company as a defendant.

In addition, the State of New York filed an antitrust case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set forth in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of alleged violation of federal antitrust laws is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were fi led against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifically, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plaintiffs in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plaintiffs right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were filed against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multi-product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrong doing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company fi led a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plaintiff s fi led opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was fi led by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## United States Antitrust Multi-District Litigation

The following cases against the Company's U.S. subsidiary, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., have been filed and are pending and consolidated in In re Generic Pharmaceutical Pricing Antitrust Litigation, MDL 2724, 14-MD-2724 (Eastern District of Pennsylvania) , Multi District Litigation ("MDL") in the Eastern District Pennsylvania ("MDL-2724"):

- a) U.S. States Attorneys General Antitrust Complaints

On 30 October 2017, the Attorneys General of forty-nine U.S. States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, fi led an Amended Complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, against eighteen generic pharmaceutical companies (including the Company's U.S. subsidiary) with respect to fifteen generic drugs, alleging that the Company's U.S. subsidiary and the other named defendants engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and to allocate bids and customers in the United S tates in the sale of thefi fteen named drugs. The Company's U.S. subsidiary is specifically named as a defendant with respect to two generic drugs (meprobamate and zoledronic acid), and is named as an alleged co-conspirator on an alleged "overarching conspiracy" with respect to the other thirteen generic drugs named. The Amended Complaint alleges violations of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §1, and the consumer protection and antitrust laws of each of the jurisdictions that are plaintiff s.

The Amended Complaint seeks injunctive relief, statutory penalties, punitive damages, and recovery of treble damages, plus attorney's fees and costs, against all named defendants on a joint and several basis, on behalf of the plaintiff jurisdictions and their citizens and inhabitants. The Company denies the claims asserted and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted.

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafi l fi nished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and finished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the filing of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. In this regard, the Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of the said denial, was also denied.

The Commercial Court, Hyderabad has accepted the request of the Company to withdraw the suit, in view of the Court granting the Company's motion of Dr. Reddy's to fi le a Counterclaim in U.S. Action.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint.

The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Offi cer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public filings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws, and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were affected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 25 June 2018, the plaintiff s fi led an opposition to the motion to dismiss and, on 25 July 2018, a further reply in support of the motion to dismiss was fi led by the Company. In August 2018, oral argument on the motion to dismiss was heard by the Court.

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the Court dismissed the plaintiff's claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (iv) Glenmark Litigation

In November 2017, the Company received a letter from Glenmark Farmaceutica Ltda and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Limited (collectively "Glenmark"), for invocation of arbitration under a distribution agreement and a deed of assignment relating to a product between the Company and Glenmark.

In March 2018, an arbitrator was appointed by the Supreme Court of India at Glenmark's request. In July 2018, Glenmark filed a claim statement against the Company and in September 2018, the Company fi led a reply against the claim along with a counter claim.

## (vi) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently fi led a review petition against the judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017, in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company fi led an appeal challenging this judgement.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgement in July 2018 and directed the respondents to fi le their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents filed counter affi davits and the matter has now been adjourned for fi nal hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgement of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued GO.Ms. No 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded financial year i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the " APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

The challenge to the APP Appellate Board's decision is transferred to the NGT, Delhi for a final hearing, the date for which has not yet been notifi ed. No provision relating to these claims has been made in the consolidated fi nancial statements.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notification that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notifi cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various demand notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| April 2015 to March 2016          | '  157 plus interest and penalties            | The Company has submitted reply hearing awaited           |
| April 2016 to June 2017           | 307 plus interest and penalties               | The Company is in the process of responding to the notice |

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in these consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2019.

## Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company has received various demand notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded        | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| April 2009 to March 2011          | '  59 plus 10% penalty | The Company has filed an appeal before the Sales Tax Appellate  Tribunal. The matter was remanded to the original adjudicating  authority with a direction to re-calculate the eligibility for the year  ended 31 March 2010. |
| April 2011 to March 2013          | '  16 plus 10% penalty | The Appellate Deputy Commissioner issued an order partially in  favour of the Company                                                                                                                                         |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 51 as of 31 March 2019, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 297. The Company has responded to such demand notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2019.

## (viii) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

Consolidated

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments (continued)

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additi onal fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (ix) Direct taxes related matters

The Company is contesting various disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 2,008. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavourable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and, accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2019.

During the years ended 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016, Industrias Quimicas Falcon de Mexico, S.A. de CV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico, received a notice from Mexico's Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria ("SAT"), with respect to disallowance on account of transfer pricing adjustments pertaining to the calendar years ended 31 December 2006, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The associated tax impact is ' 739 (MXN 207 million) and profit share impact is ' 89 (MXN 25 million). The Company filed administrative appeals with the SAT by challenging these disallowances and, during February and March 2017, the Company received orders of the SAT confirming these disallowances by dismissing its administrative appeals. The Company disagrees with the SAT's disallowances and filed an appeal with the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa (Federal Tax and Administrative Court of Mexico) in March and April 2017.

The Company believes that possibility of any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2019.

## (x) Others

On 28 February 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued a judgement which provided further guidance for companies in determining which components of their employees ' compensation are subject to statutory withholding obligations, and matching employer contribution obligations, for Provident Fund contributions under Indian law. There are numerous interpretative issues relating to this judgement. However, the Company has made a provision on a prospective basis from the date of the Supreme Court's judgement. The Company will evaluate the same and update its provision, if any on receiving further clarity on the subject.

Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.

("Curis") to discover, develop and commercialise small molecule antagonists for immuno-oncology and precision oncology targets.Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene has the responsibility for conducting all discovery and preclinical activities, including Investigational New Drug ("IND") enabling studies and providing Phase 1 clinical trial supply, and Curis is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory and commercialisation efforts worldwide, excluding India and Russia. The Collaboration Agreement provides that the parties will collaborate exclusively in immuno-oncology for an initial period of approximately two years, with the option for Curis to extend the broad immuno-oncology exclusivity.

As partial consideration for the collaboration, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 18 January 2015, Curis issued to Aurigene 17.1 million shares of its common stock, representing 19.9% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to the transaction (approximately 16.6% of its outstanding common stock immediately after the transaction). Such shares were initially subject to a lock-up agreement. However, as of 31 March 2017, lock-up restrictions were released on all of the aforementioned 17.1 million shares. In connection with the issuance of such shares, Curis and Aurigene entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated 18 January 2015 which provides for certain registration rights with respect to resale of the shares. The common stock of Curis is listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Global Market.

## 2.34 Collaboration agreement with Curis, Inc. (continued)

The fair value of the shares of Curis common stock on the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement was ' 1,452 (US$ 23.5 million).

Revenues under the Collaboration Agreement consist of upfront consideration (including the shares of Curis common stock) and the development and commercial milestone payments described below, which are deferred and recognised as revenue over the period for which Aurigene has continuing performance obligations.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene is entitled to development and commercial milestone payments as follows:

- GLYPH<circlesolid> for the first two programs: up to US$ 52.5 million per program, including US$ 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any;
- GLYPH<circlesolid> for the third and fourth programs: up to US$ 50 million per program, including US$ 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any; and
- GLYPH<circlesolid> for any program thereafter: up to US$ 140.5 million per program, including US$ 87.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any.

In addition, Curis has agreed to pay Aurigene royalties, ranging between high single digits to 10%, on its net sales in territories where it commercialises products. Furthermore, Aurigene is entitled to receive a share of Curis' revenues from sublicenses, which share varies based upon specified factors such as the sublicensed territory, whether the sublicense revenue is royalty based or non-royalty based and, in some cases, the stage of the applicable molecule and product at the time the sublicense is granted.

On 7 September 2016, the Collaboration Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance to Aurigene of approximately 10.2 million additional shares of Curis common stock in lieu of receiving up to US$ 24.5 million of milestone and other payments from Curis that could have become due under the Collaboration Agreement. These shares of Curis common stock are recorded at US$ 1.84 per share, which is equal to the market price of such shares of common stock on the date of issuance, amounting to an aggregate market value of ' 1,247 (US$ 18.8 million).

As of 31 March 2019, lock-up restrictions were released on an aggregate of 10.2 million of such additional shares of Curis common stock, representing 100% of the shares which Aurigene received from Curis in 2016.

The Company has evaluated the transaction under Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures , and believes that the Company does not have any signifi cant influence with respect to Curis. Accordingly, all of the shares of Curis common stock are classifi ed as instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).

## ITEM NO. 4

Mr. Sridar Iyengar (aged 71 years, DIN: 00278512) was appointed as a director on the board of the company in August 2011. In terms of Section 149 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, Mr. Iyengar was appointed as an independent director for a period of five years, at the 30th AGM of the company held on 31 July 2014. Accordingly, his first term as a non-executive independent director is ending at the 35th AGM.

Section 149(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, provides that an independent director shall hold offi ce for a term up to fi ve consecutive years on the board of a company but shall be eligible for reappointment, for another term of up to five years, on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders.

In terms of Section 152 and Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013, outcome of his performance evaluation and recommendations of the nomination, governance and compensation committee (NGCC), the board is of the opinion that Mr. Iyengar fulfils the conditions for his reappointment as an independent director as specifi ed in the Companies Act, 2013 and the Listing Regulations and is independent of the management. The NGCC and the board strongly recommend the resolution for consideration of the members.

Accordingly, the company is seeking the approval of its members by way of a special resolution, in view of the aforementioned provisions, for reappointment of Mr. Iyengar for the second term of 4 (four) consecutive years from 31 July 2019 to 30 July 2023.

Further, according to Regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations, a listed entity shall appoint a person or continue the directorship of any person as a non-ex ecutive director who has attained seventy fi ve years of age only after the concerned listed company has obtained approval of its members by way of a special resolution. Since Mr. Iyengar will attain seventy five years during his tenure as an independent director in the second term, the company is seeking the approval of its members by way of a special resolution.

In July 2019, terms of four independent directors of the company will come to an end viz; Mr. Anupam Puri, Dr. Omkar Goswami, Mr. Sridar Iyengar and Ms. Kalpana Morparia. Mr. Anupam Puri completes his second term and Dr. Omkar Goswami does not seek reappointment. The company has appointed three new board members this year. Given this significant transition of the board, the board of directors believes that the continued presence of Mr. Iyengar is critical in maintaining its fiduciary continuity during this period of transition. Hence, the board believes that it is in the best interest of the company, to reappoint Mr. Iyengar as an independent director for the second term of 4 (four) consecutive years. The continued association of Mr. Iyengar would be of immense benefit to the company and will help the board to maintain continuity, given signifi cant changes in the composition of the board.

Mr. Iyengar is the chairperson of the audit committee and a member of the risk management committee. Further, the board of directors has determined that Mr. Iyengar is an audit committee fi nancial expert as defined in Item 401(h) of Regulations S-K, and is independent pursuant to applicable NYSE rules.

Considering the above, it is recommended to reappoint him as an independent director for the second term of 4 (four) consecutive years from 31 July 2019 up to 30 July 2023, not liable to retire by rotation, by passing the special resolution as set out in this notice.

The company has received, inter alia, (i) intimation in form DIR-8 pursuant to Rule 14 of the Companies (Appointment and Qualifi cation of Directors) Rules, 2014, from Mr. Iyengar to the effect that he is not disqualified in accordance with Section 164(2) of the Companies Act, 2013; (ii) declaration that he meets the criteria of independence as provided in the Companies Act, 2013 and Listing Regulations; (iii) declaration that he is not debarred or restrained from acting as a director by any SEBI order or by any other such authority; and (iv) a notice in writing from a member under Section 160 of the Act proposing the candidature of Mr. Iyengar as a director of the company.

Mr. Iyengar has physically attended four board meetings out of fi ve held during FY2019. He had requested and was granted leave of absence for one meeting. However, he participated in that meeting through tele-conference. He does not hold any equity shares in the company. For FY2019 he is entitled to a commission based remuneration as an independent director of ' 104.4 lakhs.

A copy of the draft letter of reappointment, setting out the terms and conditions of reappointment of Mr. Iyengar, is available for inspection, without any fee, by the members at the company's registered offi ce during business hours on all working days up to the date of the AGM.

Except Mr. Iyengar and his relatives, none of the other directors or key managerial personnel of the company and their relatives are concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, in the resolution set out in item no. 4 of the notice.

The board strongly recommends the special resolution set forth in item no. 4 of the notice for approval of the members.

## ITEM NO. 5

Ms. Kalpana Morparia (aged 70 years, DIN: 00046081) was appointed as a director on the board of the company in June 2007. In terms of Section 149 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 she was appointed as an independent director for a period of five years, at the 30th AGM of the company held on 31 July 2014. Accordingly, her fi rst term as a non-executive independent director is ending at the 35th AGM.

Section 149(10) of the Act, provides that an independent director shall hold offi ce for a term up to five consecutive years on the board of a company but shall be eligible for reappointment, for another term of up to five consecutive years, on passing of a special resolution by the members.

In terms of Section 152 and Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013, outcome of performance evaluation and recommendations of the nomination, governance and compensation committee (NGCC), the board is of the opinion that Ms. Morparia fulfils the conditions for her reappointment as an independent director as specifi ed in the Companies Act, 2013 and the Listing Regulations and is independent of the management. The NGCC and the board strongly recommend the resolution for consideration of the members.

Accordingly, the company is seeking the approval of its members by way of a special resolution, in view of the aforementioned provisions,

for reappointment of Ms. Morparia for the second term of 5 (fi ve) consecutive years from 31 July 2019 to 30 July 2024.

Further, according to Regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations, a listed entity shall appoint a person or continue the directorship of any person as a non-ex ecutive director who has attained seventy fi ve years of age only after the concerned listed company has obtained approval of its members by way of a special resolution. Since Ms. Morparia will attain seventy five years during her tenure as an independent director in the second term, the company is seeking the approval of its members by way of a special resolution.

In July 2019, terms of four independent directors of the company will come to an end viz; Mr. Anupam Puri, Dr. Omkar Goswami, Mr. Sridar Iyengar and Ms. Kalpana Morparia. Mr. Anupam Puri completes his second term and Dr. Omkar Goswami does not seek reappointment. The company has appointed three new board members this year. Given this significant transition of the board, the board of directors believes that the continued presence of Ms. Morparia is critical in maintaining its fiduciary continuity during this period of transition. Hence, the board believes that it is in the best interest of the company, to reappoint Ms. Morparia as an independent director for the second term of 5 (fi ve) consecutive years. The continued association of Ms. Morparia would be of immense benefit to the company and will help the board to maintain continuity, given significant changes in the composition of the board.

Ms. Morparia is the chairperson of the stakeholders' relationship committee and a member of the science, technology and operations committee. The continued association of Ms. Morparia would be of immense benefi t to the company.

Considering the above, it is recommended to reappoint her as an independent director for the second term of 5 (fi ve) consecutive years from 31 July 2019 up to 30 July 2024, not liable to retire by rotation by passing the special resolution as set out in this notice.

The company has received, inter alia, (i) intimation in form DIR-8 pursuant to Rule 14 of the Companies (Appointment and Qualifi cation of Directors) Rules, 2014, from Ms. Morparia to the effect that she is not disqualified in accordance with Section 164(2) of the Companies Act, 2013; (ii) declaration that she meets the criteria of independence as provided in the Companies Act, 2013 and Listing Regulations; (iii) declaration that she is not debarred or restrained from acting as a director by any SEBI order or by any other such authority; and (iv) a notice in writing from a member under Section 160 of the Act proposing the candidature of Ms. Morparia as a director of the company.

Ms. Morparia has attended all five board meetings held during FY2019. She holds 10,800 equity shares in the company. For FY2019 she is entitled to a commission based remuneration as an independent director of ' 96.8 lakhs.

A copy of the draft letter of reappointment, setting out the terms and conditions of reappointment of Ms. Morparia, is available for inspection, without any fee, by the members at the company's

registered offi ce during business hours on all working days up to the date of the AGM.

Except Ms. Morparia and her relatives, none of the other directors or key managerial personnel of the company and their relatives are concerned or interested, financially or otherwise, in the resolution set out in item no. 5 of the notice.

The board strongly recommends the resolution set forth in item no. 5 of the notice for approval of the members.
