## Letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman

K. SATISH REDDY Chairman

<!-- image -->

G.V. PRASAD Co-Chairman and Managing Director

<!-- image -->

In June 2022 at our Investor Day, we laid down our near-term and long-term strategy, roadmap, and renewed commitment to sustainability. This year's report will show you details of that strategy in progress.

As you are aware, apart from the Annual Report, we have released annual Sustainability Reports since 2004. Starting this year, we will move to an Integrated Report that combines the two. The Integrated Report will weave together the material aspects of our business and their interplay with our purpose, values, strategy, governance, performance and future outlook.

## Performance highlights

FY2023 was an exciting year for us - we achieved significant growth in sales, profits and generated a healthy cash flow driven by the opportunity in the USA.

Overall, the revenue for FY2023 stood at ₹24,588 crores ($2.99 billion), a growth of 15% over the previous year. Our EBITDA margin for the year was at 29.7% of revenue, ahead of our aspirational target of 25%. While we benefitted from the limited volume launch of lenalidomide and the sale of some non-strategic assets, we continue to improve the drivers in our core businesses for sustainable growth through productivity improvements, market share gains and new product launches.

Dear Shareholder,

We made good progress in FY2023 on multiple fronts. Our financial performance was driven by our growth in the USA. We made progress in biosimilar development, collaborations to bring novel therapies to India and in moving our sustainability agenda forward.

In FY2023, our North America Generics business as well as our Branded Generics (India and Emerging Markets) business became billion-dollar businesses for a second year in a row.

We completed the integration of the cardiovascular brand Cidmus acquired from Novartis in India, acquired Mayne Pharma's generic prescription portfolio in the USA, and Eton Pharma's branded and generic injectable products in the USA We also divested certain non-core brands in India to help us consolidate and strengthen our core as we aim to be a top 5 player in India. Our biosimilars pipeline also saw considerable progress. We successfully completed Phase I studies and initiated global Phase III studies of our proposed tocilizumab biosimilar via both the intravenous and subcutaneous routes. We completed the full set of clinical studies of our rituximab biosimilar for filing in the USA and Europe. Our partner launched our pegfilgrastim in the USA and Europe. We have initiated efforts to considerably expand our portfolio in our Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (API) business, create new offerings in our Contract Development and Manufacturing (CDMO) business in Aurigene Pharmaceutical Services (APSL), and to strengthen our Europe business. We made progress in our productivity journey, including initiatives in digitalisation.

Our largest manufacturing facility in Hyderabad was included by the World Economic Forum as part of its Global Lighthouse Network.

## Bringing innovation to the Indian patient

Alongside our current growth drivers above, we are also exploring business spaces that we think will shape the healthcare of the future. These include deepening our presence in nutraceuticals, cell and gene therapy and NCEs at our re-named subsidiary Aurigene Oncology Limited, and our CDMO services. We are also exploring new spaces such as integrated digital healthcare services, digital therapeutics, and disease management. While these are longgestation businesses, and we are early in their development, we have made some progress.

We have entered into multiple partnerships to initiate clinical trials and consequently commercialise in India, wearables for atria l fib rillation treatment and migraine management, a third-generation CAR-T asset, and a New Biological Entity (NBE) toripalimab.

As the pharmaceutical landscape evolves, we continue to work towards anticipating and investing in patient needs of the future.

## Sustainability central to strategy

Last year, we announced our renewed Environment, Social, Governance (ESG) goals. As a Company with over two decades of leadership in Indian pharma, we see it as our responsibility to set the bar high. Going beyond environment, we have set ourselves bold and measurable goals towards patients, employees and governance. The most distinctive aspect of our approach is that our sustainability agenda is now embedded in business

## Recognitions

Some of our efforts resulted in high honours for us in FY2023 - we received an award from the President of India on the International Day of Persons with Disabilities in December 2022 for our work in providing placement through Dr. Reddy's Foundation. For the sixth year in a row, we were the only Indiaheadquartered pharma Company in the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for 2023. We were recognised by the prestigious Science Magazine in 2022 as being among the top 20 employers in pharma/biotech globally, scoring well in 'treats employees with respect', 'is socially responsible' and 'provides employees with autonomy'. Beyond the social realm, recently, the Financial Times and Statista named us as an Asia-Pacific Climate Leader in their 2023 list. Each one of these recognitions is a humbling reminder of the years of effort it takes to achieve excellence and of the long road ahead.

We are grateful to all our shareholders, patients, the healthcare community, partners, customers, suppliers, regulators and our employees for their trust in us. We hope you find this Integrated Report a valuable source of information. We count on your support as we move towards the 40th year of our Company next year.

Yours Sincerely,

K. SATISH REDDY

strategy. In the following pages, you will read a more detailed update on the progress we have made on each of these goals. With each product and capability, we get closer to our main goal of serving over 1.5 billion patients by 2030.

One of the most satisfying indicators of progress for us is employee participation in our sustainability agenda. 'Good Health Can't Wait' is a movement and call to action for all of us.

It encompasses planet, patients, and people. From local park clean-ups to waste recycling and incorporating sustainable actions in their personal lives, our colleagues have taken up various activities of their own initiative over the past year. Pride of place among these activities goes to the six Sustainability Ambassador Programmes run by our Safety, Health, Environment & Sustainability team one each for road safety, women's safety, waste management, water conservation, energy conservation and health. Employees volunteer as part of these programmes to get certified, train fellow employees as well as communities around us in these areas.

As we hire more colleagues who are differently-abled or identify as transgender, we also organise sensitisation sessions internally to ensure that the Dr. Reddy's family is a welcoming and inclusive environment for our new colleagues and no one is left behind.

## Introducing our Integrated Reporting

We released our first Sustainability Report in the year 2004. Since then, we have published voluntary annual sustainability-related disclosures. In 2022, we integrated sustainability with our business strategy. Therefore, this year marks the introduction of our first Integrated Report - combining our Annual Report with our Sustainability Report. The Integrated Report weaves together our purpose, values, strategy, governance, performance and future outlook, all of which materially influence our business. Through this Report, we offer stakeholders a holistic view of the Company's growth and value creation over time, along with our business, strategy and performance in FY2023.

## Reporting boundary and period

This Integrated Annual Report includes the Statutory Reports, Audited Financial Statements, and covers the financial and non -fin ancial performance of our global operations for the period April 1, 2022 to March 31, 2023 (unless otherwise stated).

## Reporting on ESG

This Integrated Report provides an integrated view of how we embed sustainability into our business strategy, decisions, and operations. The Report contains our ESG commitment, outlook, and impact. It is guided by priority sustainability topics identified through a comprehensive stakeholder engagement and materiality assessment. This Report also provides disclosures on important topics such as our business environment, climate strategy, people practices, value chain partner engagement, and governance on ESG.

## Reporting frameworks

This Integrated Report has been prepared in reference to the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the International <IR> Framework of the International Integrated Reporting Council and the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021. The Report also includes the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR), prepared in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). We provide a mapping of the key linkages between the UN Global Compact's ten principles as a part of the GRI content index. It also illustrates how our initiatives contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).

## Responsibility statement

This report is a fair representation of our Company's financial, non-financial, sustainability, and operational performance for FY2023, and has been approved by the Board. Assurance on financial statements has been provided by the Statutory Auditors, M/s S R Batliboi & Associates LLP on pages 198 and 285 of this Integrated Annual Report. Non-financial information has been independently assured by DNV Business Assurance India Private Limited ('DNV'), an independent audit and assurance firm, and this is available on page 403 of this Integrated Annual Report.

## Materiality assessment

We aim to achieve our purpose through collaboration with a diverse range of stakeholders. With stakeholder interactions and strategic engagements, the Company gains a better understanding of their needs and expectations, leading to closer integration and progress towards our shared goals. We are guided by our materiality assessment to identify the key ESG topics in which we create the most impact and hold the highest potential to create value. This assessment is done in addition to the annual Enterprise Risk Management heat map that highlights the significant internal, external, and strategic risks faced by the Company.

In the previous materiality assessment in 2021, we worked with an independent third party to determine a list of material topics that could affect our performance and impact key business decisions. We engaged with over 100 internal and external stakeholders. These included employees from key business functions, as well as leaders and important stakeholders and external groups such as regulatory authorities, customers, investors, suppliers, and not-for-profit organisations. The results of the assessment contributed to the development of our ESG goals, and they continue to guide our sustainability strategy and public reporting.

We make efforts to address health inequities, provide life-saving products, and improve health outcomes through our work. We are constantly trying to increase our reach globally with affordable medicines and meaningful innovations for patients. We contribute to reducing the global disease burden by enabling access, affordability, and innovation.

## ADVANCING ACCESS TO HEALTH

Our access strategy is delivered by launching new products and providing generic alternatives to innovator medicines, increasing their reach and making medicines more affordable. We have identified several levers to achieve this:

- · Expanding market presence by establishing direct partnerships and linkages with intermediaries
- · Exploring new portfolio choices, licensing, and distribution arrangements
- · Collaborating with smaller companies with specialised drug development capabilities
- · Leveraging existing networks to in-license more products
- · Establishing multi-stakeholder partnerships with governments, international institutions, and public health institutions to expand and deepen our reach globally

This year, we reached over *689 million patients through our products and services. We reached approximately 180 million patients in 31 #LMICs (low and middle-income countries) in Emerging Markets and India. Vistara, our rural access programme reached 1,25,000 healthcare professionals and impacted over 50 million patients across 10,000 towns in India.

## Operational excellence

Our vision is to become one of the most efficient pharmaceutical operations globally. Productivity for us includes being first to market, cost leadership, supply chain flexibility, and going beyond compliance requirements. We follow a progressive productivity agenda, which will enhance our ability to deliver high-quality products to customers.

We apply principles of lean manufacturing and six sigma to optimise processes, reduce waste, and improve quality. We are using data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement to identify and eliminate non-value-added activities, reduce variation, and improve efficiency.

Our selection-to-commercial (S2C) initiative optimises the development, procurement, and production value chain to enable faster introduction of products, and an increase in the share of first-to-market products. Through the Autonomous Way of Working, we use Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) to create asset robustness, driving proficiency with operators to handle every know-how and asset maintenance activity. Statistical techniques and machine learning are used to improve the yield and quality (product robustness) of our products.

We have identified products based on prediction tools for proactive and reactive remediation to ensure Right First Time. We have created internal capabilities on Quality by Design (QbD) and Design of Experiments (DOE) to drive improvement projects.

## Product Quality

Patient safety is at the core of everything we do, and we remain committed to the highest standards of product quality by implementing a robust quality management system and building a quality-focused culture.

Our Quality Management System (QMS) lays emphasis on the appropriate management of resources, and management of quality through the entire product lifecycle, including periodic reviews at manufacturing site level, business unit level and senior management level.

We are driving operational transformation through a Factory of Future initiative, an integrated 5-pillar approach that uses lean principles with the enablement of digital technologies, mechanisation, and automation for implementing intelligent and sustainable processes. Our key pillars include:

Data acquisition and analytics

Asset performance and automation

Process simplification and optimisation

People organisation of the future

Control tower, the central nerve centre for managerial decision making leveraging data

The system focuses on continual improvement aimed at optimising processes and eliminating non-value-adding efforts in production to reduce variability in process and product quality characteristics. Our QMS and procedures are in compliance with the regulatory requirements of the countries we operate in.

Our pharmacovigilance (PV) system monitors product safety in compliance with various regulatory requirements. Our PV standards are in line with globally recognised safety benchmarks such as the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines.

## GENDER DIVERSITY

To successfully develop and take our products and services to market, we depend on the expertise and specialist skills of a diverse, highly skilled workforce.

## Our aim is to create meaningful experiences that enable our colleagues to contribute to their full potential.

We believe that diversity across gender, ethnicity, race, and colour provides a variety of perspectives that strengthen the organisation. We have implemented several interventions such as hiring, sensitisation, communication, and policy revamp over the past year.

We have targeted interventions in place to increase the representation of women across roles and teams. These include scouting talent from other industries beyond the pharmaceutical industry and putting in place planned transition programmes for their immersion in our workforce. To make the workplace more inclusive, we are increasing the representation of women in non-traditional roles such as manufacturing and sales by providing realistic job previews, policy support, and gender sensitisation workshops on allyship.

GOAL

By 2035, gender parity across the organisation

## PROGRESS

There was an increase in women diversity by 1.25% in India, taking our diversity to 18% globally

GOAL

By 2030, atleast 35% women in senior leadership positions

## PROGRESS

Leadership teams now have a 16% representation of women, up from 12% in the previous year

## INCLUSION OF PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

## GOAL

By 2030, our workforce to include atleast 3% of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)

## PROGRESS

In FY2023, we increased the representation of People with Disabilities by 50% to reach 0.4% of our entire workforce

We are working towards creating a safe, inclusive and empowering work environment for our colleagues. As part of these efforts, we are focusing on hiring practices, sensitisation of recruitment teams, hiring managers, and colleagues on inclusive language and respect for personal space, accessible infrastructure in our buildings, and flexible working models. As we continue on the diversity, equity and inclusion journey, we believe that open and inclusive conversations are crucial. We encourage our differently-abled colleagues to speak up about any discriminatory experiences and to discuss their needs and requirements for an inclusive work environment.

During Disability Pride Month, we conducted workshops aimed at understanding and proactively addressing the needs of differently-abled persons. These workshops were conducted in collaboration with Dr. Reddy's Foundation (DRF) and aimed to encourage open and sensitive conversations while taking a people-first approach that looks at individuals in terms of their skills and strengths.

## Dr. Reddy's Foundation recognised for empowering persons with disabilities

The President of India recognised Dr. Reddy's Foundation for its efforts in empowering and creating employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities. The Foundation's multi-partner programmes, along with our policies and practices, demonstrate our commitment to creating a more inclusive and empathetic work environment and society.

## COMMUNITY HEALTH

We are working to improve the quality of primary care services in selected Primary Health Centres (PHCs), and state-owned rural and urban healthcare facilities that are essentially single-physician clinics. We partnered with the District Health and Medical Office to upgrade Patharapalli PHC in Srikakulam District, Andhra Pradesh which is now able to deliver quality services, particularly in outpatient care, diagnostics, emergency stabilisation, and referrals.

Our Community Health Initiative Programme (CHIP) aims to make healthcare accessible to communities, reduce maternal and neonatal mortality rates, increase health-seeking behaviours, and change community perceptions about health.

It also focuses on improving health knowledge by providing appropriate health information, addressing misconceptions, and reducing the fin ancial and disease burden on the community.

CHIP is implemented in partnership with NICE Foundation and currently operates in 155 villages in Andhra Pradesh.

In FY2023, as part of the universal health coverage CHIP provided doorstep services to 107 Scheduled Caste and Backward Class beneficiaries in Andhra Pradesh districts.

To support the rural healthcare system in India, CHIP worked with 7 PHCs as first referral units, 2 Community Health Centres (CHCs) as secondary referral units, and 2 district hospitals as tertiary units.

Along with the existing frontline workforce including Anganwadi workers, Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANM) and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs), CHIP nurses assist pregnant and lactating mothers and their babies to promote safe motherhood in underresourced communities. Through its comprehensive maternal child health intervention, CHIP provided antenatal, delivery, and postpartum services to 1395 registered women and 1085 newborns and facilitated nearly 1150 institutional deliveries. We also provided tailored home-based treatment to patients, including lactating mothers, newborns, aged patients, and those with severe mobility issues.

## IMPROVING FARMERS' LIVES

Through MITRA (Making Integrated Transformation through Resourceful Agriculture) programme, we have created a platform for lead farmers in villages to promote modern agriculture practices and better market connections with other farmers. In FY2023, we introduced newer technologies for farmers with pilot projects including one in collaboration with the International Potato Center. We supported over 1700 marginal farmers, mostly women, in setting up new cultivations. Through multiple interventions, we have helped farmers generate an additional income of ₹10,000 per acre in cereals.

The Farmer field school project in collaboration with Naandi Foundation provides training to small and marginal tribal farmers to help them adopt sustainable coffee and agroforestry farming practices. The approach used is participatory where farmers learn from each other through peer-to-peer learning on crop management, soil health, water management, pest control, and post-harvest practices. There was over double the growth in total coffee production, and 83% of the coffee harvested was of Grade I quality, indicating an improvement in the quality of production with these efforts.

A post-harvest analysis revealed that the average profits of farmers had doubled this year. We trained 8,334 farmers across 209 villages in FY2023.

## CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE

Through Action for Climate & Environment (ACE), we are implementing climate-smart and regenerative agriculture practices to improve farmers' income and reduce their GHG emissions and water footprints. Shifting from Transplanted Rice (TPR) to Direct Seeded Rice (DSR), adopting zero tillage farming in maize and wheat and optimisation of fertiliser usage based on the soil health parameters has potentially reduced carbon emissions by 1.0 to 1.3 tCo2e per acre, saving 500 to 1,800 kilolitres of water per acre depending upon the practices, and generate an additional income of ₹13,000 per acre for farmers.

In FY2023, the programme successfully shifted 70,335 acres from conventional tillage sowing to zero tillage in wheat and maize in Andhra Pradesh and Bihar. A total of 38,594 acres has been shifted from TPR to DSR in rice Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bihar.

## AGRI-WATER SAVING TECHNIQUES PROMOTED IN PADDY

In FY2023, Dr. Reddy's Foundation implemented agri-water-saving techniques in paddy fields in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. This initiative primarily focused on promoting Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) as an irrigation technique that involves applying water to the field after the disappearance of ponded water. This differs from the conventional irrigation approach of continuous flo oding, where the ponded water never disappears. 4.9 million kilolitres of water were conserved through this approach.

Dr. Reddy's Foundation continues to encourage sustainable agriculture practices and reduce the strain on freshwater resources in the region.

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, impacting health, natural habitats, livelihoods, ecosystems, and weather patterns. Our vision is to achieve carbon-neutral growth because we believe that business must coexist with the environment. The future belongs to those who can achieve this balance.

## CLIMATE RISK

We subscribe to the principles of Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework and recommendations. We have been taking enterprise-wide steps to respond to the climate risks and opportunities identified through the TCFD assessment in 2020, where we also identified major physical and transitional risks for our business and strategic supply chain. The analysis covered all our facilities and strategic suppliers and presented a scenario till 2039.

We have assessed the impact and likelihood of acute and chronic climate risks over a short, medium, and long-time frame. We identified potential adaptation and mitigation measures and estimated the financial implications of the identified risks and opportunities. We considered the results of the TCFD assessment while developing our carbon-neutral strategy. The Internal Carbon Price is applied to business decision-making and future investments in projects.

Our climate risk assessments of physical assets indicate that we have adequate resilient infrastructure and insurance provisions for facilities while we continue to work on further securing assets.

## PROGRESSING ON OUR CLIMATE ACTION PLAN

<!-- image -->

We remain committed to the energy transition and are on the pathway to carbon neutrality. The majority of our Scope 1 (direct) emissions originate from boilers used in operations for producing steam, electricity, and wastewater treatment facilities. Our Scope 2 (indirect) emissions are from purchased electricity for running facilities and operations. Our Scope 3 (indirect) emissions include emissions from purchased goods and services, capital goods, processing of sold products and others. Industrial processes generate significant amounts of SOx and NOx emissions as well as particulate matter that adversely affect local ecosystems, air quality, and habitats.

We are committed to preventing and mitigating air pollution by increasing the efficiency of operations and reducing emissions.

We adhere to emission norms and strictly control emissions within statutory limits. We strictly adhere to all relevant environmental laws, regulations, and guidelines in the markets where we operate. We have no pending environmental noncompliances in the reporting year.

<!-- image -->

Our strategy to achieve 100% renewable power by 2030 includes maximising the Capacity Utilisation Factor (CUF) of renewable power supplies, developing new projects through joint venture partners for long-term supply assurance, and switching from fossil sources to biomass in boilers and cogeneration plants. We are also developing alternate biomass fuel sources like rice husk and sawdust briquette, ensuring strategic forward contracts with biomass fuel suppliers to address supply chain issues, and adapting to the latest green technologies. We will continue investing in solar, hydel, and wind projects and accelerate our green transition by substantially increasing the share of renewable energy at all our facilities. Additionally, we are driving energy management, conservation, and efficiency projects to support our efforts to achieve our energy goals.

<!-- image -->

Our renewable power source mix comprises rooftop solar, joint venture for captive power, solar and hydel third-party power purchase agreements (PPAs), and *GDAM RECs (green day-ahead market Renewable Energy Certificates). During the year, a 690 KW rooftop solar plant was installed, 1.8 MW hydel power supply and 7.4 MW solar power supply started. With the above renewable capacity additions, the total rooftop capacity has become 6 MW, 59 MW third-party PPA's (solar and hydel), 7.7 MW Cogen plant on biomass fuel and 15 MW solar plants through JVC. Other projects we implemented include switching from furnace oil to natural gas-fired industrial boilers and installing biomass boilers. We used cogeneration with rice husk and multi-fuel at our API manufacturing plants which lead to a reduction of approximately 15,320 TPA of CO2 emissions from the boilers. We also implemented an operational excellence diagnostics programme to identify high-potential energy efficiency projects. Eight of our global formulations manufacturing sites are ISO 14001 certified.

*GDAM is green day-ahead market, a new market segment to trade the day-ahead contracts for renewable generation. RECs are issued when one megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity is generated and delivered to the electricity grid from a renewable energy resource. This supports the renewable energy market by providing a demand signal to the market, in turn encouraging the production of renewable energy to meet this demand.

## EFFICIENCY | PROTECTION | CONSERVATION

We saved approximately 37.64 million units during FY2023 and reduced ~40,000 tons of CO2 emissions. This year, 42% of our total electricity consumption was through renewable sources.

## With fuel change, energy efficiency, process optimisation and renewable power initiatives, we achieved 30% carbon neutrality during the year.

We developed an energy policy to optimise energy use throughout the Company. The policy sets guidelines for energy conservation and improving energy efficiency. It also encourages responsible energy purchase, use, and management through the business and value chain.

## Three facilities in Baddi operations achieved 100% renewable power

We are already consuming 17.425 million kilowatt hours (kWh) of clean energy in the Baddi cluster. While 86% of power is directly from renewable sources, we have procured 3.5 million Renewable Energy Certificates (*RECs, an accepted legal instrument for renewable energy generation and use) to convert the remaining 14% to renewable power and deliver the benefits of carbon mitigation within our operations. We now have four global facilities that are fully powered by renewable sources.

Our formulations manufacturing plant for regulated markets in Bachupally, Hyderabad, won the Platinum Award for Excellence in Energy Management by the Society of Energy Engineers and Managers (SEEM) India. The award recognises efforts in reducing power consumption, enhancing power efficiencies and promoting sustainable energy practices.

## Increasing adoption of green factory buildings in India

Our formulation manufacturing facility in Andhra Pradesh won the CII - Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) Green Champion Award 2022 in the category Pioneer in the large-scale adoption of green factory buildings in India. The efficiency measures and occupant-centric practices in our facilities have delivered significant tangible and intangible impacts on resource consumption and well-being.

We improved our performance and received an A- rating in our CDP Climate Response 2022 which is in the Leadership band, indicating we are implementing current best practices. We were named among Climate Leaders Asia-Pacific 2023 by Financial Times and Statista, featuring in a list of 275 Asia-Pacific companies that have achieved the greatest reduction in their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity and made further climate-related commitments.

## Biodiversity

We consider biodiversity conservation as a crucial component of sustainability and remain committed to protecting and conserving biodiversity in our manufacturing locations. Despite not operating in biodiversity-rich habitat areas with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list species or national conservation species, we remain mindful of projects that have a positive impact on biodiversity.

Since 2020, we have been supporting the ecosystem through multiple rainwater harvesting projects and creating increased biodiversity that supports water resources. During the year, we planted 32,003 saplings within and outside the fence with a carbon sequestration potential of ~800 tonnes per annum. We also planted 5,000 saplings at the Ramalayam Dulapally Reserve Forest in collaboration with the Forest Department of Telangana. We engaged with CII-ITC Centre Of Excellence For Sustainable Development to evaluate the biodiversity as well as natural carbon sequestration in our campuses at Bachupally, Pydibheemavaram, and Budhera.

## ADDRESSING WATER SECURITY

We require high-quality water for our production operations. We rely on various sources of water including surface, ground, municipal, and harvested rainwater. Availability of good quality water is critical for our business, and any disruption could have a severe impact on the supply of vital medications and society at large.

## We remain committed to water stewardship and developing a sustainable water supply system for our operations.

We are optimising freshwater use and improving water efficiency across operations while de-risking groundwater through multiple projects such as increased use of surface water and desalination plants. To manage wastewater and eliminate the risk of groundwater contamination, we have set up wastewater recycling plants and zero liquid discharge plants and ensure the safe disposal of the waste left over after treatment.

We intend to continue making more water available to our communities

## 10%

<!-- image -->

## Turning water-positive

In FY2023, we achieved our goal of turning into a waterpositive company. We attribute this achievement to our efforts towards water recharge, reuse, recycling, replenishment, and sustainable agriculture.

Our freshwater withdrawal was 1.83 million kilolitres, and we created a recharge potential of 6.07 million kilolitres of water. We achieved this through multiple interventions including building rainwater harvesting structures, community watershed programmes, pond rejuvenation, and sustainable agriculture efforts via our community-focused regenerative agriculture programme MITRA (Making Integrated Transformation through Resourceful Agriculture) and ACE (Action for Climate and Environment).

We will further improve this contribution with ongoing projects including rainwater harvesting, lake desilting, and wastewater management. We intend to continue making more water available to our communities, replenishing more water to the planet than we consume for our operations.

## EFFICIENCY | PROTECTION | CONSERVATION

## Water conservation and efficiency

We have installed equipment and designed processes to reduce water usage, along with developing a detailed waste process map that facilitates monitoring of reused and recycled water consumption. These efforts have helped to enhance water availability and decrease the dependence on freshwater and groundwater sources. Various initiatives have been implemented to promote water efficiency and sustainability, such as conducting Water Pinch Assessment, projects aimed at reducing freshwater intake, implementing rainwater harvesting systems for reuse and recharge within the premises, utilising greywater as a substitute for freshwater, and revitalising lakes and ponds. Additionally, we have also carried out community watershed programmes and sustainable agriculture initiatives beyond our premises.

In sites such as Hyderabad, Pydibheemavaram and Baddi, projects on rainwater harvesting, water pinch recommendations, and operational excellence projects helped reduce water consumption despite the rise in production year on year. Our engagement with the city water supply board helped achieve a 90% shift from groundwater to surface consumption in Hyderabad. The implementation of Catch the Rain 2.0 initiative and utilisation of treated grey water from beyond the fence have decreased our freshwater intake by 69,069 KL per annum.

Dr. Reddy's is a part of the UN Global Compact Network India's (GCNI) Water and WASH workstream, which is aligned with UN SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation.

As a part of our commitment to transparency and accountability, we respond to the CDP Water Security disclosure annually, comparing our efforts, performance, and progress to our water goals.

## WASTEWATER MANAGEMENT

We are committed to implementing sustainable water-management practices while complying with local regulations. We regularly measure and assess the risks and impacts of hazardous substances in wastewater at all of our sites. At our Zero-Liquid Discharge (ZLD) facilities, all the effluents generated are treated within the premises, and treated water is recycled and reused. We also co-process the final residue from the ZLD facilities. In FY2023, we saved 39,091 KL water from wastewater-focused initiatives.

At select API manufacturing sites, we implemented technologies such as Low Temperature Evaporator (LTE) to recover clean water from RO reject water, creating potential savings of ~₹20 million per year. A high-pressure RO system helped reduce the hydraulic load on Multi Effect Evaporator (MEE), reducing the need for approximately 2,625 KL of effluents, saving over ₹5 million in costs, and decreasing the overall carbon footprint of the ZLD facility. We are also working on ZLD enhancements such as steam strippers to efficiently remove organic contaminants from plant wastewater systems, Agitated Thin Film Dryer (ATFD) for drying concentrated effluents, and forced circulation evaporation systems to treat high volumes of wastewater that also reuse water and waste, and minimise energy consumption.

To further optimise processes, we automated sewage and effluent treatment plants' (STP and ETP) infrastructure through our Digital Paani initiative. Through a combination of sensors, automation, cloud-based software accessible anywhere, and 24/7 monitoring, we enable early detection of problems, facilitate advanced troubleshooting, monitor all the onsite work, provide technical guidance, and provide full visibility on operations for the team - anytime, anywhere, and from any device. This improves the reliability of operations, enables ease of operations, drives higher performance across the treatment process, and brings down long-term operating costs.

## PRODUCT SUSTAINABILITY

In FY2023, we worked on 16 products incorporating Green Chemistry principles that help make processes more sustainable. Process mass intensity helps us understand the impact that a synthetic route has on chemical resources, cost, and sustainability. All synthetic routes are evaluated for process mass intensity and minimising PMI is our key priority.

Along with green chemistry, we adopted life cycle thinking to assess our environmental impact in a more comprehensive manner. Our Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) programme helps us capture and analyse the environmental impact of our products and identify hotspots and improvement opportunities.

## Life Cycle Assessment

This year, we completed LCA studies of three API products by an independent external agency using professional software for LCA modelling. A *cradleto-gate assessment was done for Doxycycline Lactic Acid, Levetiracetam, and Atorvastatin. The assessment included the entire product lifecycle and emissions were included from raw material production (cradle) to the gate (until the stage at which the product is ready for use before it is transported). These studies were carried out based on ISO 14044:2006 guidelines.

ISO 14044:2006 Guidelines followed for Life Cycle

## Sustainable packaging

Our Sustainable Packaging Council (SPC) is responsible for reducing our environmental impact through redesigned packaging.

To improve the sustainability of our products, we reduced the amount of packaging used for products, including reducing the number of layers and the overall mass of packaging. We introduced recycled content where possible and ensured that all tertiary packaging materials used were recyclable or reusable. We also introduced renewable, biodegradable, and compostable materials where possible.

## Replacing plastic in product packaging

We replaced the PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) laminated cartons with FBB (Folding Box Board) cartons for Dologel-CT. The earlier PET laminated cartons were not only wasteful but also harmful to the environment due to the plastic film used for lamination. The FBB cartons are recyclable and have no plastic film. This helps in significantly reducing the amount of plastic used, with a lower carton weight of 300 GSM.

In FY2023, we implemented baling presses at select API manufacturing sites to reduce the volume of plastic packaging being sent outside for disposal. This initiative has decreased the quantity of plastic waste disposal resulting in a reduction in transportation costs and a decrease in Scope 3 emissions and is now being replicated across sites.

Products worked upon incorporating Green Chemistry principles that help making the process more sustainable

<!-- image -->

## WASTE MANAGEMENT

We place great emphasis on efficient waste management practices and are committed to ensuring that all types of waste are treated and disposed of properly, with plastic waste being either recycled or co-processed, depending on the type. E-waste is sold to authorised vendors, while hazardous waste is sent to cement industries and recyclers for co-processing and recycling, with only 1% sent to landfill. Non-hazardous waste such as glass, MS scrap, wood waste, and boiler ash is sent to recyclers, brick manufacturers, and cement industries for co-processing.

We comply with all applicable environmental regulations, and during the reporting year, there were no fines paid related to environmental issues. We have engaged a third-party service provider to collect the plastic waste that comprises non-recyclable multi-layered plastic (MLP) across different states of India, in compliance with the Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 and the requirements of Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) in India.

During FY2023, we collected and processed 1506 tonnes of plastic waste, which represents 100% of our post-consumer plastic waste that entered the Indian market.

## WORKING ON OUR SCOPE 3 EMISSIONS

Over 70% of our carbon footprint emerges out of the value chain. This includes all our global operations and business units, and 12 out of the 15 categories defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol are considered.

Through a detailed screening process based on the GHG Scope 3 methodology guidance, we find that a few categories are not as relevant and significant as the other categories. Categories 1 and 10 - purchased goods and services, and processing of sold products are the largest contributors to our overall emissions and we are focusing on multiple levers including engaging with strategic suppliers and developing our sustainable procurement strategy for raw materials such as APIs, excipients, chemicals etc. along with primary, secondary, and tertiary packaging, and a preference for local suppliers and materials.

As part of our carbon reduction roadmap to reduce Scope 3 carbon footprint, we are increasingly transitioning from air to sea transport where possible, improving packaging to optimise shipments, and urging suppliers to take action on decarbonising their operations.

This year, we expanded our GHG accounting boundary to include global operations and included four new categories. This has resulted in a significant increase in Scope 3 emissions for FY2023. We recalculated Scope 3 emissions for FY2022 to reflect our carbon footprint more accurately and provide a fair comparison of emissions. In FY2023, our total Scope 3 emissions amounted to 9,21,055 MTCO2e.

Emissions from supply chain emissions are complex to measure and track, particularly choosing emissions factors that are most representative of our footprint, and focusing on a consistent approach that will produce results with an adequate level of accuracy to drive action. We also see this representing a major opportunity for carbon assessment and reduction. We are working on developing an understanding of the full impact of Scope 3 emissions, and levers for reduction taking steps to ensure meaningful progress towards our goal.

GOAL

By 2030, 12.5% reduction in indirect carbon emissions across our supply chain (Scope 3)

PROGRESS

Revised Scope 3 inventory has been completed, and our emissions reduction plan is in progress

## BUSINESS ETHICS

Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applies to all the Directors and employees, our subsidiaries, and affiliates. It lays down the principles that guide our Company's conduct and decision-making, promoting stakeholder trust. The Code is in compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act, 2013, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and its implementing regulations.

We conduct our business in compliance with applicable laws and Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption policies. While contracts with contractors and business partners require adherence to our principles, there is a separate Code of Conduct that applies to suppliers and service providers. The Supplier Code of Conduct is modelled on the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative (PSCI), and 100% compliance with the code is required. The Global Marketing Code provides a minimum set of standards for interacting with healthcare professionals and institutions while engaging in sales, research, marketing, and promotion.

## We foster an environment of transparency and responsibility and encourage our employees and partners to speak up about any irregularities.

Reporting channels exist under the ombudsperson process, which includes an independent hotline, a web-based reporting site (drreddys.ethicspoint.com), and a dedicated email to reach the Chief Compliance Officer and also provide access to the Chairperson of the Audit Committee.

## Anti-trust and competition law

We respect and adhere to all national and regional competition and anti-trust laws. These laws aim to prevent businesses from engaging in any conduct that could harm market participants, ensuring a level playing field for all. Given the severe consequences, we expect all employees to adhere to competition and anti-trust laws and the guidelines outlined in our policy. In case any employee suspects a potential violation of competition and anti-trust laws, they are encouraged to report to the Chief Compliance Officer via complianceofficer@ drreddys.com or the Compliance Hotline number.

## Tax transparency

We uphold, endorse, and advocate the concept of transparency in all our business dealings, operations, and functions. We published our first Tax Transparency Report in FY2023, detailing our tax strategy and tax affairs. The report elaborates on the effectiveness of the tax principles we have adopted, along with our focus on governance and accountability towards the local governments in the countries of our operations.

## Human rights

<!-- image -->

We are committed to upholding human rights across the value chain and are guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International Labour Organization conventions, and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. This policy is implemented through a due diligence process that identifies and mitigates potential risks related to child labour, forced labour, discrimination, harassment,

collective bargaining, and freedom of association. All business decisions are required to comply with our human rights standards, and we assess and adopt local legislation and cultural nuances of the regions we expand into. Regular reviews of potential human rights risks are conducted as part of the due diligence process, and mitigation plans are accordingly mapped and implemented.

## GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL

We are committed to aligning with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights by continuously identifying and mitigating risks for employees, women, children, migrant workers, third-party contract labour, indigenous people, local communities, and strategic suppliers. With the SA8000 standard and other internal protocols, we evaluate the human rights risks associated with our facilities.

A comprehensive Social Accountability Management Procedure (SAMP) has been developed for facilities in line with the SA8000 standard, through which we conduct external assessments by a thirdparty for suppliers, which includes key indicators such as ethics, labour welfare, health and safety, and management systems. We provide a safe working environment for all and encourage employees to report any unsafe conditions. All applicable local and global laws related to wages, work hours, overtime, and employee benefits in countries of operation are adhered to.

To know more about grievances recorded and addressed in FY2023, please refer

## Responsible product use

We educate Clinical Pharmacies (CPs) on responsible product usage through regular promotional and non-promotional meetings. Our products come with detailed leaflets offering information on safe usage and disposal. Through labelling, we promote transparency in disclosing productrelated risks, helping customers make informed decisions.

## Bioethics and Animal testing

The laboratory animal facilities at Aurigene Pharmaceutical Services Limited (APSL) and Biologics have been registered with the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision on Experiments on Animals (CCSEA), the statutory agency monitoring animal experimentation in India. The number of animals used for experimentation is reduced through appropriate study design. Wherever appropriate and possible, animal studies are replaced by in-vitro studies. As an alternative to the animal research work, most of the in-vitro pharmacodynamic activities for biosimilars (Tocilizumab, Vedolizumab, Abatacept) are performed using in vitro models such as cell lines and recombinant receptors (target binding and subsequent functional effects).

Wherever possible, animal studies are replaced by invitro studies

<!-- image -->

We fully comply with the 3R principles (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement) in laboratory animal testing and ensure the rehabilitation of large animals maintained at the animal facility as per CCSEA guidelines.

Both facilities have an Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC), the animal research review committee, approved by CCSEA to review and approve animal testing protocols and to oversee the animal care and use programme. Prior to an animal testing project, the investigator of animal experiments considers whether the aim of the project could be realised by using in-vitro techniques or experiments involving animal species of lower phylogenetic order. All IAEC members review animal research protocols and seek justification from the principal investigator on the number of animals proposed to be used, the animal model proposed in the application and any alternative methods by which the study objectives may be achieved. In all animal ethics committee meetings, facility veterinarian(s) discuss to understand the animal care and use compliance. The APSL animal facility is fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC) International, USA since June 2021.

## Information security and data privacy

We certify our IT infrastructure and information security management system across sites and conduct third-party vulnerability analysis, including simulated hacker attacks. All our employees go through a thorough security induction upon joining. Awareness campaigns are conducted periodically and address potential security risks and threats on several topics such as phishing and hacking, including elements of the Code of Business Ethics, and these are followed by on-the-spot training. Employees are encouraged to report incidents to a 24x7 managed mailbox, and we recognise those who contribute to enhancing our security provisions on a regular basis.

As of FY2023, there were no instances of data breaches, customer privacy issues, or loss of customer data.

## RISK MANAGEMENT

The Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) function focuses on identifying key business, operational, and strategic risks through quarterly assurance meetings, structured interviews, on-call discussions, and incident reviews. Risks are categorised into risk groups and aggregated at different levels of the organisation. Our ERM function operates with the objective of proactively identifying and increasing awareness about the various risks among the appropriate stakeholders, facilitating discussions on prioritising and mitigating identified risks, developing systems to alert when risk tolerance limits are exceeded, establishing a framework to assess risk tolerance and analysing remaining risks.

The Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) oversees our compliance processes, while the Chief Internal Auditor helps to enhance and protect organisational value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice, and insight. The Chief Risk Officer leads the risk function.

## BUILDING A RESILIENT VALUE CHAIN

## Identifying and engaging our strategic suppliers

We are working to build an ESG-compliant supplier base across categories and aim to partner more extensively with our suppliers to help them deliver measurable improvements and significant impacts over the next several years.

We identified 90 strategic suppliers based on the following selection criteria on which suppliers had greater strategic value:

1

<!-- image -->

Suppliers contributing to the procurement spend equivalent to 60% or more

Suppliers of materials that have a single supplier/source with no substitution

Any other critical supplier not falling under the above parameters

All our suppliers have signed the Supplier Code of Conduct (SCOC), and we have been training suppliers to adhere to the SCOC. Our code is modelled on the PSCI Principles for Responsible Supply Chain Management (The Principles). We use PSCI's audit template as a basis for auditing our suppliers' performance, with Dun & Bradstreet as assessment partners.

We are working with strategic suppliers on an ESG capabilitybuilding programme and sustainable procurement processes and conducting an onsite assessment as per our ESG framework. Based on the results of the evaluation, we will identify potential high-risk suppliers and develop a mitigation plan based on the strategic suppliers' risk classification.

We were rated A- and featured on the CDP Supplier Engagement Leaderboard 2022 for the second consecutive year, recognising our efforts to measure and reduce climate risk within the supply chain.

## PROGRESS

Capability building has been completed for 100% of our strategic suppliers. Supplier audits to assess compliance based on our ESG framework are in progress

## GOAL

By 2030, ensure 100% strategic suppliers are compliant with our chosen ESG framework

## Shipment optimisation

We observed that sea containers being shipped on our major traffic lanes were not fully utilised in terms of volumetric capacity. We conducted a diagnostic study for containers shipped on each of these lanes and current palletisation mechanisms. We came up with several solutions including sea container height and volume utilisation and pallet-space utilisation.

This resulted in a lower number of containers shipped on these lanes and trucked in ground transportation. Our overall carbon emissions on these routes (road and sea) were reduced by 165 MT per annum.

FY2023 was a good year with strong performance across multiple parameters. Despite an intensely competitive environment, we saw robust top-line growth and an increase in core operating profit through our new launches and growth in existing categories. Like many other businesses, we had to navigate the challenges of operating in a volatile macroeconomic environment. We experienced an increase in costs due to inflation, including higher shipping, utilities, and employee benefits costs, and volatility in the forex market. However, thanks to operating efficiencies, we were able to absorb these increases, minimise their overall impact and demonstrate the strength and resilience of our underlying businesses.

During the year, we focused on driving growth and profitability through a pragmatic mix of organic and inorganic initiatives. We strengthened our portfolio by acquiring select brands and further consolidated our business through the divestment of non-core brands. We are making good progress in digitalisation, in line with our aspiration to become one of the most efficient pharmaceutical operations in the world. Our largest manufacturing facility in Bachupally, Hyderabad, joined the Global Lighthouse Network of the World Economic Forum. The successful inclusion of our 25-yearold site as a 'Digital Lighthouse' factory is a big milestone in our productivity improvement journey.

Recognising the importance of emerging trends in the pharma sector, we are excited and committed to progress on our journey in two horizons. Horizon 1 continues our emphasis on 'Growing the Core'; while Horizon 2 focuses on 'Building the Future'. In other words, Horizon 2 prioritises beyond the core. It includes scaling up some of our existing businesses as well as venturing into new spaces.

## Improvements in revenue and EBITDA in FY2023 were mainly due to the following factors:

- 1. Sustained performance in the generics markets with key new product launches: We witnessed decent growth in the US and Europe, which was driven by high value new product launches and base business traction, despite this growth being constrained by price erosion and increased competition in some of our products.

## 2. Divestment of non-core brands and strategic acquisitions: To

- grow our core businesses and growth brands, we made the strategic acquisition of Cidmus to strengthen our presence in chronic space in India. Simultaneously, we divested certain non-core brands in the dermatology, paediatric, gynaecology, and urology segments. Further, to enhance our portfolio in our chosen growth markets, we acquired the US generic prescription product portfolio of Mayne Pharma; and some key branded and generic injectable products from Eton Pharma.

## 3. Productivity improvement

- measures: As earlier, across all our businesses, we continued on our journey to trim costs through improved productivity and eliminate waste while creating a more efficient structure. Initiatives undertaken to drive cost efficiencies and productivity improvement across manufacturing, procurement, and R&D spending played a significant part in improving the financial performance of our Company. While focusing on productivity, we made significant investments to build people and digital capabilities, brands, and product pipelines and, thus keep our future growth strategy in mind.

## A snapshot of performance

## Global Generics (GG)

- · Revenue from GG in FY2023 was C 213.8 billion, or a growth of 19% compared to the previous year. This was driven by strong performances witnessed in North America, India, and the European markets.
- · Revenue from North America Generics (NAG) was C 101.7 billion, translating to an impressive growth of 36% over FY2022. This growth was supported by the launch of 25 new products during the year. Of these, the major new launches were Lenalidomide capsules, Sorafenib, and Pemetrexed Injection. It should be noted that a healthy growth in the sales volumes of our existing products was partly offset by pricing pressures on some of our key products, such as Icosapent Ethyl Capsules and Vasopressin.

In FY2023, our Company filed 12 new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). As of March 31, 2023, we had 86 generic filings pending approval from the US FDA. These comprise 81 ANDAs and five New Drug Applications (NDAs) filed under the Section 505(b)(2) route of the US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Of the 86 ANDAs, 45 are Para IV applications, and we believe that 18 of these have the 'First to File' status.

Launched Lenalidomide in the US during the year

<!-- image -->

- · Revenue from Europe was C 17.6 billion, or a growth of 6% compared to FY2022. This was primarily due to the expansion of the base business across our European markets and new product launches, but it was partially offset by pricing pressures on some of our products.
- · Revenue from Emerging Markets was C 45.5 billion, which remained fla t compared to FY2022 due to the high base effect of COVID-19related products. Growth due to new product launches and forex benefits was offset by a reduction in base business volumes.
- -Revenue from Russia was C 21.2 billion, or an annual yearon-year growth of 2%.
- -Revenue from other CIS countries and Romania was C 8.6 billion, with an annual growth of 4%.
- -Revenue from Rest of the World (RoW) territories was C 15.7 billion, with an annual decline of 5%.

<!-- image -->

- · Revenue from India was C 48.9 billion, which represented a growth of 17% compared to FY2022. This was attributable to an increase in the prices of our existing products, along with additional revenues from the launch of new products. During FY2023, we launched nine new brands in India. The growth was also aided by the divestment of a few non-core brands during the year.

## Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI)

Revenues from PSAI stood at C29.1 billion, which represents a decline of 5% as compared to FY2022. This was mainly on account of the base effect of the COVID-19-related portfolio being partially offset by forex benefit. During the year, we filed 134 Drug Master Files (DMFs) worldwide, including 12 filings in the US.

## Global pharmaceutical market outlook

In the last few years, the pharma sector has been sailing steadily despite the uncertainties and turbulence caused by COVID-19. With advances in information and research, the outlook for the sector is getting clearer with more predictable challenges ahead. The health systems have responded well by developing vaccines with significant efficacy,

safety, and speed. However, with the inconsistent use of vaccines and therapeutics, the next few years are not without uncertainties, especially with the periodic emergence of infection and viral variants.

At the same time, research has been ongoing to improve the understanding of the long-term complications and the presence of post-acute sequels of COVID-19. Considering this, it is believed that COVID-19 will still be a major driver for global medicine spending in the coming years. Global spending on COVID-19 is expected to touch around $500 billion in the seven years leading to 2027.

Another major uncertainty will be the potential impact of economic factors on countries' policies and budgeting. Global economic activity is experiencing a sharper-than-expected slowdown. COVID-19, followed by geopolitical tensions, weighs heavily on the outlook, which depends on how government regulators across the world calibrate their monetary and fiscal policies.

According to IQVIA's recent report on medicine usage, excluding COVID-19, the global medicine market is expected to grow at 3% to 6% CAGR through 2027,

reaching about $1.9 trillion. The highest volume growth over the next five years is expected in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, India, and Africa/Middle East, largely driven by population growth. Growth in developed countries will be led by innovative medicines, which should offset losses due to patent expiries and loss of exclusivities. (Refer Table 1)

Oncology, the leading therapy area in terms of global spending, is forecasted to grow at higher than earlier predicted rates, with an estimated growth of 13% to 16% CAGR as it faces limited losses of exclusivity in the coming years.

Another key growth area for medicines is biotech, which is estimated to represent 35% of global spending in the nex t fiv e years.

## Oncology is forecasted to grow at 13-16% CAGR

## Region-wise outlook

<!-- image -->

## US

Spending in the US is expected to grow between (1%) and 2% annually over the next five years. During this period, more than 250 new active substances are expected to be launched in the US, which will increase spending on new brands. However, this growth is estimated to be offset by higher losses of exclusivity in both small molecules and biologic products. Furthermore, the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act, with one of its priorities to reduce healthcare costs through price negotiations and cost caps, is expected to significantly increase the pressure on medicine pricing and cost-sharing among stakeholders.

## Europe

Europe's biosimilar market is the largest in the world. It is expected to grow due to the loss of exclusivity in Europe set to triple over the next five years, and more than half of this impact is expected to be from biologics. The losses are expected to be offset by new launches, mainly from oncology, neurology, and rare diseases.

## China

China, the world's secondlargest country in terms of healthcare spending, continues to focus on its Healthy China 2030 policy by expanding access to novel drugs via the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL). In recent years, with zero tolerance pandemic policies, China's spending pattern on healthcare has been fluctuating heavily. In the next five years, however, spending is estimated to grow in the range of 2% to 5% annually.

## India

Considered one of the highgrowth markets, spending in India is expected to grow, boosted by volumes, at around 8% to 10% per annum up to 2027. With the COVID-19 pandemic and the more recent Russia-Ukraine conflict impacting supply chains across industries, many multinational pharma corporations are looking at India as an alternative to China.

## Increased commitment towards environmental, social, and governance (ESG)

The impact of health disparities due to COVID-19, increasing human rights issues, greater scrutiny on governance, and the looming global climate crisis have amplified the importance of ESG. Investors are demanding stronger action from companies on adopting responsible business practices, fighting climate change, and demonstrating how they are building resilient businesses. Businesses today have realised that ESG is not just a social license to operate, but a powerful medium to communicate how a company creates long-term value for its stakeholders. It has a significant positive impact on fundamental business issues relevant to the long-term success of any company, fast becoming a measure of business sustainability. ESG is helping create both financial and non-financial value by providing opportunities for market differentiation, operational efficiency, talent retention, access to new revenue streams, and improve d fin ancial performance.

The years ahead will be crucial for the pharma industry where we might witness significant changes across all areas of pharma-from clinical trials, drug discovery and development, digitisation, and innovative treatment models to new people-centric approaches. Some key trends that may emerge over the next few years are given below.

- · Economic Uncertainty: Geopolitical shocks will continue to overshadow the world economy. Despite some recent improvements, the outlook remains fragile and downside risks

<!-- image -->

predominate. Concerns about fin ancial vulnerabilities have risen, including in financial institutions, housing markets, and low-income countries. While headline inflation has started declining, it remains elevated and could persist longer. The re-opening in China is also expected to have a positive impact on global activity, reducing supply chain pressures. However, sensitive to macro-economic conditions, a compounding impact on multiple activities is likely on everything from R&D and manufacturing costs to drug prices and access to medicines.

- · Personalised medicine: The field of personalised medicine, which arose from the concept of the customisation of therapeutics, holds the potential for boosting the future of healthcare. From a 'one-size -fit s-all' approach to graded and outcome-based targeted therapies, the sector is making greater investments in precision medicine, thanks to advances in technology around genomics. Recent developments in digitalisation have opened possibilities for R&D procedures in personalised medicine to be much more advanced. The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by the industry will mature, and going forward, the development of new therapies and drugs can be bolstered by active advances via AI.
- · Medical devices facilitating preventive healthcare: In line with an uptick in personalised medicine, the preventive medicine market is expected to pick up pace. This area deals with the prevention of a certain disease instead of its treatment, as it anticipates, and hence, helps prevent the disease. Wearable medical devices make it possible to monitor and share vital health information, such as blood pressure, glucose levels etc. to medical practitioners on a real-time basis, thus facilitating early detection and attention.

·

Partnerships and collaborations:

- Traditionally, the life sciences industry was siloed, with different functions such as R&D, manufacturing, and sales operating in isolation from each other. This has changed remarkably over the last few years and will do so at a faster pace in the future. New forms of collaboration will be witnessed in the pharmaceutical industry to provide stronger accessibility and new healthcare delivery models to patients. Public-private partnerships, associations with other research, and academic institutions will pave the way for the industry.
- · Digital healthcare delivery: The spectrum of patient care has widened and is no longer limited exclusively to hospitals and doctors' clinics. The healthcare industry is becoming increasingly verticalised; ie organisations at different levels of the supply chain are creating alliances to enhance delivery. In this, digital health has emerged as a powerful opportunity to deliver care to individuals and positively impact the health of communities. 'Digital health' describes healthcare that is enabled or accessed by information technology. This includes modalities like video or virtual visits and rapid and informal communication through electronic messaging.
- · Ageing population and lifestyle changes: Ageing populations, particularly an increase in life expectancies, are resulting in a rise in chronic illness. Lifestyle changes are also triggering an increase in diseases. Malnutrition, unhealthy diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, and stress, among others, are the presentations of an unhealthy lifestyle. These are putting further pressure on healthcare resources.
- · Greater use of natural language processing tools: Increasing numbers of companies are tapping into the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools to gain insights from troves of

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

unstructured data. These tools then transform all such information into structured formats where it can be rapidly identified and analysed at each phase of the safety life cycle. NLP will be critical in enabling researchers and data scientists to garner information at a scale that will help provide an increasingly large treasure trove of medical intelligence to further spark pharmaceutical innovations.

- · Climate change: The effects of climate change will be widereaching and shall impact multiple industries. Healthcare is no exception to that. Rising temperatures will likely accelerate the spread of tropical diseases, while waterborne illnesses may become more common with increased rain and storm surges contributing to flooding. Just as in the wake of COVID-19, the pharmaceutical industry may come under increasing pressure to fulfil its public health needs.
- · Policy changes altering pricing and reimbursements: Everchanging government policies on drug approvals and drug pricing have long-lasting outcomes. For instance, in the US, the Inflation Reduction Act reflects an ongoing trend towards rewiring global

supply chains to be more resilient to geopolitical challenges and natural disasters. Considering the impacts of COVID-19, it will be interesting to see how different countries' regulators try to pass reforms in shaping the future of the healthcare industry.

Disruptive technologies and emerging trends such as robotics, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, precision medicine, or patient design will impact the manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceuticals. The industry will have to embrace new technologies and put a greater focus on prevention and digital health.

## Dr. Reddy's market performance, FY2023

## North America Generics (NAG)

NAG is Dr. Reddy's largest market and has crossed the $1 billion revenue mark for the second consecutive year. In FY2023, it contributed to around 48% of our Company's GG sales and 41% of overall sales.

Revenue from the region for FY2023 was C 101.7 billion ($1.2 billion), representing an impressive growth of 36% over the previous year. FY2023 saw the successful launch and commercialisation of Lenalidomide in the US, contributing

significantly to the growth. Like previous years, FY2023 also witnessed high price erosion due to increased competition across some of our key products. However, this impact was offset by an increase in volumes for some of our base products and contribution from new product launches-the most important ones being Lenalidomide capsules, Sorafenib, and Pemetrexed Injection. Growth was further aided by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Indian rupee. Some key developments were:

- · Filed 12 new ANDAs, comprise some complex products and across different dosage forms.
- · Acquired the US generic prescription product portfolio of Australia-based Mayne Pharma Group Limited.
- · Acquired a portfolio of branded and generic hospital injectable products from Deer Park, Illinois-based Eton Pharmaceuticals.
- · Launched Lenalidomide Capsules (a cancer drug used to treat myeloma) in the US with two of six strengths eligible for first-to-market, 180-day exclusivity.
- · Launched Sorafenib tablets, a drug used to treat a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.

<!-- image -->

- · Launched Timolol gel, an ophthalmic gel forming solution used to treat glaucoma.
- · Gained a market share in certain key products, such as Isotretinoin and Sumatriptan injection.

Our current priority includes accelerating the development and launch of new products that are difficult to make and increasing the market share of existing products through both traditional marketing and digital channels. The strategy is to significantly expand our portfolio and ensure the right cost structures for our products to be able to compete sustainably in this highly competitive market.

We will continue to focus on complex formulations, primarily injectable and oral solid dosage forms, as well as OTC brands in the medium term while focusing on biosimilars, differentiated formulations, and other Horizon 2 businesses in the longer term.

## E 101.7 bn

Revenue from NAG for FY2023

## Europe

Revenue from Europe in FY2023 was C 17.6 billion, representing a growth of 6% over the previous year. The increase in revenues was propelled by high volume growth and new product launches across our major markets, which was partially offset by price erosion in some of our products.

Currently, Europe comprises 8% of our global generics sales. In the medium to long term, we expect it to grow by leveraging our in-house portfolio of generics and biosimilars, seeking inlicensing opportunities, entering and scaling up business in new markets, and exploring new business opportunities in the future growth segments through Horizon 2 businesses.

<!-- image -->

Revenue from Europe for FY2023

## Emerging Markets

Revenue from Emerging Markets for FY2023 was C45.5 billion and remaine d fla t compared to the previous year. Revenues were supported by new product launches across markets and beneficial forex rates; however, growth was impacted by a higher base in FY2022 owing to revenues from COVID-19 products and the divestment of a few of our non-core brands.

Revenue from Russia for FY2023 was C 21.2 billion, representing an increase of 2% over the previous year. However, in terms of local currency (ruble), there was a decline of 9% over the previous year. This was largely attributable to the divestment of a few non-core brands during the previous year.

## E 45.5 bn

Revenue from Emerging Markets for FY2023

Revenue from CIS countries and Romania was C 8.6 billion, representing 4% growth over the previous year. The growth was led by the increase in prices of certain products partly offset by the decrease in base business volumes.

Revenue from our Rest of the World markets (which includes Brazil, China, South Africa, Australia, and certain other markets) was C 15.7 billion, representing a decline of 5% over the previous year. This was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from COVID-19-related products in FY2023. This was offset by the growth in base business mainly in China, Columbia, Algeria, and Brazil.

Our focus is to improve the market share in the chosen therapy areas through growth in the existing products as well as new product launches.

Our strategy for Emerging Markets is to build a healthy portfolio pipeline, including differentiated and oncology products, coupled with the expansion of biosimilars. We will focus on further scaling up in our major markets, which include Russia, China, Brazil, and South Africa while opening new geographies by leveraging our in-house portfolio of

<!-- image -->

generics and biosimilars and seeking inlicensing opportunities.

## India

Revenue from India in FY2023 was C 48.9 billion, or a growth of 17% compared to the previous year. The growth was aided by the divestment ( ' 4.9 billion) of a few non-core brands during the year. According to IQVIA in its report for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2023, our growth has been 2.5%. Our market rank was 10th as per Moving annual total (MAT) March 2023 in terms of sales value. Our growth in this market has been due to improved prices and revenues from the launch of new products including the Cidmus brand acquired during the year. Growth was also aided by the revenues from the divestment of a few non-core brands during the year.

During the year, we launched nine brands in India, including Cidmus and PrimcyV. Sixteen of our brands-Voveran, Omez, Cidmus, Atarax, Econorm, Omez-D, Practin, Zedex, Ketorol, BroZedex, Razo-D, Stamlo, Tryptomer, Mintop, Clamp, and Nise-are among the top 300 brands of the Indian pharmaceuticals market.

In the near term, we will continue to drive productivity improvement and focus on our core therapeutic areas and big brands. In the medium to long term, our strategy is to build a healthy pipeline of differentiated products in relevant therapies including biosimilars, expand our presence in areas such as OTC and nutraceuticals, and explore future growth businesses through our Horizon 2 focus.

## E 48.9 bn

Revenue from India for FY2023

## PSAI

The PSAI business recorded revenues of C 29.1 billion in FY2023, a decline of 5% compared to the previous year. This was primarily due to a reduction in volumes of COVID-19-related products. In FY2023, we filed 134 DMFs globally, of which 12 were in the US.

<!-- image -->

The PSAI segment primarily consists of our business of manufacturing and marketing active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as 'APIs', which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. APIs become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption, such as a tablet, capsule, or liquid, using additional inactive ingredients. We also serve our customers with incremental value-added products including semi-finished and fin ished formulations. This segment also includes our contract research services business and our manufacture and sale of APIs and steroids in accordance with specific customer requirements.

Our strategy of building a sustainable and growing business involves new product launches and the ramping up of base businesses in key geographies. We will continue to leverage our relationships with key customers by supplying materials that have value addition instead of being 'plain vanilla' APIs. We aim to be a partner of choice for global pharmaceutical companies and achieve global leadership through costs and service.

## Revenue

Total revenue grew by 15% to C 245,879 million in FY2023. This was primarily due to the contribution of new product launches across our businesses and growth in existing and new categories, partially offset by price erosion in our GG segment's North America (the US and Canada), Europe, and certain other emerging markets. The growth was also aided by revenues from the divestment of a few of our non-core brands in India, while the revenue in the previous year was boosted by COVID-19-related product sales and the divestment of noncore brands largely in Russia and India.

## Gross profit

Gross profit increased by 22% to C 139,343 million in FY2023. This led to a gross profit margin of 56.7% in FY2023, representing an increase of 360 basis points compared to the previous year. The gross profit margin for GG was 62.1%. This increase was on account of new product sales of certain products with higher gross margins, higher government incentives, and favourable foreign exchange. The increase was partly offset by the price erosion in some of the products, primarily in the US and Europe. For the PSAI business, the gross profit margin was 16.2%. PSAI's gross profit margin decreased primarily on account of a higher percentage of manufacturing overhead costs on a lower sales base and the price erosion in some of the products.

Gross profit margin of 56.7% in FY2023, representing an increase of 360 basis points compared to the previous year.

## Net finance income

The net finance income was C 2,853 million in FY2023 versus C 2,119 million in FY2022.

## Net profit

Net profit increased by 91% to C 45,067 million in FY2023. This represents a PAT margin of 18.3% of revenues versus 11.0% in FY2022. In FY2023, the effective tax rate was lower compared to FY2022 largely due to changes in our Company's jurisdictional mix of earnings.

## Liquidity and capital resources

The data are given in Tables 4 and 5. Cash generated from operating activities in FY2023 was C 58,875 million. Investing activities net outflow amounting to C (41,373) million in FY2023 includes net investment in property, plant, equipment, and intangibles to build capacity and capabilities for future business growth. Cash outflow from financing activities was C 26,861 million. Closing cash and cash equivalents on March 31, 2023, was C 5,779 million.

## Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses

SG&A expenses increased by 10% to C68,026 million in FY2023. This was largely attributable to an increase in personnel costs primarily on account of annual increments, rupee depreciation, and increased headcount; higher investments towards brand building and marketing activities; and an increase in travel and vehicle expenses, which were lower last year due to COVID-19. It should be noted that SG&A accounted for 27.7% of sales in FY2023, representing a decline of 130 basis points compared to last year.

## R&D expenses

R&D expenses for FY2023 were C19,381 million, or 7.9% of revenue, versus 8.2% in FY2022. The R&D spending in FY2023 increased by 11% over FY2022 due to an increase in the development activities relating to our biosimilars and an increase in the number of high-value product pipelines.

## Impairment of non-current assets

In FY2023, there has been an impairment charge of C699 million. This mainly pertains to a decrease in the market potential of the medical cannabisbased business acquired from Nimbus Health GmbH and an impairment of the company's product-related intangibles due to adverse market conditions.

## Net other income

The net other income was C5,907 million in FY2023 versus C2,761 million in FY2022. The net other income was higher primarily on account of the recognition of an income of C5,638 million from a settlement agreement with Indivior Inc, Indivior UK Limited, and Aquestive Therapeutics Inc, resolving all claims between the parties relating to the generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg dosages.

## Enterprise-wide risk management (ERM)

## Our ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- · Proactively identify and highlight risks to relevant stakeholders;
- · Facilitate discussions around risk prioritisation and mitigation;
- · Provide a framework to assess appetite;
- · Develop systems to warn when the appetite is being breached; and
- · Provide an analysis of residual risk.

The ERM team connects with our business units and functions, which are the primary sources for risk identification. It also monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers in the industry. The team collaborates with quality assurance, compliance, information security, safety, HR, internal audit, and other assurance teams to identify and mitigate the risks of business units, including risks relating to cyber security and the environment.

Our ERM function focuses on the identification of key sectoral, business, operational and strategic risks. These are carried out through quarterly assurance meetings, structured interviews, on-call discussions, and reviews of incidents.

Risks are aggregated at the unit, function, and organisation levels and are categorised by risk groups. Our response framework categorises these risks into (i) internal (preventable), (ii) internal (strategic), and (iii) external risks. The integrated assurance forum and the executive risk management committee are management-level committees that help the ERM function to prioritise organisation-wide risks and steer mitigation efforts in line with our risk appetite.

Mitigation work carried out by the ERM team is regularly reviewed, and the progress of key risks is discussed with the Executive Risk Management Committee and senior management, as well as at the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.

<!-- image -->

These include (i) updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks and (ii) specific risk-related initiatives carried out during the year.

During FY2023, risk mitigation efforts included the review of risks and mitigations related to cyber security, data privacy, ethics and compliance risk, quality, supply chain management, geopolitical risks and business continuity, foreign exchange risk, pharmacovigilance, and environmental risk (with a focus on water risk).

## ESG

In 2022, we made ESG central to our purpose and business strategy and announced our ESG vision for 2030 to maximise positive social impact. We set up a strong governance structure through a Board-level committee on sustainability to provide ESG guidance, formed a sustainability council chaired by leadership to drive the progress on our ESG goals, and nominated ESG champions across our Company to advance our sustainability agenda. We continue to embed and integrate sustainability into our decision-making and strategy, defining key performance indicators to evaluate our performance and setting up targets and tangible actions with defined timelines to measure our progress. ESG is integrated into our overall ERM programme, identifying ESG-related risks, evaluating likely impact scenarios and risk exposure, and developing mitigation plans to better manage these risks. To better report on the linkages between our strategy,

<!-- image -->

governance, and financial performance in an ESG context, we produced ou r fir st integrated report in FY2023. To read more about our detailed ESG performance and initiatives, please refer to page 38 of our integrated report and page 114 for our Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report.

In 2022, we made ESG central to our purpose and business strategy and announced our ESG vision for 2030 to maximise positive social impact.

## Human Resources (HR)

In FY2023, the focus has been on improving people productivity across the organisation, for which we leveraged automation and digitalisation of processes leading to reduced human intervention. We are working to develop autonomous work areas and lighthouse factories of the future by building appropriate capabilities in the organisation. We are closely tracking per-person productivity metrics across business units, and personalised learning

journeys are being undertaken to cover business-critical skill gaps through certifications of our employees to ensure better delivery of business.

We have sought to unlock productivity by leveraging the new-age tool, Digital Ninja - our flagship digital capabilitybuilding programme. Launched earlier, it had over 36,000-course completions on LinkedIn. We have succeeded in developing over 2,850 new Digital Ninjas in the organisation. To embed the Dr. Reddy's way of execution excellence, the simplified SDP way of governance continues to be followed across the organisation while focusing on lean daily management and reducing the number of reviews across levels. Kaizen optimiser continues to be leveraged as a digital tool for the same purpose.

For a winning product strategy, we have carried out appropriate staffing of the central portfolio organisation and product strategy dissemination to the relevant populations across the different business units. To effectively execute a winning product strategy, we have covered over 90% of our target population via six training modules through the Specialisation2Commercialisation initiative. To bring necessary focus to Products That Matter (PTM), 100% staffing of PTM projects is being ensured.

We continue to take proactive steps to retain the right talent and ensure continuity of delivery. Some interventions that have helped us are predictive analytics, which focuses on hotspots of attrition and the profiling of talent that must stay and managers that we should retain. We are also incentivising lateral moves, and ring-fencing key talent through market benchmarking and structured communication and engagement with employees. We have been able to retain critical talent to ensure business continuity and support our growth agenda.

To facilitate growth opportunities for employees through lateral movements and cross-BU movements and to create a well-rounded talent pool with strong succession benches, we launched the fir st-ever career development week at Dr. Reddy's - called Propel - in October 2022. We also launched the Propel platform, which works as an internal talent marketplace, connecting employees to new opportunities and hiring managers to the best-fit talent across the organisation. It should promote new ways of working with short-term projects and gigs and create a ready pool of internal talent to take on various business critical projects in the future. AI-based skill matching is

expected to help employees understand their fit for a particular role even before applying.

With eased restrictions after COVID-19, we revamped ways of working in the organisation along the lines of Future of Work. This centralised induction programme includes both 'in-person' and 'digital' components to move away from the remote approach adopted during the COVID-19 outbreak. This 'Phygital' induction model allows all nonHyderabad-based recruits a seamless and virtual induction experience while catering to the preferences of most Hyderabad-based joiners to avail the benefits of an 'in-person' experience.

Several developmental journeys have been launched for top teams across the organisation. These involve a combination of forum, coaching, and systemic levers; and bring about multiple benefits - the most important being (a) coherent teams with improved ways of working and (b) a renewed 'set-up' that brings about a common definition of outcomes.

To strengthen the culture of aspirational thinking in the organisation, Moonshot Goals have been introduced this year in the performance enablement process

<!-- image -->

to help set ambitious targets. A matrix manager (dotted line reporting) feature was also enabled to ensure that we accurately reflect the reality of our organisation and the cross-functional work that our colleagues undertake across geographies and BUs.

To create a workplace where employees can unleash their full potential, we have launched employee experience journeys across the organisation. As a step to enhance employee experience, we are attempting to make it connected, efficient, and joyful across all touchpoints, impacting employees' work every day.

We have revamped our recognition platform, 'Spark'. It is now based on a simplified recognition framework linked to ASPIRE and strategic moves linked to the scorecard. This has made on-thespot recognition easier for managers and enabled peer-to-peer recognition through e-cards that can be posted on the platform. The process of creating a culture of recognition will be an ongoing one with a focus on communication with employees, inducting new employees, and educating first-time managers.

We continue to focus on holistic well-being at the organisation level through workshops, daily wellness sessions covering meditation, yoga, and pranayama, and platforms to allow employees access to counselling for their mental well-being. We are strengthening our focus on condition management through the MyHealth Index (MHI), which tracks the health parameters of employees who are enrolled on a yearlong journey of health improvement. MHI is currently operating for around 8,100 employees in FTO 2 and 3, FTO HO, FTO 7 and 9, Biologics, and IPDO.

Taking forward our agenda of increasing diversity representation and developing an inclusive culture in the organisation, our focus has been on dedicated diversity hiring in entry-level roles and regularly connecting with women to address their challenges. We have raised the representation of women in leadership roles to 16%. Our efforts in increasing the diversity in the salesforce are focused on three pillars: care, career,

<!-- image -->

and connection. We have worked on providing hygiene kits, increasing out-station allowance, arranging boot camps for campus hires in sales roles, and establishing regular connects to proactively address the challenges.

Taking into view other areas of workforce diversity, structured workshops on working with differently-abled people were also conducted to sensitise over 70 people managers and enable them to take a 'people-first' approach that looks at all employees in terms of skills and strengths. We also organised a workshop on recruiting differently-abled people for HRBPs and the talent acquisition team, where we identified 10 roles across BUs for hiring differently-abled. In February 2023, we conducted three LGBTQIA+ related sensitisation sessions for 150 employees and contract staff and onboarded two transgender women in our organisation.

We kicked off our annual flagship event Celebration of Excellence on October 12, 2022. This culminated in the Excellence Awards in January 2023. The theme of the celebrations was 'Excel in Horizon 1, Build Horizon 2'. The celebrations cut across hierarchy and geography, covered all sites and locations and touched some 15,000 employees. Various activities like quizzes, sports, musical performances, talent hunts, alumni meets, and employee stories on living the purpose were carried on for three months of fun, collaboration, and camaraderie.

In FY2023, the focus has been on improving people productivity across the organisation, for which we leveraged automation and digitalisation of processes leading to reduced human intervention.

## Digital transformation

Digital transformation has sped up, and we are using it to unlock the potential of data. We are also innovating our processes with the use of new technologies. You can refer to the initiatives that we have undertaken in more detail on pages 44 and 45 of this report.

## Outlook

FY2023 has been a good year in terms of financial and operational performance across the various businesses. We have a strong foundation, and our diversified geographical presence allows us to suitably respond to opportunities and threats while delivering long-term value for our stakeholders.

We have a strategy that will drive growth and, most importantly, one that should keep increasing access to medicines for people who need these the most. While we continue our focus on our core (Horizon 1) businesses, we are reasonably optimistic that our Horizon 2 initiatives will help improve the lives of patients by addressing unmet and unarticulated needs through affordable and innovative solutions.

We have shown excellent financial discipline with a strong balance sheet and robust cash generation in FY2023. While the strong balance sheet provide s fin ancial flexibility to support future growth, we will follow a disciplined approach to cash management and acquisitions. We will continue to bolster operating efficiency, drive productivity, improve operations and processes to increase efficiency and responsiveness, enhance quality systems, strengthen our R&D, and invest in digital initiatives to get closer to customers. We maintain our unwavering commitment to quality and to building a portfolio that anticipates future health needs.

For appointment of an Independent Director, the independence criteria defined in Section 149(6) of the Act, and Regulation 16(1)(b) of the SEBI Listing Regulations are also considered.

In accordance with Section 178(3) of the Act, Regulation 19(4) of the SEBI Listing Regulations and on recommendation of the Company's Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board adopted a Remuneration Policy for Directors, KMP, senior management and other employees that outlines the guidelines related to performance evaluation of Directors, remuneration principles and Board diversity. The Policy forms part of the chapter on Corporate Governance .

Our executive compensation program supports attracting, motivating, and encouraging continuity of experienced and well-qualified executive officers who advance our critical business objectives and promote the creation of shareholders' value over the long-term. The key tenets of our philosophy are designed to:

- a) Attract highly talented individuals from within and across industries drawing from a diverse pool of global talent.
- b) Provide long term and short-term incentives that advance the interests of shareholders and deliver levels of pay commensurate with performance.

The three principal components of the compensation package include, base salary, annual variable pay, and equitybased long-term incentives. In making decisions with respect to each element of compensation, the competitive market for executives and compensation levels

provided by comparable companies are considered.

Pay practices at companies with which Dr. Reddy's competes for talent, including those engaged in similar activities are reviewed from time to time.

We believe that information regarding pay practices at other companies is useful to assess the reasonableness and competitiveness of our own. Our approach is to be market aware on pay levels and not entirely market driven.

We generally position target executive pay at the top quartile of pay packages for executives in similar positions, responsibilities and/or experience in similar companies of comparable size.

We identify certain roles that are fungible across multiple industries and our comparative pool may not be limited to peer generic pharmaceutical organisations. In such cases - a wider sample is selected comprising of non-pharma marquee organisations operating in the country with whom Dr. Reddy's competes for talent.

Executive compensation is reviewed annually. In general executive increment percentages are lesser than the average with the frontline receiving the highest increase. A higher increase may be made in the event of a role change, promotion, or in exceptional circumstances. The Company's performance, affordability and individual performance are other considerations, while deciding on compensation.

Our current performance management follows a balanced scorecard approach comprising of current business performance, future business performance, ESG, digital, people, compliance and safety related metrics.

Each parameter is devised into a metric , fin ancial or otherwise and is measured throughout the performance year. Non -fin ancial parameters have a cap of 100% achievement while financial parameters are scored based on a predetermined grid. Additional considerations such as wind-falls, impairments and one-offs are measured separately.

Our performance management process is specifically adapted to different employee cohorts based on their specific

needs, the overall principles remain the same across all the models.

Performance evaluation of Management Council ("MC") member's focuses on achievement of MC Scorecard. Individual MC evaluation focusses on achievement of:

- · the BU (Business Unit) scorecard for the year that contributes to the delivery of the overall Company's strategy.
- · demonstration of desired behaviours which measures the commitment to sustainable growth by focussing on performance on non-financial parameters centered around the Company's leadership behaviours. Also considered is the contribution of the individual to the wider enterprise agenda.

- · With above renewable power additions, we have reduced ~17,954 tons of Scope-2 CO2 emissions during FY 23.
- · We have converted 7.7 MW Cogeneration plant from coal to biomass fuel in CTO-6 and which will result in avoiding around ~ 1,77,737 tons of Scope-1 CO2 emissions per year.
- · We have also commissioned two new 5 TPH biomass fired boilers at FTO-11 and FTO PU-1 plants respectively.

## (III) THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT ON ENERGY CONSERVATION EQUIPMENT'S & PROJECTS:

- · During the year, the Company has implemented energy conservation projects across its various business units and accrued savings of approximately C 386 million against an investment of C 440 million.
- · With the above energy saving projects implementation, we have reduced ~40,000 tons of CO2 emissions during the year.
- · Additional C 518.2 million is being spent for the energy conservation and emission reduction projects including 13.6 MW renewable power through a hybrid project of wind and solar through ISTS, 3 MW hydel project to become captive consumer and biomass fired boilers at FTO 6&8 and FTO 7&9 plants.

- heat recovery unit where the second stage heat will be used for heat pump application at FTO2 plant.
- · AHU having electrical heater are replaced with steam supply to control RH and reduce the power consumption in FTO PU-1.
- · Old ACs replaced with energy efficient Inverter ACs in FTO-2.
- · Reduced power consumption by installing auto On/Off switch with temperature controller for cooling towers in CTO-2.
- · Optimized compressed air pressure, arresting air leakages & reduction of the loading hours of air compressor units.
- · Interconnected PB-15 and PB-16 200 TR chiller and cooling tower with existing equipment and facilities to reduce the power consumption in CTO-6.
- · Optimization of power consumption by installing high capacity RT pumps at M block cooling tower and stopped existing three small capacity pumps in CTO-5.
- · I-Block & SRS Block cooling towers interconnected and stopped "I" block cooling tower. Installation of new 3 TPH boiler in FTO-2 having higher efficiency - 87% to reduce the fuel consumption.
- · Installed alternative 33KV stand by HT Line for CTO-5 from discom substation to improve power supply redundancy and reduce the running hours of DG set during power failure.
- · Apart from above major ideas, almost 250 energy conservation ideas were implemented.

## (II) STEPS TAKEN BY THE COMPANY FOR UTILIZING ALTERNATE SOURCES OF ENERGY

IF SO, PROVIDE DETAILS OF INSTANCES AS TO HOW THE INPUTS RECEIVED FROM STAKEHOLDERS ON THESE TOPICS WERE INCORPORATED INTO POLICIES AND ACTIVITIES OF THE ENTITY

Effective engagement helps us connect stakeholder needs with organizational goals, creates the basis of an effective strategy development, and unlocks greater shared value for all stakeholders. We use multiple platforms to engage with a wide variety of stakeholders to understand their unique needs and concerns and chart out suitable strategies to address them. We also conducted a materiality assessment that involved an intensive stakeholder engagement round. Our internal and external stakeholders identified key material topics that are likely to impact Dr. Reddy's business, like product availability, responsible pricing and affordability, high-quality medicines, patient safety, anti-bribery and corruption. These topics have been considered in the list of Dr. Reddy's action areas and our sustainability framework.

- 8. BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE WASTE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ADOPTED IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENTS. DESCRIBE THE STRATEGY ADOPTED BY YOUR COMPANY TO REDUCE USAGE OF HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC CHEMICALS IN YOUR PRODUCTS AND PROCESSES AND THE PRACTICES ADOPTED TO MANAGE SUCH WASTES

We have waste management systems in place at all our facilities. Plastic waste is either co-processed or recycled based upon the type of waste generated. E-waste is sold to authorized vendors. 99% of our global hazardous waste is sent to cement industries and recyclers for co-processing and recycling. The remaining 1% of global hazardous waste is sent to landfill.

Other non-hazardous waste such as glass, MS scrap, wood waste, boiler ash etc. is sent to recyclers, cement industries for co-processing or to brick manufacturers.

We reduce waste through technological interventions and ongoing initiatives including sustainable packaging, waste source segregation, process optimization etc. For example, we have replaced plastic boxes with paper boxes for commercialized products (Practin tablets), removed triple laminated films and LDPE bags from primary packaging (Ibandronate tablets).

## 8. DISCLOSE ANY SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE ENVIRONMENT, ARISING FROM THE VALUE CHAIN OF THE ENTITY. WHAT MITIGATION OR ADAPTATION MEASURES HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY THE ENTITY IN THIS REGARD

There is no significant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain partners. 100% of our critical and strategic suppliers have valid air, water & waste consent. 66% of our strategic partner's are also certified under ISO 14001 Environmental Management System.

However, we also measure our Scope 3 emissions to address the emission hotspots in the value chain. To address the reduction in carbon footprint we have driven major projects around:

- · Air to sea Shipment: 85% transition from air to sea shipment was observed.
- · Truck Loadability: With appropriate planning and management, we have optimized the utilization of trucks resulting in a reduction of trips and overall carbon footprint.
- · We encourage dedicated transporters to shift to CNG vehicles from diesel.
- · We drive supplier engagement programs to help them opt for projects resulting in reduction of Carbon footprint.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

Based on recommendations of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee ("NGCC"), the Board considers the appointment and re-appointment of Directors.

Section 149(10) of the Act, provides that an independent director shall hold office up to five consecutive years on the Board of a company from the date of appointment and shall be eligible for re-appointment for a second term of up to five consecutive years on passing of a special resolution by the members. Moreover, independent directors cannot retire by rotation. Further, Regulation 25(2A) of the SEBI Listing Regulations, provides that appointment, re-appointment or removal of an independent director of a listed entity, shall be subject to the approval of shareholders by way of a special resolution.

During FY2023, the members of the Company approved the appointment of Mr. Arun M Kumar (DIN: 09665138) as an Independent Director of the Company in terms of Section 149 of the Act and applicable provisions of the SEBI Listing Regulations through Postal Ballot process, with effect from August 1, 2022.

Section 152 of the Act, states that onethird of the Board members, other than independent directors, who are subject to retire by rotation, shall retire at every Annual General Meeting ("AGM") and be eligible for re-appointment, if approved by the members. During FY2023, Mr. K Satish Reddy (DIN: 00129701), who retired by rotation, was re-appointed at the 38th AGM under Section 152 of the Act. Mr. K Satish Reddy was also re-appointed as a Whole-time Director, designated as Chairman, for a period of five years with effect from October 1, 2022.

Mr. G V Prasad (DIN: 00057433) retires by rotation at the forthcoming AGM and being eligible, seeks re-appointment. Therefore, at the forthcoming AGM, approval of members is being sought for re-appointment of Mr. G V Prasad, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for re-appointment, as Director, designated as Co-Chairman and Managing Director of the Company.

## BOARD PROCEDURE

SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the Board is the responsibility of the NGCC of the Board, which consists entirely of Independent Directors. Given the existing composition of the Board, the years left of the existing members to serve on the Board, and the need for new domain expertise the NGCC evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board as well as description of the role and capabilities required of a Director on the Board. When such a need becomes apparent, the NGCC reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings. It then places its recommendation of the shortlisted candidate(s) to the Board for its consideration. If the Board approves, the person is appointed as an Additional Director. Thereafter, the approval of members is sought in terms of the provisions of the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations.

## INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

The Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations, inter alia, define an 'independent director' as a person who, including his/ her relatives, is or was not a promoter or employee or key managerial personnel of the company or its subsidiaries. Further, the person and his/ her relatives

should not have a material pecuniary relationship or transactions with the Company or its subsidiaries, during the three immediate preceding financial years or during the current financial year, apart from receiving remuneration as an independent director. There are various other conditions prescribed for independent directors under the provisions of the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations.

We abide by these definitions of Independent Director, in addition to the definition of an Independent Director as laid down in the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") Listed Company Manual and other provisions by virtue of our listing on the NYSE in the US.

Based on the disclosures received from all Independent Directors, the Board has formed an opinion that the Independent Directors fulfill the conditions specified in the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations, and are independent of the Management.

As on March 31, 2023, the Company has 7 Non-Executive Independent Directors (including 3 Women Directors) which comprise 78% of the total strength of the Board of Directors. The maximum tenure of the Independent Directors is in accordance with the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations. The NGCC identifies candidates based on certain criteria laid down and takes into consideration the need for diversity of the Board which, inter alia, includes skills, knowledge, gender and experience and accordingly makes its recommendations to the Board.

## MEETINGS OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

Schedule IV of the Act and Regulation 25 of the SEBI Listing Regulations mandate that the independent directors of the Company shall hold at least one meeting in a year, without the attendance of non-

<!-- image -->

independent directors and members of the management. To exercise free and fair judgment in all matters related to the functioning of the Company as well as the Board, it is important for the Independent Directors to have meetings without the presence of the executive management.

During FY2023, our Independent Directors met four times in sessions without the presence of Executive Directors and other members of the Management. The Company is ready to facilitate more such sessions as and when required by the Independent Directors. During these meetings, the Independent Directors reviewed the performance of the Company and of the Chairman, Co-chairman and Managing Director, its Senior Management and the Board. Corporate strategy, risks, competition, succession planning for the Board and Senior Management and the quality of information given to the Board were also discussed.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

All the Independent Directors of the Company have been appointed as per the provisions of the Act and the SEBI Listing Regulations, and formal letter of appointment are issued to the Independent Directors. As required by Regulation 46 of the SEBI Listing Regulations, the terms and conditions of their appointment have been disclosed on the website of the Company at https://www.drreddys.com/ investor#governance#policies-anddocuments

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarise a new Independent Director with the Company, an induction kit containing documents about the Company is provided. It contains, inter alia, information such as its Annual Reports, Sustainability Reports, Investor Presentations, recent Press Releases, Research Reports, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBE) and the Memorandum and Articles of Association and a brief on Company's Board

with effect from close of business hours on October 28, 2022, on completion of his term as an Independent Director. The Board placed on record its sincere appreciation for their valuable contribution made by them as the Independent Director of the Company as well as the Chairmanship/ membership of the various Board Committees.

Mr. Allan Oberman, resigned from the position of the Independent Director of the Company with effect from close of business hours on January 6, 2023, as he was moving to a commitment outside the Company that will not allow him to be able to devote sufficient time for his responsibilities as an Independent Director of the Company. Mr. Allan in his resignation letter confirmed that there were no other material reasons for his resignation before the expiry of his current tenure. The Board has placed on record its sincere appreciation for his valuable contribution as a Board member.

## LEAD INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

Mr. Prasad R Menon's term as an Independent Director (Lead Independent Director) of the Company was ended on October 29, 2022. Consequently, the Board has appointed Ms. Kalpana Morparia, Independent Director of the Company, as the Lead Independent Director, with effect from October 30, 2022. The role of the Lead Independent Director includes presiding over all meetings of Independent Directors, provide objective feedback of the independent directors as a group to the Board on various matters, liaise between the Promoters, Chairman/ Co-Chairman, CEO and Independent Directors on contentious matters for consensus building, assist in further strengthening the Board effectiveness and governance practices, including suggestions on agenda items for Board/ Committee meetings on behalf of the Independent Directors, among others.

## BOARD EVALUATION

One of the key functions of the Board and the NGCC is to monitor and review the Board evaluation framework. The Board works with the NGCC to lay

practices. The new Independent Director individually meets with Board members and Senior Management. Visits to plants and research locations are organised for the Director to understand the Company's operations.

We believe that the Board should be continuously empowered with knowledge of latest developments affecting the Company and the industry. Apart from regular presentations on the Company's business strategies and associated risks, expositions are made on various topics covering the pharmaceutical industry.

Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial pronouncements around industry related laws are regularly circulated to the Directors. They also visit the Company's manufacturing and research locations. Each Director has complete access to any of the Company's information and full freedom to interact with the Senior Management.

Details of the familiarisation programs for Independent Directors are available on the Company's website: https://drreddys. com/cms/sites/default/files/2023-06/ Familiarization%20programs%202023. pdf

## LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

An internal management committee approves all capex investments within the annual capex budget approved by the Board. An update on key capex approvals (and their relevant details) granted by the internal management committee is generally provided to the Board.

## COMPLIANCE REVIEWS

We have a Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and a full-fledged compliance team to oversee compliance activities.

When pertinent, these are also shared with all Board members.

## STATUTORY COMPLIANCE MONITORING TOOL

The Company has in place a webbased Statutory Compliance Monitoring Tool which has been implemented to streamline and manage compliance tracking of all the statutory & legal compliances needed to be followed by the Company and provides the necessary assurance to the Board.

## COBE AND VIGIL MECHANISM

We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics ("COBE" or the "Code"), which applies to all Directors and employees of the Company, its subsidiaries and affiliates. It is the responsibility of all Directors and employees to familiarise themselves with this Code and comply with its standards. The Directors and the employees across the Company annually affirm compliance with the Code. A declaration of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company to this effect is enclosed as Exhibit 7 to this chapter.

The Company has an Ombudsperson Policy (Whistle-Blower or Vigil Mechanism) to report concerns on actual or suspected violations of the Code. The Audit Committee Chairperson is the Chief Ombudsperson. Concerns raised to the Company and their resolution are reported through the Chief Ombudsperson to the Audit Committee and where applicable, to the Board. During FY2023, no personnel has been denied access to the Audit Committee on ombudsperson issues.

The COBE and Ombudsperson Policy are available on the Company's website: https://www.drreddys.com/investors/ governance/code-of-businessconductand-ethics-cobe/#governance#codeof-business-conduct-and-ethics and https://www.drreddys.com/

## CONFLICT OF INTEREST

The Company has a Conflict of Interest Policy which lays down the principles and standards that govern the actions of the Company including its subsidiaries, joint ventures and its Directors, officers and employees (full time or part time, contract employees and consultants). This Policy provides guidance for recognising, reporting and resolution of any actual, potential or perceived conflict of interest.

Further, as part of the Governance ecosystem, the Company has adopted best practices on reviews of conflict of interest of Directors. The Directors' disclosures are placed before the Board and conflict of interest, if any, are discussed and reviewed by the Board. The Board collectively is responsible for decision making on conflict of interest disclosed to the Board for any business decisions, wherein any of the Directors are interested.

## RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We have adequate procedures to identify and monitor related party transactions. All transactions with related parties are placed before the Audit Committee and the Board for review and approval, as appropriate. Transactions entered into with related parties during the financial year were on arm's length pricing basis and in the ordinary course of business. The details of related party transactions are discussed in note 2.24 to the standalone financial statements.

## PROHIBITION OF INSIDER TRADING

We have a policy prohibiting insider trading in conformity with applicable regulations of the SEBI in India and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the USA. Necessary procedures have been laid down for Directors, officers, designated persons and their immediate relatives for trading in the securities of the Company. These are periodically communicated to such employees who are considered as insiders of the Company. Apart from this, regular insider trading awareness sessions are conducted for the benefit of designated persons. Trading window closure/ blackouts/ quiet periods, when the Directors and designated persons/ insiders are not permitted to trade in the securities of the Company, are intimated in advance to all concerned. Violations of the policy, if any, are appropriately acted on and reported to the SEBI/ Stock Exchanges. The Company also maintains a Structured Digital Database, as required under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015.

## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND STATUTORY AUDITS

We have both external and internal audit systems in place. Auditors have access to records and information of the Company. The Board and the Audit Committee recognises the work of the auditors as an independent check on the information received from the management on the operations and performance of the Company. The Board and the Audit Committee periodically reviews the findings and recommendations of the Statutory Auditors and Internal Auditors and suggests corrective actions, whenever necessary.

## INTERNAL CONTROLS

We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:

- · Organisation's strategic objective;

- · Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
- · Adequacy of safeguards for assets;
- · Reliability of financial and non -fin ancial reporting; and
- · Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The integrity and reliability of our internal control systems are achieved through clear policies and procedures, process automation, training and development of employees and an organisation structure that segregates responsibilities.

Our internal audit team is an independent assurance and advisory function, responsible for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. The internal audit team helps to enhance and protect organisational value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice and insight. The internal audit team prepares annual audit plans based on risk assessment and conducts extensive reviews covering financial, operational and compliance controls. Areas requiring specialised knowledge are reviewed in partnership with external experts or by recruiting resources with specialised skills. Suggested improvements in processes are identified during reviews and communicated to the management on an ongoing basis.

The Audit Committee of the Board monitors the performance of the internal audit team on a periodic basis through review of audit plans, audit findings and speed of issue resolution through follow ups. Each year, there are at least four meetings in which the Audit Committee reviews internal audit findings. During the year, the Audit Committee Chairman also met the Chief Internal Auditor without the presence of management.

## CEO AND CFO CERTIFICATION

A certificate of the Chief Executive Officer as well as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company on financial statements and applicable internal controls as stipulated under Regulation 17(8) of the SEBI Listing Regulations is enclosed as Exhibit 8 to this chapter.

## STATUTORY AND IFRS AUDITORS

For FY2023 M/s. S.R. Batliboi & Associates LLP, Chartered Accountants (Firm registration no. 101049W/ E300004), the Statutory Auditors, audited the financial statements prepared in accordance with the Ind AS. During the year, the Company reappointed M/s. Ernst & Young Associates LLP, as an independent registered public accounting firm (Independent Auditor) to audit the annual consolidated financial statements and for issuing an opinion on the financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standard Board (IASB) for FY2023.

The Statutory and Independent Auditors render an opinion regarding the fair presentation in the financial statements of the Company's financial condition and operating results. Their audits are conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards and include a review of the internal controls, to the extent necessary, to determine the audit procedures required to support their opinion.

While auditing the operations of the Company, the external auditors recorded their observations and findings with the management. These were then discussed by the management and the auditors at the Audit Committee meetings, either face-to-face or via conference calls. Remedial measures suggested by the auditors and the Audit Committee have been either implemented or taken up for implementation by management.

The Statutory and Independent Auditors provide a confirmation of their independence every financial year. They confirm that the engagement team, involved in the audit of the Company and its group including network firms have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence.

They also confirm that on the basis of procedures implemented within their practice, they have not identified any situation or risk likely to affect their independence as Company's auditors for the financial year within the terms of the rules of conduct applicable in India.

It also discussed the results of their examination, their evaluation of the Company's internal controls, and overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee provides at each of its meetings an opportunity for internal and external auditors to meet with the members of the Audit Committee, without presence of the management. The Audit Committee also annually reviews the auditors' independence and performance, and effectiveness of audit process.

- g) Approvals for Related party transactions and review thereof, as applicable;
- h) The financial statements of the subsidiaries including the investments and significant transactions;
- i) Ombudsperson process/ complaints, remuneration of Chief Compliance Officer (CCO) and insider trading compliances;
- j) Sections of the Annual Report including Management Discussion and Analysis, and Directors' Responsibility Statement

The Audit Committee ensures that the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has a mechanism such that no person intending to make a complaint relating to securities and financial reporting shall be denied access to the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee, inter alia, has recommended to the Board of Directors:

- a) That the amount of audit fees be paid to the Statutory Auditors and Independent Auditors;
- b) That the audited standalone and consolidated financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited for the year ended March 31, 2023, prepared as per Ind AS to be approved by the Board as a true and fair statement of the financial status of the Company; and

$^{1}$The Company has since attended all the shareholders' requests and queries which were pending as on March 31, 2023. The above table does not include shareholders' disputes, which are pending in various courts.

## DISCLOSURE ON LEGAL PROCEEDINGS PERTAINING TO SHARES

There are three pending cases relating to disputes over title of the shares of the Company, in which the Company has been made a party. These cases, however, are not material in nature.

## NATIONAL ELECTRONIC CLEARING SERVICE (NECS) FACILITY FOR REMITTANCE OF DIVIDEND ELECTRONICALLY

The Company provides the facility for remittance of dividend to shareholders through NECS. Under this facility, shareholders can receive dividend electronically by way of direct credit to their bank account. With this service, problems such as loss of dividend warrants during postal transit/fraudulent encashment etc. can be avoided. This

also expedites the credit of dividend directly to the shareholder's account as compared to the payment through physical dividend warrant. Shareholders are advised to refer to the Investor Handbook on the Company's website, www.drreddys.com, for further details on this facility.

## TRANSFER TO INVESTOR EDUCATION AND PROTECTION FUND (IEPF)

## UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS

Pursuant to Section 125 of the Act, unclaimed dividend for FY2015 amounting to C 9.05 million, has been transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) of the Government.

The dividend amounts for FY2016 which have been unclaimed for seven years will be transferred to IEPF. Shareholders who

have not claimed the dividend(s) amount are, therefore, requested to do so before they are statutorily transferred to the IEPF during FY2024. Table 13 gives the transfer dates in this regard.

The shareholders who have not cashed their dividend are requested to immediately approach Company's RTA, for making payment through electronic bank transfer. In cases, where bank details for making electronic payment are not available, or electronic payment instructions have failed or rejected by the bank, duplicate warrant(s)/ demand draft(s) may be issued in lieu of the original warrant(s)/ demand draft(s).

The information on unclaimed dividend/ interest is available on the Company's website: www.drreddys.com.

## TRANSFER OF UNDERLYING SHARES TO INVESTOR EDUCATION AND PROTECTION FUND (IEPF)

Pursuant to Section 124(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 read with Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (Accounting, Audit, Transfer and Refund) Rules, 2016, as amended, all shares in respect of which dividend has not been paid or claimed for seven consecutive years or more shall be transferred to IEPF.

During the year, the Company has transferred (transmitted) 3,867 equity shares held under 97 folios to the IEPF, on which dividend has not been paid or claimed for seven consecutive years to IEPF. Before such transfer of shares to IEPF, the Company has sent individual notices at the latest available addresses of the shareholders, whose dividends are lying unpaid/unclaimed for FY2015 along with subsequent seven consecutive years' dividend, advising them to claim the dividends and also published a notice in newspapers inviting the shareholders' attention to this matter.

The Company has sent reminder at latest available addresses of the shareholders, whose dividends are lying unpaid/unclaimed, advising them to claim the dividends for FY2016 and subsequent years.

Shareholders who have not claimed/ encashed their dividends from FY2016 can write to the Company's RTA or at the registered office of the Company, for making a valid claim for the unclaimed dividends. If the shareholders do not claim the unpaid or unclaimed dividends for FY2016 and seven consecutive years before August 30, 2023, then the shares held by them with respect to such dividend are liable to be transferred to IEPF.

## CLAIM FROM IEPF AUTHORITY

Members/Claimants whose shares and dividends have been transferred to the IEPF authority can claim the same by making an application to the IEPF authority by filing Form IEPF-5 (available at www.iepf.gov.in) and sending duly signed physical copy of the same to the Company at its Registered Office along

with requisite documents as prescribed in the instruction kit of e-Form IEPF-5. No claims shall lie against the Company in respect of the dividends/shares so transferred.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

To the Members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

Report on the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements

## OPINION

We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the Balance sheet as at 31 March 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss, including the statement of Other Comprehensive Income, the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the standalon e fin ancial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2023, its profit including other comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone financial statements.

## KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalon e fin ancial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone financial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(i) of the significant accounting policies, and note 2.30 (A) containing details of contingencies in the standalone financial statements)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case- to-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the difficulty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the standalone financial statements.

Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at different levels in the Company, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.
- · We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Company's in-house legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We compared the evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the standalone financial statements. We tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- · We obtained legal letters from the Company's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate, we examined correspondences connected with the cases.
- · We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities.
- · We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of material tax positions and assessed the technical merits based on the correspondence and assessments from the relevant tax authorities.
- · We also evaluated the disclosures made in the standalone financial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Returns, discounts and other deductions in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(m) of the significant accounting policies of standalone financial statements and note 2.13 of the standalone financial statements)

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for sales returns and discounts etc. The estimates relating to these accruals are important given the significance of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes.
- · We also tested management's controls over the methods for making estimates, data and assumptions of the estimates used to calculate the sales deductions.
- · We tested management's estimated sales deductions and obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates. We tested management's estimates over the determination of sales deductions. accruals by comparing the rates used in management's estimate to rates in the underlying contracts and historical sales deductions data.
- · We compared the assumptions to contracted prices and discounts, allowances and returns, as applicable to current payment trends.
- · We also considered the historical accuracy of the management's estimates in prior years and assessed the estimated amounts, we evaluated trends in actual sales and discount accrual balances.
- · We also tested the underlying data used in management's calculations for accuracy and completeness and verified source data supporting the historical sales and sales returns levels and volume discounts settled during the period.
- · We tested recording of revenue in appropriate period which included the following procedures:
- · Performed trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous periods;
- · Verified sample sales transactions near period-end.

## OTHER INFORMATION

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Statutory reports, Management discussion and analysis, corporate governance and Board's report included in the Annual report, which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report, and Corporate Overview and letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman included in the Annual report, which is expected to be made available to us after that date. The other information does not include the standalone financial statements and our auditor's report thereon.

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the standalone financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether such other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## RESPONSIBILITIES OF MANAGEMENT AND THOSE CHARGED WITH GOVERNANCE FOR THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the standalone financial statements, management and the board of directors are responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process.

## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalon e fin ancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMTED

## REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3 OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 ("THE ACT")

We have audited the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories ("the Company") as of 31 March 2023 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS

The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI"). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone fin ancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, as specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to these standalone financial statements.

## MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO THESE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fin ancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

## INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control with reference to standalone financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## OPINION

In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to standalone financial statements were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

## 1.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## a) Statement of compliance

These financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 March 2023 comply in all material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, and as amended from time to time together with the comparative period data as at and for the year ended 31 March 2022.

These financial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective or elected for early adoption at the Company's annual reporting date, 31 March 2023. These financial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on 10 May 2023.

## b) Basis of measurement

These financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

- · derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;
- · financial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the classification;
- · employee defined benefit assets/(liabilities) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan

assets, adjusted for actuarial gains/(losses) and the present value of the defined benefit obligation;

- · long-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method;
- · share-based payments are measured at fair value;
- · assets held for sale are measured at fair value;
- · assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations are measured at fair value;
- · Contingent consideration arising out of business combination are measured at fair value; and
- · right-of-use the assets are recognised at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at that date. This amount is adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs, incurred, if any.

## c) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes:

- · Note 1.3 (b) - Assessment of functional currency;
- · Note 1.3 (c) - Financial instruments;
- · Note 1.3 (d) - Business combinations and goodwill;
- · Notes 1.3 (e) and 1.3 (f) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- · Notes 1.3(g) - Determination of cost for right-of-use assets and lease term;
- · Note 1.3 (h) - Valuation of inventories;
- · Note 1.3 (i) - Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;
- · Note 1.3 (j) - Assets and obligations relating to employee benefits;
- · Note 1.3 (k) - Share-based payments;
- · Note 1.3 (l) - Provisions and other accruals;

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

- · Note 1.3 (m) -Measurement of transaction price in a revenue transaction;

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

- · Note 1.3 (p) - Evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and estimation of income tax payable and income tax expense in relation to uncertain tax positions; and
- · Note 1.3 (l) - Contingencies

## d) Current and non-current classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ noncurrent classification.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.

## ASSETS:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## LIABILITIES:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

## 1.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

- a) New standards adopted by the company:

Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract

The amendments specify that that the 'cost of fulfilling' a contract comprises the 'costs that relate directly to the contract. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.

This amendment is essentially clarification and had there is no significant impact on the standalone fin ancial statements of the company

Amendments to Ind AS 16- Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use

The amendments modified paragraph 17(e) of Ind AS 16 to clarify that excess of net sale proceeds of items produced over the cost of testing, if any, shall not be recognised in the profit or loss but deducted from the directly attributable costs considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2022. These amendments had no impact on the standalone financial statements of the company.

Amendments to Ind AS 103, Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework

This amendment added an exception to the recognition principle of Ind AS 103 Business Combinations to avoid the issue of potential 'day 2' gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or Appendix C, Levies, of Ind AS 37, if incurred separately. The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in Ind AS 37 or Appendix C, Levies, of Ind AS 37, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date.

The amendments also add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

In accordance with the transitional provisions, the company applies the amendments prospectively, i.e., to business combinations occurring after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments (the date of initial application).

These amendments had no impact on the standalone fin ancial statements of the company as there were no transactions within the scope of these amendments that arose during the period.

## RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On 31 March 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from 01 April 2023, as below:

## IND AS 1 - PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its standalone fin ancial statements.

## IND AS 12 - INCOME TAXES

The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its standalone financial statements.

## IND AS 8 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ERRORS

The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are "monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty". Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require

items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its standalone financial statements.

## b) Foreign currency

## FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previou s fin ancial statements are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- · certain debt instruments classified as measured at FVTOCI;
- · certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value;
- · a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is effective; and
- · qualifying cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are effective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash flows had occurred at the measurement date.

## c) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## FINANCIAL ASSETS

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any significant fin ancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".

Subsequentmeasurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

- · Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- · Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
- · Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
- · Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

## DEBT INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COST

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and

fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in statement of profit and loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## DEBT INSTRUMENT AT FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the OCI. However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## DEBT INSTRUMENT AT FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## EQUITY INVESTMENTS

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

to which Ind AS 103 applies are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment.

However, on sale the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURE:

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1 April 2015.

## DERECOGNITION

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fin ancial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

- · the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
- · Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks

and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fina ncial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

Subsequentmeasurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains or losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profit and loss.

However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any fina ncial liability as FVTPL.

## LOANS AND BORROWINGS

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs

that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included a s fin ance costs in the statement of profit and loss.

## DERECOGNITION

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles Brazilian reals, South African rands ("ZAR"), Romanian new leus ("RON") and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classified as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## HEDGES OF HIGHLY PROBABLE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flo w hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classified to the statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the statement of profit and loss as finance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in OCI is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## HEDGES OF RECOGNISED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## HEDGES OF CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "shortterm" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

## d) Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method regardless of whether

equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is comprised of:

- · fair values of the assets transferred;
- · liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
- · equity interests issued by the Company;
- · fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
- · fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values.

For each business combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of:

- · the consideration transferred;
- · the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and
- · the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity.

over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Company re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

- e) Property, plant and equipment

## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Selling and other expense" in the statement of profit and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                              | Years    |
|------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings   | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                   | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and equipment                      | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and office equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                 | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fixed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## f) Goodwill and other intangible assets

## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

| Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the  carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment loss on such an                                                                | Goodwill                 |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business  combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. | Other intangible  assets |
| Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and  understanding are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when incurred.                                                                                              |                          |

## Separate acquisition of intangible assets

In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets under development

Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognised as In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets under development. IPR&D assets are not amortised, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such IPR&D assets is recorded in the statement of profit and loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

## AMORTISATION

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortisation expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows::

| Particulars                 | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 25 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful lives or expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate and are treated as change in accounting estimate.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss under "Impairment of noncurrent assets".

## DE-RECOGNITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## g) Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognises a right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

- · fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- · variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date
- · amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees

Payments to third parties that generally take the form of up-front payments and milestones for in-licensed products, compounds and intellectual property are capitalised. The Company's criteria for capitalisation of such assets are consistent with the guidance given in paragraph 25 of Indian Accounting Standard 38 ("Ind AS 38") (i.e., the receipt of economic benefits embodied in each intangible asset separately purchased or licensed in the transaction is considered to be probable).

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

- · the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- · payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The Company's lease liabilities are included in borrowings.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to statement of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of the following:

- · the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- · any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- · any initial direct costs, and
- · restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the statement of profit and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Company.

## h) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and finished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method.

Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to reflect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## i) Impairment

## NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cashgenerating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

## j) Employee benefits

## SHORT-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defined benefit obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit and loss in employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defined benefit obligation and plan assets are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## TERMINATION BENEFITS

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## COMPENSATED ABSENCES

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualified actuary.

## k) Share-based payments

## EQUITY SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee benefit expense, in the statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## CASH SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally

entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## l) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

## RESTRUCTURING

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## ONEROUS CONTRACTS

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## REIMBURSEMENT RIGHTS

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the statement of profit and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specific expense for which the provision has been made.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## m) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## SALE OF GOODS

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates.

Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

| Particulars                                                               | Point of recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales of generic  products in India                                       | Upon delivery of products to distributors  by clearing and forwarding agents of  the Company. Control over the generic  products is transferred by the Company  when the goods are delivered to  distributors from clearing and forwarding  agents. |
| Sales of active  pharmaceutical  ingredients and  intermediates in  India | Upon delivery of products to customers  (generally formulation manufacturers),  from the factories of the Company.                                                                                                                                  |
| Export sales  and other sales  outside of India                           | Upon delivery of the products to the  customers unless the terms of the  applicable contract provide for specific  revenue generating activities to be  completed, in which case revenue is  recognised once all such activities are  completed.    |

## PROFIT SHARE REVENUES

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confirmation of units sold and net sales or net profit computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## OUT LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES

Revenues include amounts derived from product outlicensing agreements. These arrangements typically

<!-- image -->

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, nonrefundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred

## REFUND LIABILITY

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of actual sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially

measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## SERVICES

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## LICENSE FEES

License fees primarily consist of income from the outlicensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## n) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling and other expenses.

## o) Other income and finance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Finance cost consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method. The associated cash flows are classified as financing activities in the statement of cash flows.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.

## p) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- · temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit;
- · temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

- · When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and,
- at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
- · In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in OCI or directly in equity, respectively.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## q) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## r) Government grants and incentives

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the statement of profit and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## s) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## t) Rounding of amounts

All amounts in Indian Rupees disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining

fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- · Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the Management, based on market knowledge, reputation,

independence and whether professional standards are maintained.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multiperiod excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefits.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the

issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

## h) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS 103, "Fair Value Measurement" refers to as Level 3 inputs.

2.3

Goodwill

Goodwill arising upon business combinations is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired.

| Net carrying value                       | 853                   | 853                   |

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Particulars                          |   As at 31 March 2023 |   As at 31 March 2022 |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Global Generics-Branded Formulations |                   853 |                   853 |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value-in-use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cas h flo ws. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash flows for five years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0 to 2%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used range from 7.4% to 12.5 % for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rates range from 9.7% to 19.3%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

During the year ended 31 March 2023, pursuant to an arrangement with a bank, the Company sold to the bank certain of its trade receivables forming part of its Global Generics segment, on a non-recourse basis. The receivables sold were mutually agreed upon with the bank after considering the creditworthiness and contractual terms with the customer. The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such receivables sold to the bank, and accordingly, the same were derecognised in the statements of financial position. As on 31 March 2023 the amount of trade receivables de-recognised pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement was ' 1, 247.

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on its trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers. The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 are as follows:

## Revenue from contracts with customers and trade receivables

## Details of contract asset:

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

- (1) As at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, 286,533 and 13,284 options, respectively, were excluded from the diluted weighted average number of equity shares calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. The average market value of the Company's shares for the purpose of calculating the dilutive effect of stock options was based on quoted market prices for the year during which the options were outstanding.

## Employee stock incentive plans

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend issued by the Company in 2006 August the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

| Particulars                                                       | Number of options  reserved under  category A   | Number of options  reserved under  category B   | Total     |

| Options reserved after stock dividend (A+B+C)                     | 505,939                                         | 3,843,163                                       | 4,349,102 |

The term of the DRL 2002 plan was extended for a period of 10 years effective as of 29 January 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

Stock option activity under the DRL 2002 Plan for the two categories of options during the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 is as follows:

Category A - Fair Market Value Options: There was no stock activity under this category during the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 and there were no stock options outstanding under this category as of 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and five years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

The DRL 2018 Plan provides for option grants having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant as follows:

| Particulars                            | Number of securities  to be acquired from  secondary market   | Number of securities  to be issued by the  Company   | Total     |

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 was ' 72 and ' 212, respectively. As of 31 March 2023, options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 384 and options exercisable had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 110.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behaviour of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

## The weighted avarage inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

## d. Deferred tax assets and liabilities

The tax effects of significant temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of items that created those differences is given below:

| Particulars                           | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2022   |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Deferred tax assets/(liabilities):    |                       |                       |
| Minimum Alternate Tax*                | -                     | 3,929                 |
| Trade receivables                     | 206                   | 270                   |
| Operating tax loss/capital loss       | -                     | -                     |
| Current liabilities and provisions    | 490                   | 208                   |
| Loans                                 | (10)                  | (53)                  |
| Property , plant and equipment        | (3,973)               | (4,169)               |
| Investments                           | (105)                 | 9                     |
| Net deferred tax assets/(Liabilities) | (3,392)               | 194                   |

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefits of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards.

Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

A net gain/loss of ' Nil, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the foreign exchange gain and losses and finance costs. Accordingly, the Company has recorded, as part of statement of profit and loss, a net gain of ' Nil and ' 32 for the year ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, respectively.

The Company had outstanding cross currency swap against INR borrowing of ' Nil as at 31 March 2023 and ' Nil as on 31 March 2022. The swap hedges the principal repayment of underlying INR liability and transforms it into US $ principal repayment liability.

## Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitiv e fin ancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in United States dollars, Russian roubles, U.K pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings. A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.28 above.

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- a) ' 6,141/(6,221) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 4,278/(4,278) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at 31 March 2023;
- b) ' 3,169/(2,937) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 6,351/(6,354) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at 31 March 2022;

The following table analyses foreign currency risk from non-derivative financial instruments as at 31 March 2023:

For the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by ' 4,081 and ' 5,950, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2023, the Company had no loans with floating interest rates. As of 31 March 2022, the Company had loans wit h flo ating interest rates as follows: ' 13,800 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill and ' 4,000 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill minus 5 bps and ' 411 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill plus 25 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profiles, refer note 2.10A of these financial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., Treasury bill) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by ' Nil and ' 68, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e, certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short and long durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generall y flu ctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2023, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

Financial risk management

## b. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specific industry sectors or specific country risks.

## Details of financial assets - not due, past due and impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2023. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days.

Other than trade receivables and loans and advances, the Company has no significant class of financial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ' 50,194 and ' 25,489 respectively.

As at 31 March 2023, the Company had working capital of ' 93,486, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 1,123, investments in term deposits with banks (i.e., deposits having original maturities more than 3 months but less than 12 months) of ' 5,335, investments in bonds of ' 2,894, investment in commercial paper of ' 2,328, investment in market linked debentures of ' 994 and investments mutual funds of ' 36,692.

Contingent liabilities and commitments

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings (collectively, "Legal Proceedings"), including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is often difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company based on internal and external legal advice discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the Legal Proceedings referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its financial statements or cashflows, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such Legal Proceedings were to result in judgments against the Company, such judgments could be material to its results of operations or cashflows in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

## Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specified product" and fix the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfloxacin as a "specified product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fixing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favor of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by filing a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfloxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fixed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defence against the demand.

For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA filed a counter affidavit stating that the inclusion of Norfloxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fixing of prices for Norfloxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. In addition, the Company have filed writ petitions challenging the inclusion and designation of Theophylline/Doxofylline, Cloxacillin and Ciprofloxacin as "specified product" as per DPCO 1995 and the related Demand Notices issued thereunder. The matters are tagged along with the Norfloxacin matter and have been adjourned to 12 July 2023 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifications/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notified maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

Contingent liabilities and commitments

On 20 March 2017, the IPA filed an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application filed by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had filed, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company filed a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to file a final counter affidavit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could file a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter affidavit was filed by the Union of India. The Company subsequently filed a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 25 May 2023 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 395 under "Selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

The Company believes that all of the aforesaid complaints and asserted claims are without merit and it denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable at this time. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements of the Company.

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were filed against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifically, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plaintiffs in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plaintiffs' right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were filed against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multiproduct litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company filed a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plaintiffs filed opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was filed by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied

the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these fin ancial statements

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafil finished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and finished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the filing of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. The Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of said denial was also denied. The case is continuing in pretrial discovery.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these financial statements.

## (iii) Securities Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Officer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public filings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws, and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were affected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 25 June 2018, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and, on 25 July 2018, a further reply in support of the motion to dismiss was filed by the Company. In August 2018, oral argument on the motion to dismiss was heard by the Court.

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions. On 15 May 2020, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., and certain of the Company's current or former directors and officers have entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the "Stipulation") with lead plaintiff the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi in the putative securities class action filed against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. As consideration for the settlement of the class action, the Company has agreed to pay U.S.$9.

The settlement is subject to the approval of the court and may be terminated prior to court approval pursuant to the grounds for termination set forth in the Stipulation. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the settlement consideration, the lead plaintiff and members of the settlement class who do not opt-out of this settlement would release, among other things, the claims that were asserted, or that they could have asserted, in this class action. In entering into the settlement, the defendants do not admit, and explicitly deny, any liability or wrongdoing of any kind.

Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, the settlement resolves the remainder of the litigation.

As the Company is adequately insured with respect to the aforesaid liability, the settlement did not have any impact on the Company's statement of profit and loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

The amount payable to the plaintiffs on account of the settlement and the corresponding receivable from the insurer have been presented under "other current financial assets" and "other current financial liabilities", respectively, in the balance sheet of the Company as at 31 March 2020.

On 23 December 2020, the court issued a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement/court order, the escrow was funded on 4 January 2021. The effective date of the settlement occurred on 1 February 2021, upon transfer of the settlement fund balance into the final escrow account. As the transfer of funds to the final escrow account constitutes settlement of liability, the amount of liability has been derecognised during the year ended 31 March 2021.

## (iv) Internal Investigation

The Company received an anonymous complaint in September 2020, alleging that healthcare professionals in Ukraine and potentially in other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the Company in violation of U.S. anti-corruption laws, specifically the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Company disclosed the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and Securities Exchange Board of India. The Company engaged a U.S. law firm to conduct the investigation at the instruction of a committee of the Company's Board of Directors. On 6 July 2021 the Company received a subpoena from the SEC for the production of related documents, which were provided to the SEC.

The Company made presentations to the SEC and the DOJ in relation to the investigation with respect to certain countries during the current and previous fiscal year. The Company also made a presentation to the SEC and the DOJ in relation to its Global Compliance Framework, including the ongoing enhancement initiatives, during the year ended 31 March 2023. The Company is complying with its listing obligations as it relates to updating the regulatory agencies. While the findings from the aforesaid investigations could result in government or regulatory enforcement actions against the Company in the United States and/or foreign jurisdictions, which can lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws, the outcomes including liabilities are not reasonably ascertainable at this time

## (v) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollaram and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effluents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fixed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee.

The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgment dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently filed a review petition against the judgment on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgment dated 16 November 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company filed an appeal challenging this judgment.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgment in July 2018 and directed the respondents to fil e their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents filed counter affidavits and the matter has now been adjourned for final hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing. The Hon'ble High Court has closed the matter in June 2022, by granting liberty for the Company to take proper recourse for remedies available under the NGT Act, 2010 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgment of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued GO.Ms. No. 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded

Contingent liabilities and commitments

fiscal year, i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019.

During the three months ended September, 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") has issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated 24 October 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of the such effected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram. The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application filed by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5 % as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated 3 August 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G.O.Ms No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and basis the judgment of NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017 for the fiscal years 2015-2016 to 2018-2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2, CTO-3 and CTO-5 of the Company.

On 22 November 2019, The Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued an Interim Order which stayed the demand on the condition that the Company deposit ' 60 as the remediation fee for the fiscal year 2018-2019 payable in the fiscal year 2019-2020. The deposit of ' 60 was made and the Interim Order is continuing. The matter was adjourned to 22 April 2020 but has been delayed as a result of the closure of the Court due to the COVID-19 lockdown, and a new date has not yet been rescheduled. The Hon'ble High Court has disposed of the matter with a liberty to the Company to approach the NGT, if necessary. The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the financial statements.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specified by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners that was pending in the National Green Tribunal, (the "NGT"), Delhi.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the NGT. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to the point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notification that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

The appeals filed by Mr. K. Chidambaram against the Orders of the Appellate Authority, Andhra Pradesh are disposed as the same do not survive for consideration as the G.O. based on which the then APPCB had passed its order which was subject matter of appeal before the Appellate Authority has itself been amended vide order 25 July 2013. However, the NGT, Delhi has passed a direction for the issue of pollution to be considered by the Joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Institute ("NEERI"), and the Telangana State Pollution Control Board to ascertain the present status of pollution issues in the Medak, Ranga Reddy, Mahaboobnagar and Nalagonda districts in the State of Telangana particularly in the Patancheru and Bollaram industrial clusters and file a report within three months before the NGT, Delhi.

## (vi) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges.

However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional financial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (vii) Indirect taxes related matters

Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company has received various demand notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded       | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Impact of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine

The Company considered the uncertainty relating to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine in assessing the recoverability of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. The outcome of the war is difficult to predict, and it could have an adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment. Management has considered all potential impacts of the war including adherence of global sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia and any retaliatory actions taken by Russia. For this purpose, the Company considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these financial statements.

The Company's supply chain has been impacted primarily in Russia and Ukraine, both in terms of higher freight costs and increase in the lead time by suppliers. However, the Company has been able to service its customers without any significant shortages or disruptions. The Company based on its judgments, estimates and assumptions including sensitivity analysis, expects to fully recover the carrying amount of receivables, inventory, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. Accordingly, during the year ended 31 March 2023, the impact of this conflict on the Company's operations and financial condition was not material. The Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

## Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements OPINION

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Dr Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as "the Holding Company"), its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group") and joint ventures comprising of the consolidated Balance sheet as at 31 March 2023, the consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss, including other comprehensive income, the consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the consolidated fin ancial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as "the consolidated financial statements").

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us and based on the consideration of reports of other auditors on separate financial statements and on the other fin ancial information of the subsidiaries, the aforesaid consolidated fin ancial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Group and joint ventures as at 31 March 2023, their consolidated profit including other comprehensive income, their consolidated cash flows and the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## BASIS FOR OPINION

We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(m) of the significant accounting policies, and note 2.33 (A) containing details of contingencies in the consolidated financial statements)

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Group assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case-to-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the difficulty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the consolidated financial statements.

Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at different levels in the Group, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.
- · We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Group's inhouse legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We compared the evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. We tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- · We obtained legal letters from the Group's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate, we examined correspondences connected with the cases.

the Consolidated Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group and its joint venture in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

## KEY AUDIT MATTERS

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of audit procedures performed by us and by other auditors of components not audited by us, as reported by them in their audit reports furnished to us by the management, including those procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

- · We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities.
- · We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of material tax positions and assessed the technical merits based on the correspondence and assessments from the relevant tax authorities.
- · We also evaluated the disclosures made in the consolidated financial statements.

Rebates, discounts, chargebacks, and other deductions in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(n) of the significant accounting policies of consolidated financial statements and note 2.14 of the consolidated financial statements)

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for chargeback, rebates, sales returns and discounts, etc. The estimates relating to these accruals are important given the significance of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

- · We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes.
- · We also tested management's controls over the methods for making estimates, data and assumptions of the estimates used to calculate the sales deductions.
- · We tested management's estimated sales deductions and obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates. We tested management's estimates over the determination of sales deductions accruals by comparing the rates used in management's estimate to rates in the underlying contracts and historical sales deductions data.
- · We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, as applicable to current payment trends.
- · We also considered the historical accuracy of the management's estimates in prior years and assessed the estimated amounts, we evaluated trends in actual sales and discount accrual balances.
- · We also tested the underlying data used in management's calculations for accuracy and completeness and verified source data supporting the inventory levels, rebate claims paid subsequent to period end, the historical sales and sales return levels and volume discounts settled during the period.
- · We tested recording of revenue in appropriate period which included the following procedures:
- · Performed trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous periods;
- · Tested management's monitoring process over distributors' stocking levels;
- · Verified sample sales transactions near period-end.

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and of its joint ventures to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those Charged with Governance are also responsible for overseeing the financial reporting process of the Group and of its joint ventures.

## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.
- · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
- · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- · Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group of which we are the independent auditors and whose financial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated financial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidate d fin ancial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

<!-- image -->

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year ended 31 March 2023 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

## OTHER MATTER

- (a) We did not audit the financial statements and other financial information, in respect of two subsidiaries whose financial statements include total assets of H 29,445 million as at 31 March 2023, and total revenues of H 33,087 million and net cash outflows of H 18 million for the year ended on that date.

## ANNEXURE '2' TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMTED

## REPORT ON THE INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS UNDER CLAUSE (I) OF SUB-SECTION 3 OF SECTION 143 OF THE COMPANIES ACT, 2013 ("THE ACT")

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company") as of and for the year ended 31 March 2023, we have audited the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group") and its joint venture, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

## MANAGEMENT'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint venture, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITY

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's internal financial controls with reference to consolidated fin ancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to

<!-- image -->

consolidated financial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated fin ancial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the interna l fin ancial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements.

## MEANING OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated financial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control with reference to consolidated fin ancial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

## INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL CONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## OPINION

In our opinion, the Group and its joint venture, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, adequate internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements and such internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements were operating effectively as at 31 March 2023, based on the internal control ove r fin ancial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note issued by the ICAI.

## OTHER MATTERS

Our report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial controls with reference to consolidated financial statements of the Holding Company, in so far as it relates to the subsidiary companies and joint venture, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such subsidiaries and joint venture incorporated in India.

## 1.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## a) Statement of compliance

These consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 March 2023 comply in all material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notified under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, and as amended from time to time together with the comparative period data as at and for the year ended 31 March 2022.

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are effective or elected for early adoption at the Company's annual reporting date, 31 March 2022. These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on 10 May 2023.

## b) Basis of measurement

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an

accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

- · derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value;
- · financial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost, depending on the classification;
- · employee defined benefit assets/(liabilities) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for actuarial gains/(losses) and the present value of the defined benefit obligation;
- · long-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method;
- · share-based payments are measured at fair value;
- · investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method;
- · assets held for sale are measured at fair value;
- · assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations are measured at fair value;
- · contingent consideration arising out of business combination are measured at fair value; and
- · right-of-use the assets are recognised at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at that date. This amount is adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs, incurred, if any.

## c) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements is included in the following notes:

- · Note 1.3(b) - Evaluation of joint arrangements;
- · Note 1.3(c) - Assessment of functional currency;

- · Note 1.3(d) - Financial instruments;
- · Note 1.3(e) - Business combinations and goodwill;
- · Notes 1.3(f) and 1.3(g) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- · Notes 1.3(h) - Determination of cost for right-of-use assets and lease term;
- · Note 1.3(i) - Valuation of inventories;
- · Note 1.3(j) - Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;
- · Note 1.3(k) - Assets and obligations relating to employee benefits;
- · Note 1.3(l) - Share-based payments;
- · Note 1.3(m) - Provisions and other accruals;
- · Note 1.3(n) - Measurement of transaction price in a revenue transaction (sales returns, rebates and chargeback provisions);
- · Note 1.3(q) -Evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and estimation of income tax payable and income tax expense in relation to uncertain tax positions; and
- · Note 1.3(m) - Contingencies

## d) Current and non-current classification

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, " Presentation of Financial Statements".

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;

- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

## 1.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

- a) New standards adopted by the company:

Ind AS 37 - Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets: Onerous Contracts - Costs of Fulfilling a Contract

The amendments specify that that the 'cost of fulfilling' a contract comprises the 'costs that relate directly to the contract. Costs that relate directly to a contract can either be incremental costs of fulfilling that contract (examples would be direct labour, materials) or an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts.

This amendment is essentially clarification and had there is no significant impact on the consolidated fin ancial statements of the Group.

Amendments to Ind AS 16- Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before Intended Use

The amendments modified paragraph 17(e) of Ind AS 16 to clarify that excess of net sale proceeds of items produced over the cost of testing, if any, shall not be recognised in the profit or loss but deducted from the directly attributable costs considered as part of cost of an item of property, plant, and equipment.

The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2022. These amendments had no impact on the consolidated fin ancial statements of the Group.

<!-- image -->

Amendments to Ind AS 103, Business Combinations: Reference to the Conceptual Framework

This amendment added an exception to the recognition principle of Ind AS 103 Business Combinations to avoid the issue of potential 'day 2' gains or losses arising for liabilities and contingent liabilities that would be within the scope of Ind AS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or Appendix C, Levies, of Ind AS 37, if incurred separately. The exception requires entities to apply the criteria in Ind AS 37 or Appendix C, Levies, of Ind AS 37, respectively, instead of the Conceptual Framework, to determine whether a present obligation exists at the acquisition date.

The amendments also add a new paragraph to IFRS 3 to clarify that contingent assets do not qualify for recognition at the acquisition date.

In accordance with the transitional provisions, the company applies the amendments prospectively, i.e., to business combinations occurring after the beginning of the annual reporting period in which it first applies the amendments (the date of initial application).

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated fin ancial statements of the Group as there were no transactions within the scope of these amendments that arose during the period.

## RECENT PRONOUNCEMENTS

Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. On 31 March 2023, MCA amended the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 by issuing the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2023, applicable from 01 April 2023, as below:

## IND AS 1 - PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The amendments require companies to disclose their material accounting policies rather than their significant accounting policies. Accounting policy information, together with other information, is material when it can reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of general purpose financial statements. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its consolidated fin ancial statements.

## IND AS 12 - INCOME TAXES

The amendments clarify how companies account for deferred tax on transactions such as leases and decommissioning obligations. The amendments

narrowed the scope of the recognition exemption in paragraphs 15 and 24 of Ind AS 12 (recognition exemption) so that it no longer applies to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. The Group does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its consolidated financial statements.

## IND AS 8 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ERRORS

The amendments will help entities to distinguish between accounting policies and accounting estimates. The definition of a change in accounting estimates has been replaced with a definition of accounting estimates. Under the new definition, accounting estimates are "monetary amounts in financial statements that are subject to measurement uncertainty". Entities develop accounting estimates if accounting policies require items in financial statements to be measured in a way that involves measurement uncertainty. The Company does not expect this amendment to have any significant impact in its consolidated financial statements.

## b) Basis of consolidation

## SUBSIDIARIES

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2023. Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.

Consolidated financial statements are prepared using uniform accounting policies for like transactions and other events in similar circumstances. If a subsidiary of the Company uses accounting policies other than those adopted in the consolidated financial statements for like transactions and events in similar circumstances, appropriate adjustments are made to that subsidiary's financial statements in preparing the consolidated

<!-- image -->

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

financial statements to ensure conformity with the Company's accounting policies.

## JOINT ARRANGEMENTS (EQUITY ACCOUNTED INVESTEES)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the parties have joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic financial and operating decisions. The considerations made in determining whether significant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.

A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

With respect to joint operations, the Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest ("NCI") holders have certain significant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in significant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated fin ancial statements, the accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. Furthermore, the financial statements of the joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as of the Company.

## CONSOLIDATION PROCEDURE

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated financial statements, intra-group transactions are consolidated using the following procedures:

- a. Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.
- b. Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary and the parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary.
- c. Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and property, plant and equipment are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements.

## CHANGES IN OWNERSHIP INTERESTS

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the difference arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash flows are classified as financing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## LOSS OF CONTROL

At the time of loss of control, the Company

- · derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost
- · derecognises the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interests
- · derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity
- · recognises the fair value of the consideration received
- · recognises the fair value of any investment retained
- · recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss
- · recognise that distribution of shares of subsidiary to Group in Group's capacity as owners

<!-- image -->

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

- · reclassifies the parent's share of components previously recognised in OCI to profit or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings, if required by other Ind ASs as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities

## c) Foreign currency

## FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these entities are largely restricted to importing of finished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash flows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The cash flows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The costs incurred by these entities are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The financing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are selfcontained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been generally determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions, unless use of a different currency is considered appropriate.

## FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previou s fin ancial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- · certain debt instruments classified as measured at FVTOCI;
- · certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value;
- · a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is effective; and
- · qualifying cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are effective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash flows had occurred at the measurement date.

## FOREIGN OPERATIONS

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR").

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the reporting currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the reporting currency at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, such that control, significant influence or joint control is lost, the relevant amount in the FCTR is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## d) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## FINANCIAL ASSETS

Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any significant fin ancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".

## Subsequentmeasurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, financial assets are classified in four categories:

- · Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- · Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
- · Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
- · Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

## DEBT INSTRUMENTS AT AMORTISED COST

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and

fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in consolidated statement of profit and loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## DEBT INSTRUMENT AT FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash flows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the OCI. However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## DEBT INSTRUMENT AT FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## EQUITY INVESTMENTS

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination

<!-- image -->

to which Ind AS 103 applies, are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of profit and loss, even on sale of investment.

However, on sale the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## DERECOGNITION

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fin ancial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheet) when:

- · the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
- · Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated

liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## IMPAIRMENT OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fina ncial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

Subsequentmeasurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:

## FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered

<!-- image -->

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as FVTPL.

## LOANS AND BORROWINGS

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included a s fin ance costs in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## DERECOGNITION

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms,

or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus, Australian dollars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Mexican pesos, Ukrainian hryvnias and Brazilian reals.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classified as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## HEDGES OF HIGHLY PROBABLE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

The Company classifies its derivative financial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flo w hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as finance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

<!-- image -->

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in OCI is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## HEDGES OF RECOGNISED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## HEDGES OF CHANGES IN THE INTEREST RATES

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "shortterm" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

## e) Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement

with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is comprised of:

- · fair values of the assets transferred;
- · liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
- · equity interests issued by the Company;
- · fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
- · fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values. For each business combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

<!-- image -->

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of:

- · the consideration transferred,
- · the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and
- · the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity.

over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

## f) Property, plant and equipment

## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Selling and other expense" in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## DEPRECIATION

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

<!-- image -->

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                              | Years    |
|------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings   | 20 to 50 |
| - Ancillary structures                   | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and equipment                      | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and office equipment | 3 to 10  |
| Vehicles                                 | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fixed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## g) Goodwill and other intangible assets

## RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT

| Goodwill                 | Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of non-controlling interest in the  acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity accounted investees, the  carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment loss on such an   |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Other intangible  assets | Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have finite useful lives are measured at cost less  accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business  combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition.                                                                                                                                                        |
|                          | Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and  understanding are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when incurred. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and  processes. Development expenditures are capitalised only if:                                                         |
| Separate acquisition     | compounds and intellectual property are capitalised. The Company's criteria for capitalisation of such assets are  consistent with the guidance given in paragraph 25 of Indian Accounting Standard ("Ind AS 38") (i.e., the receipt of  to be probable).                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| of intangible assets     | Payments to third parties that generally take the form of up-front payments and milestones for in-licensed products,  economic benefits embodied in each intangible asset separately purchased or licensed in the transaction is considered                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## SUBSEQUENT EXPENDITURE

| Other intangible  assets                                                                      | Subsequent expenditures are capitalised only when they increase the future economic benefits embodied in the  specific asset to which they relate. All other expenditures, including expenditures on internally generated goodwill and  brands, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as incurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D")  or Intangible assets  under development | Subsequent expenditure on an IPR&D or intangible assets under development project acquired separately or in a  business combination and recognised as an intangible asset is: ·  recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is a research expenditure;  ·   recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is a development expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for  recognition as an intangible asset in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38; and ·   added to the carrying amount of the acquired IPR&D asset, if it is a development expenditure that satisfies the  recognition criteria in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38. |

## AMORTISATION

Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortisation expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows::

| Particulars                 | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 25 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 15 |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful lives or expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate and are treated as change in accounting estimate.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

## DE-RECOGNITION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## h) Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognises a right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

- · fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- · variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date
- · amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees
- · the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- · payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

<!-- image -->

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to consolidated statement of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of the following:

- · the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- · any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- · any initial direct costs, and
- · restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Company.

## i) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and finished goods. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in

operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to reflect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## j) Impairment

## NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cashgenerating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cashgenerating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

<!-- image -->

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## k) Employee benefits

## SHORT-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS

The liability in respect of defined benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualified actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defined benefit obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used.

The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defined benefit obligation and plan assets are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## TERMINATION BENEFITS

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## OTHER LONG-TERM EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## COMPENSATED ABSENCES

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive

<!-- image -->

cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualified actuary.

## l) Share-based payments

## EQUITY SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## CASH SETTLED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.

The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## m) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money

is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

## RESTRUCTURING

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## ONEROUS CONTRACTS

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## REIMBURSEMENT RIGHTS

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the consolidate statement of profit and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specific expense for which the provision has been made.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND CONTINGENT ASSETS

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

<!-- image -->

## n) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## SALE OF GOODS

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received

or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates. Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

| Particulars                                                            | Point of recognition of revenue                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sales of generic products in India                                     | Upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company. Control  over the generic products is transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to distributors  from clearing and forwarding agents. |
| Sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients  and intermediates in India | Upon delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories of  the Company.                                                                                                                               |
| Export sales and other sales outside of India                          | Upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide  for specific revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised once  all such activities are completed.    |

## PROFIT SHARE REVENUES

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confirmation of units sold and net sales or net profit computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## OUT LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS, MILESTONE PAYMENTS AND ROYALTIES

Revenues include amounts derived from product outlicensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-

<!-- image -->

refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

## PROVISION FOR CHARGEBACK, REBATES AND DISCOUNTS

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesalers for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesalers/ other customers.

## SHELF STOCK ADJUSTMENTS

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition or otherwise. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifically limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be offered.

## REFUND LIABILITY

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets

in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of actual sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability, the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## SERVICES

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## LICENSE FEES

License fees primarily consist of income from the outlicensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## o) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs

<!-- image -->

incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling and other expenses.

## p) Other income and finance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Finance cost consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss using the effective interest method. The associated cash flows are classified as fin ancing activities in the statement of cash flows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange differences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges.

## q) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:

- · temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit;

- · temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

- · When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
- · In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

<!-- image -->

Current and deferred tax is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in OCI or directly in equity, respectively.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## r) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## s) Government grants and incentives

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## t) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Chief Executive Officer of the Company is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and accordingly is identified as the chief operating decision maker.

## u) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## v) Non-currents assets held for sale

The Company classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Noncurrent assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expense. The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Property, plant and equipment are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. Assets classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the consolidated balance sheet.

## w) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specific to that asset or liability.

<!-- image -->

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- · Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the Management, based on market knowledge, reputation,

independence and whether professional standards are maintained

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multiperiod excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefits.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

<!-- image -->

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative financial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

## h) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS 103, "Fair Value Measurement" refers to as Level 3 inputs.

- a) Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment -' 44 ( ' 2,570)
- (2) During the year ended 31 March 2022, there was a significant decline in the expected cash flows of the Company's subsidiary, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Louisiana, LLC (Shreveport Cash Generating Unit ("CGU")). Consequently, the Company tested the carrying amount of the CGU, being the smallest identifiable group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or group of assets. This resulted in the recoverable amount of the CGU being lower than its carrying amount. Accordingly, the Company recognised an impairment loss of ' 44 & ' 2,955 was recorded for the year ended 31 March 2023 & 31 March 2022 respectively as below:
- b) Impairment of Goodwill - Nil ( ' 311)
- The impairment losses forms part of the Company's Global Generics segment."
- c) Impairment in Capital work-in-progress - Nil ( ' 74 (including capital advances H 12))

Impairment losses recorded for the year ended 31 March 2023

Impairment losses recorded for the year ended 31 March 2022

During the year ended 31 March 2022, the Company recorded impairment loss of ' 311 pertaining to Shreveport CGU. Refer Note 2.1 for details. The said goodwill was included as part of "Global Generics-North America Operations" in the below mentioned schedule for allocation of goodwill among CGUs.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill (other than those arising upon investment in a joint venture) was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| Global Generics-Germany Operations       | 2,386                 | 2,506                 |
| Global Generics-Complex Injectables      | 2,011                 | 1,894                 |

| Global Generics-North America Operations | 1                     | 1                     |
|                                          | 5,474                 | 5,473                 |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value in use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash flows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cas h flo ws. Key assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash flows for five years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash flows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0% to 2%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used range from 7.4% to 12.5% for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rates range from 9.7% to 19.3%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

During the year ended 31 March 2023, pursuant to an arrangement with a bank, the Company sold to the bank certain of its trade receivables forming part of its Global Generics segment, on a non-recourse basis. The receivables sold were mutually agreed upon with the bank after considering the creditworthiness and contractual terms with the customer. The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such receivables sold to the bank, and accordingly, the same were derecognised in the statements of financial position. As on 31 March 2023, the amount of trade receivables de-recognized pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement was H 12,376.

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on its trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers. The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 are as follows:

- * Currently, the Company do not separately track provisions and adjustments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks. However, the adjustments are expected to be non-material. The volumes used to calculate the closing balance of chargebacks represent approximately 1.1 to 1.4 months equivalent of sales, which corresponds to the pending chargeback claims yet to be processed.
- (1) Chargebacks provisions and payments for the year ended 31 March 2022 were each higher as compared to the year ended 31 March 2021, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes and also due to higher pricing rates per unit for chargebacks, due to reduction in the contract prices through which the product is resold in the retail part of the supply chain for certain of the Company's products, which were partially off-set due to a lower pricing rates per unit for chargebacks. Such lower pricing rates were primarily on account of a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company products.. The rebates provisions and payments for the year ended 31 March 2022 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2021, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for rebates, due to a reduction in the contract prices through which the product is resold in the retail part of the supply chain for certain of the Company's products.
- ** Currently, the Company does not separately track the credits and payments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks, rebates, medicaid payments or refund liability.
- (2) Chargebacks provisions and payments for the year ended 31 March 2023 were each higher as compared to the year ended 31 March 2022, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes and also due to higher pricing rates per unit for chargebacks, due to reduction in the contract prices through which the product is resold in the retail part of the supply chain for certain of the Company products, which were partially off-set due to a lower pricing rates per unit for chargebacks. Such lower pricing rates were primarily on account of a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company products The rebates provisions and payments for the year ended 31 March 2023 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2022, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for rebates, due to reduction in the contract prices through which the product is resold in the retail part of the supply chain for certain of the Company products.
- (3) The Company's overall refund liability as at 31 March 2023 relating to the Company North America Generics business was U.S.$35 million, as compared to a liability of U.S.$24 million as at 31 March 2022. This increase in liability was primarily attributable to higher refund liability created for new product launches, volume growth, product mix change for the year ended March 2023, as compared to the year ended 31 March 2022.

The estimates of "gross-to-net" adjustments for the Company's operations in India and other countries outside of the United States relate mainly to refund liability in all such operations, and certain rebates to healthcare insurance providers are specific to the Company's German operations. The pattern of such refund liability is generally consistent with the Company's gross sales. In Germany, the rebates to healthcare insurance providers mentioned above are contractually fixed in nature and do not involve significant estimations by the Company.

## Details of contract asset:

As mentioned in the accounting policies for refund liability set forth in note 1.3 (n) of these consolidated financial statements, the Company recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods), which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

As on 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, the Company had ' 48 and ' 43, respectively, as contract assets representing the right to returned goods.

## 2.26 Segment reporting

The Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by operating segments. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profit as the performance indicator for all of the operating segments, and does not review the total assets and liabilities of an operating segment.

The Company's reportable operating segments are as follows:

- · Global Generics;
- · Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI");
- · Others.*

As discussed below, Proprietary Products ceased to be a reportable operating segment effective 1 April 2022.

Global Generics: This segment consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing prescription and over-the-counter finished pharmaceutical products ready for consumption by the patient, marketed under a brand name (branded formulations) or as generic finished dosages with therapeutic equivalence to branded formulations (generics). This segment includes the operations of the Company's biologics business.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients: This segment primarily consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as "API", which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. The Company also serves its customers with incremental value added products, including semi-finished and finished formulations, which are included in this segment. This segment also includes the Company's pharmaceutical services business, which provides contract research services and manufactures and sells active pharmaceutical ingredients in accordance with the specific customer requirements.

Others*: This segment consists of the Company's other business operations which includes its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Aurigene Oncology Limited ("AOL") (formerly Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited) and SVAAS Wellness Limited ("SVAAS"), and the Company's Proprietary Products business. AOL is a discovery stage biotechnology company developing novel and best-in-class therapies in the fields of oncology and inflammation. AOL works with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through customized models of drug-discovery collaborations. SVAAS is in the business of providing digital healthcare and information technology enabled business support services. The Proprietary Products business focuses on the research and development of differentiated formulations and is expected to earn revenues arising out of monetization of such assets and subsequent royalties, if any.

*As the revenues and gross profits of the Proprietary Products segment are considerably lower than the quantitative thresholds mentioned in INDAS 108, "Operating Segments", the Company believes that Proprietary Products segment no longer qualifies to be a reportable segment and consequently, effective 1 April 2022, the Company included the financial information relating to its Proprietary Products segment in "Others". The corresponding information relating to the Proprietary Products segment for earlier periods has been restated to reflect the aforementioned change.

The measurement of each segment's revenues, expenses and assets is consistent with the accounting policies that are used in preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by the Government of India and in debt securities and equity securities of Indian companies.

## 2.29 Employee stock incentive plans

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan, 2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Employee stock incentive plans

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

Employee stock incentive plans

## Dr. Reddy's Employees ADR Stock Option Plan, 2007 (the "DRL 2007 Plan")

The Company instituted the DRL 2007 Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2005. The DRL 2007 Plan became effective upon its approval by the Board of Directors on 22 January 2007. The DRL 2007 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Committee administers the DRL 2007 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2007 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

The DRL 2007 Plan provides for option grants in two categories:

Category A: 382,695 stock options out of the total of 1,530,779 stock options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,148,084 stock options out of the total of 1,530,779 stock options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Stock options activity under the DRL 2007 Plan for the above two categories of options during the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022 was as follows:

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan")

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and five years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of five years.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

## Employee stock incentive plans

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behaviour of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simplified method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity.

Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions reflect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2023 was lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2022 primarily on account of :-

- · Changes in the Company jurisdictional mix of earnings (i.e., an increase in the proportion of the Company profits from lower tax jurisdictions and decrease in proportion of the Company profits from higher tax jurisdictions) for the year ended 31 March 2023, as compared to year ended 31 March 2022 and,
- · recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax asset on operating tax losses primarily pertaining to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories SA, Switzerland as the Company believes that it is probable that there will be available taxable profits against which such tax losses can be utilised.
- · The Company has considered the impact of recent tax regulations and developments, including updates to its estimate on the impact of adoption of the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act 2019, in determining its "Tax expense, net" for the year ended 31 March 2023

* As per Indian tax laws, companies are liable for a Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") when current tax, as computed under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 ("Tax Act"), is determined to be below the MAT computed under section 115JB of the Tax Act. If in any year the Company pays a MAT, then it is entitled to claim credit of the MAT paid over and above the normal tax liability in the subsequent years. The MAT credit is eligible to be carried forward and set-off in the future against the current tax liabilities over a period of 15 years starting from the succeeding fiscal year in which such credit was generated during the year ended 31 March 2023 the company has utilised the available mat credit.

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry-forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefits of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry-forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Operating loss carry-forward consists of business losses, unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed interest carry-forwards. A portion of this total loss can be carried indefinitely and the remaining amounts expire at various upcoming fiscal years.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

A net gain/loss of ' Nil, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash flow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the foreign exchange gains and losses and finance costs. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of consolidated statement of profit and loss, a net gain of ' Nil and ' 32 for the year ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, respectively.

The Company had outstanding cross currency swap against INR Borrowing of ' Nil as at 31 March 2023 and ' Nil as on 31 March 2022. The swap hedges the principal repayment of underlying INR liability and transforms it into US$ Principal repayment liability.

Financial risk management

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its financial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitiv e fin ancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (U.K. pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus, Austrailian dollars and Euros ) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars, Russian roubles, Mexican pesos, Ukrainian hryvnias and Brazilian reals). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency financial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.31 to these consolidated fin ancial statements.

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% increase/(decrease) in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- a) a ' 5,902/(5,905) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 3,118/(3,118) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at 31 March 2023;
- b) a ' 3,169/(2,937) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve before tax and a ' 5,378/(5,375) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profit from such contracts, as at 31 March 2022.

The following table analyses foreign currency risk from non-derivative financial instruments as at 31 March 2023:

For the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the foreign exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above-mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by ' 4,007 and ' 4,135, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As at 31 March 2023, the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows: ' 648 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of CDI + 1.2% and ' 2,414 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of TIIE + 1.15%.

As at 31 March 2022, the Company had loans with floating interest rates as follows: ' 4,000 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill less 5 bps; ' 13,800 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill; ' 411 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill plus 25 bps; ' 1,137 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR + 80 bps; ' 800 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of CDI + 1.79% and ' 2,017 of loans carrying a floating interest rate of TIIE + 1.15%.

For the years ended 31 March 2023 and 31 March 2022, every 10% increase or decrease in the floating interest rate component (i.e., Indian Treasury Bill, LIBOR, CDI and TIIE) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by ' 37 and ' 89, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short and long durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

For ditles of the companies short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest profits, refer note 2.11 A and B of this consolidated financial statements.

Note that "CDI" means Brazilian interbank deposit rate (Certifi cado de Depósito Interbancário), "TIIE" means the Equilibrium Interbanking Interest Rate (Tasa de Interés Interbancaria de Equilibrio), and "LIBOR" means the London Inter-bank Offered Rate.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generall y flu ctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As at 31 March 2023, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

Financial risk management

## b. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any significant concentration of exposures to specific industry sectors or specific country risks.

## Details of financial assets - not due, past due and impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certificates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2023. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days.

The ageing of trade receivables is given below:

| Particulars                        | As at 31 March 2023   | As at 31 March 2022   |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Neither past due nor impaired      | 65,528                | 51,505                |
| Past due                           |                       |                       |
| Less than 365 days                 | 7,092                 | 15,501                |
| More than 365 days                 | 1,123                 | 1,006                 |
|                                    | 73,743                | 68,012                |
| Less : Allowance for credit losses | (1,258)               | (1,194)               |
| Total                              | 72,485                | 66,818                |

See Note 2.7 B of these consolidated financial statements for the activity in the allowance for credit losses.

Other than trade receivables, the Company has no significant class of financial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2023, and 31 March 2022, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ' 68,516 and ' 39,989 respectively.

As at 31 March 2023, the Company had working capital of ' 118,534, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 5,779, investments in term deposits with banks (i.e., deposits having original maturities more than 3 months but less than 12 months), bonds and commercial paper of ' 16,745, and investments in mutual funds of ' 38,180.

As at 31 March 2022, the Company had working capital of ' 80,165, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 14,852, investments in term deposits with banks (i.e., deposits having original maturities more than 3 months but less than 12 months), bonds and commercial paper of ' 12,562, and investments in mutual funds of ' 16,751.

Contingent liabilities and commitments

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings (collectively, "Legal Proceedings"), including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is often difficult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected financial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company based on internal and external legal advice discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the Legal Proceedings referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements or cashflows, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such Legal Proceedings were to result in judgments against the Company, such judgments could be material to its results of operations or cashflow in a given period.

On 14 June 2018, the U.S. FDA granted the Company final approval for buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg dosages, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Suboxone® sublingual film. The U.S. FDA approval came after the conclusion of litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware District Court"), where the Delaware District Court held that patents covering Suboxone® sublingual film would not be infringed by the Company's commercial launch of its generic sublingual film product. In light of the favorable decision from the Delaware District Court, the Company launched its generic sublingual film product in the United States immediately following the U.S. FDA approval on 14 June 2018. On 12 July 2019 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("the Court of Appeals") affirmed the Delaware District Court's ruling that the Company's generic version of Suboxone® sublingual films did not infringe the two remaining patents at issue in the Delaware District Court's case (U.S. patent numbers 8,603,514 and 8,015,150).

Contingent liabilities and commitments

After the Delaware District Court's decision, Indivior filed a second lawsuit against the Company alleging infringement of three additional U.S. patents (numbers 9,687,454, 9,855,221 and 9,931,305) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the "New Jersey District Court"), styled Indivior Inc. et al. v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories S.A., Civil Action No. 2:17-cv-07111 (D.N.J.). Following the launch, on 15 June 2018, Indivior filed an emergency application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Company in the New Jersey District Court. Indivior's motion alleged that the Company's generic sublingual film product infringed one of three U.S. patents (number 9,931,305) at issue in the New Jersey District Court. Pending a hearing and decision on the injunction application, the New Jersey District Court initially issued a temporary restraining order against the Company with respect to further sales, offer for sales, and imports of its generic sublingual film product in the United States. Subsequently, on 14 July 2018, the New Jersey District Court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of Indivior. Under the order, Indivior was required to and did post a bond of US$72 million to pay the costs and damages sustained by the Company if it was found to be wrongfully enjoined. The Company immediately appealed the decision, and the Court of Appeals agreed to expedite the appeal.

On 20 November 2018, the Court of Appeals issued a decision vacating the preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals denied Indivior's petition for rehearing on 4 February 2019.

Indivior subsequently filed two emergency motions in the Court of Appeals to stay issuance of the mandate and to keep the preliminary injunction in place, which the Court of Appeals denied. Indivior then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to stay issuance of the mandate.

Indivior's petition was denied by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on 19 February 2019, and the mandate was issued on the same day. The Company resumed sales of its generic sublingual film product after the mandate was issued.

On 19 February 2019, the New Jersey District Court entered a stipulated order of dismissal of Indivior's claims under U.S. patent number 9,855,221. On 5 November 2019, the New Jersey District Court issued its claim construction decision construing certain terms in U.S. patent numbers 9,931,305 and 9,687,454. After such claim construction decision, on 8 January 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered a stipulated order that the Company's generic sublingual film product does not infringe the asserted claims in U.S. patent number 9,931,305. In the stipulated order, Indivior reserved the ability to appeal the New Jersey District Court's claim construction order. The Company filed a motion requesting that the New Jersey District Court enter partial final judgment in the Company's favor relating to the allegations of infringement of U.S. patent number 9,931,305, which the District Court denied without prejudice on 24 August 2020, pending resolution of Indivior's allegations relating to U.S. patent number 9,687,454.

On 11 November 2019, a Magistrate Judge in the District of New Jersey granted the Company leave to file a counterclaim against Indivior that alleges that Indivior engaged in anticompetitive conduct by making false or misleading statements to the New Jersey District Court during the preliminary injunction proceedings in violation of federal antitrust laws. Indivior appealed the Magistrate Judge's ruling to the New Jersey District Court Judge and, on 24 August 2020, the New Jersey District Court Judge denied Indivior's appeal. The District Court did grant Indivior's motion to bifurcate the patent claims and the antitrust claims into two separate trials. Fact discovery closed on 29 January 2021, and expert discovery closed on 24 September 2021. Indivior filed a motion for summary judgment that it is immune from antitrust liability under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and that the Company is not entitled to seek damages in excess of the injunction bond. The Company has filed a motion for summary judgment that Indivior's remaining claims for patent infringement are barred by the doctrines of issue preclusion, claim preclusion, and prosecution laches and that Indivior's damages claim should be limited to a reasonable royalty. Summary judgment briefing closed on 12 January 2022. No trial date had been set.

In addition to the District Court proceeding, on 13 November 2018, the Company filed two petitions for inter-partes review challenging the validity of certain claims of U.S. patent number 9,687,454 before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB"). On 13 June 2019, the PTAB agreed to institute inter-partes review on one of the two petitions filed by the Company. The PTAB heard oral argument in the pending inter-partes review challenge on 3 March 2020.

On 2 June 2020, the PTAB issued a final written decision in the Company's favor finding that the Company had demonstrated that claims 1-5, 7, and 9-14 of U.S. Patent No. 9,687,454 ("the 454 patent") were unpatentable. The PTAB upheld the validity of only one of the challenged claims, claim 8. Additionally, claim 6 was not at issue in the inter-partes review and therefore not subject to th e fin al written decision. Claims 6 and 8 remain asserted against the Company in the New Jersey District Court litigation. Indivior filed a timely notice of appeal of the PTAB's Final Written Decision (" FWD") for claims 1-5, 7, and 9-14, and the Company cross appealed the PTAB's FWD on claim 8 On 24 November 2021, a panel of the Federal Circuit issued a decision affirming the PTAB's decision in all respects. On 26 January 2022, Indivior filed a petition with the Federal Circuit seeking rehearing of the panel's decision. On 16 March 2022, the Federal Circuit denied Indivior's petition for rehearing and, the mandate was issued on 23 March 2022. As a result of the Federal Circuit's decision, the only remaining valid claims of the 454 patent to be litigated before the district court were claims 6 and 8.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments

On 23 June 2022, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with Indivior Inc. and Indivior UK Limited, and Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. Under this settlement, the Company will receive payments totaling U.S.$72 by 31 March 2024. The agreement resolves all claims between the parties relating to the Company's generic buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual film, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg dosages, including Indivior's and Aquestive's patent infringement allegations and the Company's antitrust counterclaims. On 28 June 2022 the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed all claims and counterclaims pending in the case with prejudice, pursuant to a joint stipulation of dismissal filed by the parties.

## Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

Norfloxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfloxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfloxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specified product" and fix the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notification and designated Norfloxacin as a "specified product" and fixed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company filed a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fixing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favor of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company filed a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by filing a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfloxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fixed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company filed a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defence against the demand.

For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company filed an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA filed a counter affidavit stating that the inclusion of Norfloxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the field. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfloxacin as a "specified product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fixing of prices for Norfloxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfloxacin was filed by the Company with the Delhi High Court. In addition, the Company have filed writ petitions challenging the inclusion and designation of Theophylline/Doxofylline, Cloxacillin and Ciprofloxacin as "specified product" as per DPCO 1995 and the related Demand Notices issued thereunder. The matters are tagged along with the Norfloxacin matter and have been adjourned to 12 July 2023 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifications regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, filed a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifications issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court

Contingent liabilities and commitments

dismissed the writ petition filed by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifications/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notified maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA filed an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application filed by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA filed a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had filed, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company filed a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the

Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to file a final counter affidavit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company coul d fil e a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter affidavit was filed by the Union of India. The Company subsequently filed a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 25 May 2023 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 395 under "Selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Other product and patent related matters

Child resistant packaging matter complaint under the False Claims Act ("FCA")

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged in a letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the "CPSA") and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the "PPPA") and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Specifically, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certificates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC's allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") began to investigate a sealed complaint which was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania ("Court") under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") related to these same issues (the "FCA Complaint"). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation filed a notice of declination stating each would not intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the Company, proceeded without the DOJ's and applicable States' involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company's generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company filed its response to the plaintiff's FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and allowing the plaintiffs one more chance to refile this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments

On 29 March 2017, the plaintiffs filed their final amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

The parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ's office in Washington, D.C. in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ relates to five of the blister pack products.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for a civil penalty of US$5 million ( ' 319), and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the Company has not admitted any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

During the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

In June 2018, the plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. During the three months ended September 2018, the plaintiffs and the DOJ settled and thus this appeal was dismissed. The plaintiffs then filed an application for recovery of attorneys' fees from the Company under the "alternative remedy doctrine." The Company made opposing filings to this and in response the plaintiffs withdrew their application.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the FCA Complaint is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements.

## Namenda Litigation

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health & Welfare Fund ("Sergeants") filed suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the Alzheimer's drug Namenda® (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009 until 2010. Sergeants seeks to represent a class of "end payor" purchasers of Namenda® tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding Namenda® tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator's attempt to shift sales from the original immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product.

On 23 August 2020, the Company and certain other defendants entered into a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement calls for the dismissal with prejudice of the claims brought by the plaintiff on behalf of the putative class, in exchange for the payment of US$0.4 million. The Company paid that amount into escrow. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement on 5 October 2020. The settlement agreement explicitly disclaims any liability or wrongdoing.

Following the settlement agreement, the Company recognised such amount in the consolidated statement of profit and loss for the three months ended 30 September 2020.

The Court granted final approval of the settlement by order dated 23 March 2023.

On 5 November 2019 plaintiffs MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC filed suit against the Company and other drug manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The claims in this complaint were similar in nature to the claims in the Sergeants lawsuit, and those cases were coordinated for discovery purposes. On 14 April 2020, with the consent of the Company and the other defendants, plaintiffs MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice.

Other class action complaints containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint have also been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. However, apart from the Sergeants case described above, there are no such class actions that are pending and that name the Company as a defendant.

In addition, the State of New York filed an antitrust case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set forth in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability, apart from the settlement payment described above, that may arise on account of alleged violation of federal antitrust laws is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated financial statements.

Ranitidine recall and litigation

On 1 October 2019, the Company initiated a voluntary nationwide recall (at the retail level for over-the-counter products and at the consumer level for prescription products) of its ranitidine medications sold in the United States due to the presence of N-Nitrosodimethylamine ("NDMA") above levels established by the U.S. FDA. On 1 November 2019, the U.S. FDA issued a statement indicating that it had found levels of NDMA in ranitidine from its testing generally that were "similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats." See https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-new-testingresults-including-low-levels-impurities-ranitidine-drugs . On 1 April 2020, the U.S. FDA issued a press release announcing that it was requesting manufacturers to withdraw all prescription and over-the-counter ranitidine drugs from the market immediately. See https:// www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-requests-removal-all-ranitidine-products-zantac-market .

Individual federal court personal injury lawsuits, as well as various class actions, were transferred to the In re Zantac (Ranitidine) Products Liability Litigation Multidistrict Litigation in the Southern District of Florida, MDL-2924 ("MDL-2924"). The Company and/ or one or more of its U.S. subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in over 3,620 lawsuits in MDL-2924. Approximately 3,000 of those cases have been filed since the MDL-2924 Court's Daubert ruling which triggered a deadline for filings by claimants in the census registry who agreed to file their lawsuits in federal court. The census registry established in MDL-2924 included tens of thousands of claimants who did not file complaints but preserved claims against the many pharmaceutical manufacturer, distributor and retailer defendants in MDL-2924. In August of 2022, the defendants exited all registry plaintiffs alleging non-designated cancers (i.e. types of cancers that are not being pursued by plaintiffs' leadership in the MDL-2924) and all registry plaintiffs alleging designated cancers who did not commit to filing a complaint in federal court. As a result, state court filings commenced. MDL-2924 also involves a proposed nationwide consumer class action and a proposed nationwide class action for medical monitoring. A third-party payor class action was dismissed without prejudice. On 7 November 2022, that dismissal was affirmed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

On 31 December 2020, the MDL-2924 Court ruled on multiple motions to dismiss in MDL-2924 and granted the generic manufacturers' (the Company is a generic manufacturer) motion to dismiss based on federal preemption. The plaintiffs' failure-to-warn and design defect claims against the Company were dismissed with prejudice, but the Court permitted plaintiffs to attempt to replead several claims/theories. Plaintiffs filed their amended complaints and the defendants, including the Company, filed motions to dismiss seeking dismissal of all claims against them on 24 March 2021. On 8 July 2021, the Court dismissed all claims, including the proposed nationwide consumer class action and proposed nationwide class action for medical monitoring against the Company and other generic manufacturers with prejudice based on federal preemption. The MDL-2924 Court's dismissal decisions have been piecemeal appealed by plaintiffs to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, resulting in at least four rounds of appeals. Motions to dismiss rounds two and three of plaintiffs' appeals have been filed, but no merits briefing or oral argument has yet occurred. In addition, rounds two and three of plaintiffs' appeals were stayed in light of the bankruptcy proceedings involving co-defendant Par Pharmaceutical (a subsidiary of Endo). Plaintiffs sought relief from the bankruptcy stay as to the non-debtor defendants in the second round of appeals, and the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ("11th Circuit") granted that request. However, another co-defendant, Lannett Co., recently filed bankruptcy, and the appeals remain stayed because of that entity's bankruptcy proceedings.

While the generic manufacturer defendants were previously dismissed with prejudice from MDL-2924 on federal preemption grounds, the brand manufacturer defendants were not dismissed, and therefore continued to litigate. Following substantial briefing and argument, on 6 December 2022, the MDL-2924 Court entered an Omnibus Order on All Pending Daubert Motions and Defendants' Summary Judgment Motion. In so doing, the Court granted brand defendants' motions to exclude plaintiffs' expert witnesses and entered summary judgment in favor of the brand defendants as to all claims involving bladder, esophageal, gastric, liver, and pancreatic cancers. The MDL-2924 Court then set a deadline of 12 April 2023 for plaintiffs to identify whether they plan to provide general causation expert reports as to any non-designated cancers. In addition, the MDL-2924 Court issued an order to show cause why summary judgment should not be entered for designated cancers as to all defendants and an order to show cause why summary judgment should not be entered against all plaintiffs for designated cancers, regardless of the date the case was filed. Briefing on the show cause orders took place in April 2023.

Several ranitidine-related actions are currently pending against the Company in state courts. The New Mexico State Attorney General fil ed suit against the Company's U.S. subsidiary, and multiple other manufacturers and retailers. The State of New Mexico asserted claims of statutory and common law public nuisance and negligence against the Company. The Company joined in an effort to transfer the case from the Santa Fe County Court to MDL-2924, but the case was remanded by the MDL-2924 Court to the Santa Fe County Court. Plaintiff filed an amended complaint on 16 April 2021. The defendants' motions to dismiss, including the Company's federal preemption motion to dismiss, were denied. The case is currently in the discovery stage. Trial has been scheduled on or after

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments

15 September 2025. In November 2020, the City of Baltimore filed a similar action against the Company's U.S. subsidiary, and multiple other manufacturers and retailers. The City of Baltimore asserted public nuisance and negligence claims against the Company. The City of Baltimore action also was transferred to MDL-2924 and subsequently was remanded to the Circuit Court of Maryland. The City of Baltimore filed an amended complaint, which the defendants moved to dismiss. The Company's federal preemption motion to dismiss was granted in February 2022 and it is not currently a defendant in the case. In January 2021, the Company was served in a Proposition 65 case filed by the Center for Environmental Health ("CFEH") in the Superior Court of Alameda County, California. The plaintiff purports to bring the case on behalf of the people of California and alleges that the Company violated Proposition 65, a California law requiring manufacturers to disclose the presence of carcinogens in consumer products. The Company and other defendants filed demurrers (motions to dismiss) in the case, and on 7 May 2021 the Court granted the generic manufacturer defendants' demurrers without leave to amend the pleadings. CFEH appealed that decision and appellate briefing is completed. Oral argument took place on 1 March 2023. On 9 March 2023, the appellate court affirmed dismissal of the generic manufacturer defendants. The plaintiff is seeking appellate review from the California Supreme Court.

As mentioned, a large number of claimants were exited from the MDL-2924 census registry by the defendants. As a result, more than 360 plaintiffs have filed suit against the Company in California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania state courts. More state court filings could follow. The California cases were filed in Alameda County and will be transferred to the existing Judicial Council Coordination Proceedings ("JCCP") (which has been pending for years with respect to the brand defendants). The Illinois cases have been filed in Madison, St. Clair, and Cook Counties and have been consolidated for pretrial purposes in Cook County. Trial dates have been established in eight Cook County cases in which the Company is named as a defendant. Those trials are set for 25 April 2024, 5 June 2024, 19 July 2024, 23 October 2024, 18 November 2024, 16 January 2025, 10 February 2025, and 20 February 2025. Plaintiffs may seek additional trial settings. The Pennsylvania cases were filed in Philadelphia County and are consolidated in the Philadelphia Complex Litigation Center. The New York cases were filed in New York and Suffolk Counties, and consolidated in New York County. Generally, they allege, among other things, failure to warn, design defect and negligence. The defendants have moved, or intend to move, to dismiss these cases. The New Jersey cases were filed in Middlesex County, but were voluntarily dismissed as to the generic defendants on 23 March 2023.

The Company believes that all of the aforesaid complaints and asserted claims are without merit and it denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable at this time. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements of the Company.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were filed against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifically, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plaintiffs in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plaintiffs' right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were filed against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multi product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fix prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice.

Contingent liabilities and commitments

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company filed a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plaintiffs filed opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was filed by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company denies any wrongdoing, believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements.

## Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") filed a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafil (a patented compound) and an udenafil finished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and finished dosage forms of udenafil and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the filing of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. The Company filed a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of said denial was also denied. The case is continuing in pretrial discovery.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated financial statements.

## Civil Litigation and Arbitration with Hatchtech Pty Limited

On 7 September 2015, the Company's Swiss subsidiary, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, S.A., entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA") with Hatchtech Pty Limited ("Hatchtech"). Pursuant to the APA, the Company's subsidiary acquired from Hatchtech the patented product Xeglyze®, a topical lousicidal lotion for the treatment of head lice, and all rights in the product. The APA provides that the Company would seek to obtain New Drug Application ("NDA") approval from the U.S. FDA, and would then commercialize the product in the United States. The APA specifies certain milestone payments to be paid by the Company's Swiss subsidiary to Hatchtech, including a US$20 million NDA approval milestone payment, a US$25 million ovicidal label approval milestone payment, and certain net sales milestone payments.

On 27 July 2020, the Company received the NDA approval from the U.S. FDA for the Xeglyze® product.

On 25 September 2020, the Company's Swiss subsidiary filed an action in Delaware Chancery Court against Hatchtech to rescind the APA based upon claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentations and mutual mistake in connection with the acquisition of the product Xeglyze®, which was dismissed as being untimely under the Delaware statute of limitations.

On 8 October 2020, Hatchtech filed an arbitration demand against the Swiss subsidiary before the American Arbitration Association, International Center for Dispute Resolution ("AAA-ICDR"), in New York City, claiming that it was owed US$20 million for the NDA approval milestone and US$25 million for the ovicidal label approval milestone.

On 25 January 2021, the Company's Swiss subsidiary filed a Writ of Summons and Statement of Claim in Victoria at Melbourne, Australia, against Hatchtech (as a nominal party), certain of its officers and a principal shareholder, alleging misrepresentations in connection with the acquisition of the Xeglyze® product and seeking damages and other relief.

Based on its best estimate, the Company had recorded a provision for potential liability of US$20 million relating to the AAA-ICDR arbitration filed by Hatchtech and believed that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise pursuant to that arbitration to be not probable.

## 2.33 Contingent liabilities and commitments

On 14 June 2021, the Company received the arbitration decision and an award was issued by the AAA-ICDR in favor of Hatchtech in an amount of US$46.25 million towards milestone payments, interest and fees.

Of the total amount of US$46.25 million awarded to Hatchtech, the amount of US$45 million ( ' 3,291) was recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss under the heading "Impairment of non-current assets" and the balance of US$1.25 million ( ' 91) was recognised under the heading, "Selling and other expenses".

On 2 February 2022, the Company and Hatchtech entered into a Global "Settlement and Transfer Agreement" dated 2 February 2022 pursuant to which the APA and all other agreements between the Company and Hatchtech were terminated, the pending litigation in Australia was dismissed with prejudice, the Company and Hatchtech exchanged mutual general releases of all claims that they had or may have against each other, and the Company transferred the Xeglyze® product (and all patents and intellectual property relating to the Xeglyze® product) back to Hatchtech for the sum of US $1 million which Hatchtech paid and the Company received on 15 February 2022.

## Securities Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Officer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public filings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws, and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were affected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 25 June 2018, the plaintiffs filed an opposition to the motion to dismiss and, on 25 July 2018, a further reply in support of the motion to dismiss was filed by the Company. In August 2018, oral argument on the motion to dismiss was heard by the Court.

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the Court dismissed the plaintiffs claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions. On 15 May 2020, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., and certain of the Company's current or former directors and officers have entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the "Stipulation") with lead plaintiff the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi in the putative securities class action filed against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. As consideration for the settlement of the class action, the Company has agreed to pay US$9 million.

The settlement is subject to the approval of the court and may be terminated prior to court approval pursuant to the grounds for termination set forth in the Stipulation. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the settlement consideration, the lead plaintiff and members of the settlement class who do not opt-out of this settlement would release, among other things, the claims that were asserted, or that they could have asserted, in this class action. In entering into the settlement, the defendants do not admit, and explicitly deny, any liability or wrongdoing of any kind.

Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, the settlement resolves the remainder of the litigation.

As the Company is adequately insured with respect to the aforesaid liability, the settlement did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statement of profit and loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

The amount payable to the plaintiffs on account of the settlement and the corresponding receivable from the insurer have been presented under "other current assets" and "other current liabilities", respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at 31 March 2020.

On 23 December 2020, the court issued a final order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement/court order, the escrow was funded on 4 January 2021. The effective date of the settlement occurred on 1 February 2021, upon transfer of the settlement fund balance into the final escrow account. As the transfer of funds to the final escrow account constitutes settlement of liability, the amount of liability has been derecognised during the year ended 31 March 2021.

## Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollaram and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effluents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fixed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee.

The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgment dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently filed a review petition against the judgment on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgment dated 16 November 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company filed an appeal challenging this judgment.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgment in July 2018 and directed the respondents to fil e their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents filed counter affidavits and the matter has now been adjourned for final hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing. The Hon'ble High Court has closed the matter in June 2022, by granting liberty for the Company to take proper recourse for remedies available under the NGT Act, 2010 before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgment of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued GO.Ms. No. 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded fiscal year, i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019.

During the three months ended September 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") has issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated 24 October 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of such affected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram. The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application filed by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5 % as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated 3 August 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G.O.Ms No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and basis the judgment of NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017 for the fiscal years 2015-2016 to 2018-2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2, CTO-3 and CTO-5 of the Company.

Contingent liabilities and commitments

On 22 November 2019, The Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued an Interim Order which stayed the demand on the condition that the Company deposit ' 60 as the remediation fee for the fiscal year 2018-2019 payable in the fiscal year 2019-2020. The deposit of ' 60 was made and the Interim Order is continuing. The Hon'ble High Court has disposed the matter with a liberty to the Company to approach NGT, if necessary.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners that was pending in the National Green Tribunal, (the "NGT"), Delhi.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the NGT. Importantly, the notification directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to the point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notification that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

The appeals filed by Mr. K. Chidambaram against the Orders of the Appellate Authority, Andhra Pradesh are disposed as the same do not survive for consideration as the G.O. based on which the then APPCB had passed its order which was subject matter of appeal before the Appellate Authority has itself been amended vide order 25 July 2013. However, the NGT, Delhi has passed a direction for the issue of pollution to be considered by the Joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Institute ("NEERI"), and the Telangana State Pollution Control Board to ascertain the present status of pollution issues in the Medak, Ranga Reddy, Mahaboobnagar and Nalagonda districts in the State of Telangana particularly in the Patancheru and Bollaram industrial clusters and file a report within three months before the NGT, Delhi.

## Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions filed by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges.

However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional financial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition filed by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 51 as at 31 March 2023 and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the ongoing litigation is not probable.

## Notices from Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax, India

In January 2020, the Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax, India issued notices alleging that the Company has improperly availed input tax credit of ' 307. The Company then received order from the Additional Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax in favor of the Company right to claim such input tax credit. Subsequently the tax authorities filed an appeal against the favorable order before the Commissioner of Goods and Services Tax (Appeals). Commissioner of Goods and Service Tax (Appeals) passed an order rejecting the Company's right to claim such input tax credit availment. The Company has filed an Appeal against such order before Hon'ble High Court of Telangana. The Company believes that it has correctly distributed and availed the input tax credit within the provisions of the applicable Act and hence no additional liability will accrue in this regard.

With reference to availment of input tax credit relating to education cess, the Company has received order with tax demand of ' 31 from the Goods and Service Tax ("GST") authorities of various states pursuant to which it has recorded a provision of ' 31 as of 31 March 2023.

## Other indirect tax related matters

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 463. The Company has responded to such demand notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated financial statements as at 31 March 2023.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse effect on its consolidated financial statements.

The total goodwill of ' 260 consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the acquired business, together with the value of the workforce acquired. This goodwill has been assigned to the Company's Global Generics segment.

The amount of revenue and loss pertaining to the acquired business was not material for the year ended 31 March 2023.

## 2.39 Impact of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine

The Company considered the uncertainty relating to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine in assessing the recoverability of receivables, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. The outcome of the war is difficult to predict, and it could have an adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment. Management has considered all potential impacts of the war including adherence of global sanctions and other restrictive measures against Russia and any retaliatory actions taken by Russia. For this purpose, the Company considered internal and external sources of information up to the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements.

The Company's supply chain has been impacted primarily in Russia and Ukraine, both in terms of higher freight costs and increase in the lead time by suppliers to deliver products. However, the Company has been able to service its customers without any significant shortages or disruptions. The Company based on its judgments, estimates and assumptions including sensitivity analysis, expects to fully recover the carrying amount of receivables, inventory, goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets. Accordingly, during the year ended 31 March 2023, the impact of this conflict on the Company's operations and financial condition was not material. The Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions.

## INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT

## Introduction

DNV represented by DNV Business Assurance India Private Limited ('DNV'), has been commissioned by the Management of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ('Dr. Reddy's' or 'the Company', Corporate Identity Number (CIN) L85195TG1984PLC004507) to undertake an independent assurance of the Company's Integrated Report 2022-23 in its online and printed format ('the Report'). The disclosures in this Report have been prepared by the Company based on the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the International <IR> Framework ('<IR> Framework') of the International Integrated Reporting Council ('IIRC') and using selected topic-specific Standards from the Global Reporting Initiative's (GRI's) Sustainability Reporting Standards 2021 ('GRI Standards') to bring out the Company's sustainability performance during the reporting period 1st April 2022 to 31st March 2023. The disclosures in this Report have been mapped based on the requirements of SEBI Circular no. SEBI/HO/CFD/CMD-2/P/CIR/2021/562 dated May 10, 2021, prescribing format of the BRSR and the guidance notes and the nine principles of the National Guidelines on Responsible Business Conduct, 2019 ('NGRBC') of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India. The intended user of this assurance statement is the Management of Dr. Reddy's ('the Management'). Our assurance engagement was planned and carried out during March 2023 - June 2023.

## Responsibilities of the Management of Dr. Reddy's and of the Assurance Provider

The Management of the Company has the sole responsibility for the preparation of the Report and are responsible for all information disclosed in the Report as well as the processes for collecting, analyzing and reporting the information presented in the printed Report. Dr. Reddy's is also responsible for ensuring the maintenance and integrity of its website and referenced disclosures on sustainability performance. In performing this assurance work, DNV's responsibility is to the Management of the Company; however, this statement represents our independent opinion and is intended to inform the outcome of the assurance to the stakeholders of Dr. Reddy's.

We provide a range of other services to the Company, none of which in our opinion, constitute a conflict of interest with this assurance work. Our assurance engagements are based on the assumption that the data and information provided by the Company to us as part of our review have been provided in good faith and are free from misstatements.

## Scope, Boundary and Limitations

The reporting scope and boundary encompasses economic, social and governance performance of Dr. Reddy's operations where the Company exercises operational control (product manufacturing operations and research and development facilities) located in India, the United Kingdom, Mexico, the Netherlands, and the United States of America, and is as brought out in the Report in the section 'About this Report' for the activities undertaken by the Company during the financial year April 1, 2022 - March 31, 2023. The boundary excludes the performance of subsidiaries and joint ventures, which are primarily related to marketing activities.

We performed a limited level of assurance based on our assurance methodology VeriSustain TM1 . The assurance engagement considers an uncertainty of ±5% based on materiality threshold for estimation/measurement errors and omissions. We did not engage with any external stakeholders as part of this assurance engagement.

During the assurance process, we did not come across limitations to the scope of the agreed assurance engagement. The reported data on economic performance, expenditure towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities, and other financial data are based on audited financial statements issued by the Company's statutory auditors which is subject to a separate audit process. We were not involved in the review of financial information within the Report.

## Basis of our Opinion

As part of the assurance process, a multi-disciplinary team of sustainability specialists performed assurance work for selected sample sites of Dr. Reddy's. We adopted a risk-based approach, that is, we concentrated our assurance efforts on the issues of high material relevance to the Company's business and its key stakeholders. We undertook onsite & remote audits with sampled operations and the Company's Corporate Office in Hyderabad, India in line with DNV's assessment methodology. We carried out the following activities:

-  Reviewed the Company's approach to addressing the reporting requirements of <IR> Framework including stakeholder engagement and its materiality determination process;
-  Reviewed disclosures related to value creation as per the <IR> Framework and claims made in the Report, and assessed the robustness of related management systems, data accuracy, information flow and controls for the reported disclosures;
-  Interviews with selected senior managers responsible for management of sustainability issues and review of selected evidence to support topics disclosed in the Report. We were free to choose interviewees and interviewed those with overall responsibility to deliver the Company's sustainability objectives.
-  Onsite verification at sample Chemical Technical Operations (CTOs), Formulations Technical Operations (FTOs), Integrated Product Development Organisations (IPDOs) and Research and Development (R&D) Centres, that is, CTO-6 and FTO PU2 in Pyidibhimavaram, CTO-5 in Miryalaguda, CTO-2 at Bollaram, APSL R&D Center in Bangalore in India. We have conducted remote assessment for the FTO operations at Middleburg, to review processes and systems for preparing site level sustainability data and implementation of sustainability strategy. We were free to choose sites for conducting our assessments on the basis of their materiality.
-  Reviewed the process of reporting on Organizational Profile, Strategy, Ethics and Integrity, Governance, Stakeholder Engagement and Reporting Practices based on GRI Standard 2: General Disclosures 2021.
-  Reviewed the performance disclosure of identified material topics and related GRI Standards; that is, carried out an assessment of the processes for gathering and consolidating performance data related to identified material topics and, for a sample, checked the processes of data consolidation to assess the Reliability and Accuracy of performance disclosures reported based on GRI's Topic-specific Standards.
-  Verification of the data consolidation of reported performance disclosures in context to the Principle of Completeness as per VeriSustain for a limited level of verification.
-  Reviewed policies related to identified sustainability issues of the organisation and their effectiveness.
-  Reviewed the process of reporting on BRSR requirements including Section A: General Disclosures, Section B: Management and Process Disclosures, and Section C: Principle-wise Performance Disclosures.

## Opinion and Observations

On the basis of the verification undertaken, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Report does not properly describe Dr. Reddy's adherence to the Guiding Principles and Content Elements of the <IR> Framework including representation of the material topics, business model, disclosures on value creation related strategies and management approach, and GRI topic-specific Standards chosen related to the material topics identified by Dr. Reddy's to bring out its performance against its identified material topics.

Without affecting our assurance opinion, we provide the following observations against the principles of VeriSustain:

## Materiality

The process of determining the issues that is most relevant to an organization and its stakeholders. The Report presents the materiality assessment process carried out by the Company and review of material topics for this year. It includes engagement of key stakeholders and assessment of its key issues towards long-term value creation during the reporting period, as well as determination of strategic focus areas for its business. The process has considered the GRI Standards, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board Materiality (SASB) standards and topics identified by peers, as well as the key expectations of internal and external stakeholders.

Nothing has come to our attention to suggest that the Report does not meet the requirements related to the Principle of Materiality .
