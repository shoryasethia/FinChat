## Letter from the Chairman and Co-Chairman

<!-- image -->

## Dear Shareholder,

Let us begin with your company's performance in FY2018.

- Consolidated revenues were at ' 142 billion, which was ~1% more compared to the previous year.
- Consolidated gross profi t was ' 76.3 billion, or 2.6% less vis-Ã -vis the previous fi nancial year.
- The gross profi t margin was 53.7%, versus 55.6% in FY2017.
- EBITDA reduced to ' 24.1 billion, a fall of 5.5% compared to the previous year.
- Profi t before taxes (PBT) was ' 14.3 billion, compared to ' 14.7 billion in the previous year.
- Profi t after taxes (PAT) was ' 9.8 billion, versus ' 12 billion in FY2017.

Frankly, these are disappointing results - especially coming after a fi nancially diffi cult year in FY2017.

Last year, we described the reasons for your company's unfortunate performance as the consequence of a 'perfect storm' when a host of negative factors simultaneously came into play. We had then hoped that some of the dark clouds would disappear and make way for better performance in FY2018. Unfortunately, that has not happened. It is important to highlight the negative factors.

First, the US market, which accounts for 52% of your company's global generics sales and 42% of all sales, continued to witness further consolidation of sales channels, which has given the fewer big US buyers even greater pricing power. The negative price effects of substantial channel consolidation have been further aggravated by intense price competition among multiple suppliers for each generic product. Over the last three years, the average price decline for generic drugs in the USA has not only been high, but has also signifi cantly increased in every passing year. Moreover, growing competition from various international suppliers has made it very diffi cult, if not impossible, to overcome the price fall by volume increases. These factors are not unique to Dr. Reddy's. They have negatively affected all major pharmaceutical companies exporting to the USA.

Second, we have been affected by regulatory interventions, especially from the USA. As you know, in November, 2015, the USFDA issued a warning letter regarding three plants: an API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda (Telangana), another API plant at Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh), and an oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, near Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh).

In consultation with international experts and the USFDA, your company has continuously worked on instituting corrective and preventive actions across

<!-- image -->

these three sites and has had follow-up meetings with the regulator. The USFDA re-inspected these facilities during February-April, 2017. Based on their observations, further corrective actions were undertaken, and such information was shared with the regulator. Post this inspection, Miryalaguda API manufacturing facility received an EIR indicating closure of the audit. However for the other two plants, there is no change in status vis-a-vis the USFDA.

Consequently, launches of key molecules, injectables, as well as certain APIs from these sites have been delayed. Although your company has successfully secured regulatory and customer approvals to transfer the production of some of these products to alternative facilities, the outcome has been a signifi cant loss of revenue from the USA for both FY2017 and FY2018.

There was also a regulatory hiccup when the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) of Germany audited your company's formulation unit 2 (FTO-2) at Bachupally, Hyderabad (Telangana). This resulted in the good manufacturing practices (GMP) compliance certifi cate not being renewed in August, 2017. Corrective work was immediately undertaken. After a follow-up audit, the GMP non-compliance status was withdrawn in January, 2018. However, stoppage in sale to Europe for four months led to lesser revenues. Thankfully, this is over, and we expect to increase sales in FY2019.

Third, during India's transition to the GST regime from 1 July 2017, your company's performance was impacted due to reduction in channel inventory and absorption of higher tax on drugs that were not in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). Moreover, price controls under India's drug price control orders affected revenue across selected products. As a result, sales performance in India was more muted than it should have been.

## WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

Regarding pricing pressures in the USA, it is diffi cult to predict how long these trends will last. Instead, our task should be to overcome this reality. The only way of doing so is to have a strong pipeline of diffi cult-to-manufacture complex formulations that address key therapeutic needs - one that allows us to introduce several value-added products each year, so that each such launch steps-up revenues to combat the price erosion in those products that were brought to the market earlier.

Your company has such a pipeline. In FY2018, we fi led 19 new abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and one new drug application (NDA) under 505(b)(2) route with the USFDA. As of 31 March 2018, we had 110 generic fi lings pending approval from the USFDA, comprising 107 ANDAs and three new drug applications (NDAs) fi led under the 505(b)(2) route of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Of these 107 ANDAs, 63 are Para IV applications - of which we believe 30 have 'First to File' status.

We have to match this robust pipeline by securing timely approvals from the USFDA and complement those with rapid ramp-up of production and delivery to the USA. We have to do this without fail, and with best-in-class cost of production. That is the way out.

As far as the USFDA regulatory hurdles go, your company remains fully committed to follow the highest standards of quality. We have signifi cantly enhanced quality management systems and operations,

which include improvements in rigor of investigations and document control systems, standardization of instrument calibrations, strengthening shop-fl oor level IT controls as well as shop fl oor training programs, and simplifying and standardizing standard operating procedures and batch records. We have requested the USFDA to schedule an inspection of the oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada. Hopefully, the regulator will recognize the scale and scope of improvements undertaken at the facilities and give us the green light.

There exist signifi cant opportunities in Emerging Markets, which are now on a longer-term upswing. We should be able to increase revenues from these geographies through greater sales of simple and complex generics as well as hospital and institutional sales of oncological biosimilars. There are also major prospects in key emerging markets for speciality generics and biosimilars, and your company will be doing its utmost to increase its market presence in these countries.

With the German regulatory problem behind us, we expect to increase our sales to that country as well as Romania. Moreover, having opened operations in France, Italy and Spain, we should be working on generating higher revenues from these countries, and to increase our market presence in Europe in the near future.

Relative to the competition that matters, we have underperformed in India. Your company now needs to put all its efforts in ensuring that it grows at least as fast as the market - ideally faster and achieve the kind of double-digit growths that it attained in the past. This is doable. It needs totally focused effort by the team.

After three years of lacklustre performance, the pharmaceutical services and active ingredient (PSAI) business has turned around. We expect the business to now generate double-digit growth, as it has in the past, and it surely can.

Though small, the proprietary product (PP) business has done well. The two new products that were launched in FY2017 - ZEMBRACE TM SYMTOUCH TM (a 3 mg sumatriptan injection for acute migraine) and SERNIVO TM (a betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% spray to treat mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis) have found market traction. In FY2018, the USFDA approved a third product, IMPOYZ TM (clobetasol propionate) cream. We expect to see greater revenues in the USA driven by these three products. Towards the end of the year we have fi led our lead migraine candidate DFN-02 with the USFDA.

A positive upshot of the revenue crunch in FY2017 and FY2018, has been your company's attention to costs. From the beginning of FY2018 there has been a totally focused drive on eliminating needless layers and unnecessary costs. This will continue throughout FY2019 and thereafter, with the aim to create a leaner, internationally cost-competitive and more nimble organization.

Your company's management has accepted several challenging goals for FY2019. These involve better plant management; an unwavering focus on institutionalizing best-in-class manufacturing and quality practices; bringing about greater effi ciency in R&D, product development, and speed-to-market for new products; driving hard to perform better in sales in the USA, Europe, India and the Emerging Markets; and maintaining a tight leash on costs.

We hope that these initiatives, backed by the resolve of each employee of your company, will deliver better results in FY2019. Because Dr. Reddy's and you, the shareholder, deserve it.

Thank you, as ever, for your goodwill and support.

With best regards,

## Good Health Can't Wait

At Dr. Reddy's, we are driven by our purpose of accelerating access to innovative and affordable medicines because good health can't wait. We strive to do all it takes to reach the right medicines to patients, when and where they need them. The need for affordability, better disease management and higher effi cacy are key priorities for us, and they guide our efforts across operations, supply chain, and R&D.

Patients are at the center of everything we do and the pivot around which our organizational strategy revolves. Our work around the world, be it in mature geographies or in the emerging ones, is geared towards addressing unmet patient needs and bringing expensive medicines within reach, while delivering high-quality and effi cacious drugs. We dedicate ourselves to ensure on-shelf drug availability so that no patient is denied access to the treatment they need for their good health.

## Addressing the unmet needs of patients in India

At Dr. Reddy's, we are constantly looking for opportunities that allow us to bring expensive medicines within the reach of patients who need them. In India, it came in the way of a partnership we had entered into with Amgen, and this year, patients in India had access to treatment that was till date not available in the areas of oncology, osteoporosis, and cardiology

## REPATHAÂ® - HELPING INDIAN PATIENTS BEAT CARDIAC DISEASE

India has a heavy burden of cardiac disease. According to current estimates, India will soon have the highest number of heart disease cases in the world. The Indian Heart Association stated that 50% of all heart attacks in Indians occur under 50 years of age and 25% of all heart attacks in Indians occur under 40 years of age. Managing cholesterol levels is key to controlling cardiac disease, and for the last three decades, statins have been the staple treatment globally. However, there are many patients for whom statins do not work adequately, even in the highest of doses. Their LDL-C (bad cholesterol) levels remain high, seriously affecting their quality of life.

The REPATHAÂ® (evolocumab) injection, a monoclonal antibody, reduces LDL-C levels by a much wider margin in cases where statins such as atorvastatin and rozuvastatin simply have no effect, thus setting a new benchmark in lipid control.

## DENOSUMAB - CONVENIENT AND EFFICACIOUS MANAGEMENT OF BONE MASS

Often referred to as the "silent epidemic," osteoporosis is a global issue that is increasing in prevalence as the world's population increases and ages. Women are especially vulnerable. Osteoporosis makes the bones brittle, fragile, and highly prone to fractures, which can severely impair

the patient's mobility and quality of life. Around 25% of patients who sustain a hip fracture die within a year, and only less than half of those who survive regain their previous quality of life*.

Conventionally, osteoporosis is treated using anabolics, which entails frequent injections, sometimes daily, making the treatment cumbersome. Denosumab, under the brand name PROLIAÂ®, offers a relatively safer, more convenient and more effi cacious alternative. Treatment is through a subcutaneous injection taken just once in six months. An article published by the New England Journal of Medicine states that during clinical trials, 40% of the women who were treated with PROLIAÂ®, regained their normal Bone Mass Density and had healthy bones over a period of 8-10 years.

Denosumab, under the brand name XGEVAÂ®, is used to treat cancer patients for whom the disease has spread to their bones. By effi ciently increasing bone mass, it helps them manage their condition better, and enjoy a better quality of life.

## Leveraging deep science for breaking new ground in cancer treatment

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and claims more than 8 million lives in a year. Dr. Reddy's recognized the urgency to accelerate access to cancer patients in dire need of affordable medicines and has been building its capability for the war against cancer for more than a decade.

Immuno-oncology as a treatment has been evaluated for many years, but a big breakthrough in this area has happened only over the last few years. This approach to treating cancer, aims to stimulate the patient's immune system into fi ghting cancer, as opposed to chemotherapy, which cannot accurately differentiate between cancer cells and healthy cells. This led to high collateral cell damage, and traumatic side effects, besides limited curative ability. Immuno-oncology promises more accurate targeting of cancer cells, long durations of response, fewer side effects and is the cutting edge of cancer treatment. However, these drugs are prohibitively expensive and are largely unaffordable outside the developed markets.

Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited, Dr. Reddy's wholly-owned subsidiary, has a dedicated program to discover and develop oral immune-oncology drugs. The fi rst of these, CA 170, is in clinical development at this time. Aurigene has partnered with Curis Inc. to jointly develop CA 170 for the global markets. CA 170 brings some unique features to the table that potentially can provide several treatment benefi ts, otherwise unavailable to patients.

On approval, it will be the only orally administered drug in its class, which makes it much easier to administer. Patients can consume the medication at home, and don't need professional assistance as with injectable therapies. This also potentially makes it less expensive.

CA 170 is also the only drug that targets two different immune checkpoints: PD1 and VISTA. Most other drugs in this class focus only on PD1. The expectation with the drug is to see a higher response rate compared to the other PD1 drugs, as well as a more durable response, both of which are being evaluated. The drug is also being tested as a treatment for a wide range of cancers.

Another issue in cancer treatment is toxicity. This particularly occurs in combination treatments, where the multiple drugs used may enhance the overall toxicity to the patient. CA 170 is excreted from the body in less than 24 hours and would be easier to co-administer with other drugs compared to anti-bodies, which typically last 3-4 weeks in the body.

## Accelerating access to high-quality and aff ordable biosimilars

A biologic, or a biopharmaceutical, is a medicinal product that is manufactured in, or extracted from, a living system (plant, animal or microorganism). Diseases like cancer or autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis often require the long term use of biologics. Effective as they are, biologics are also expensive and can place a signifi cant cost burden on both the patient as well as the payer.

At Dr. Reddy's, we constantly strive to bring the most advanced medicines within the reach of millions around the world. Our continuous efforts to develop and market high-quality, equally effective, but signifi cantly more affordable biosimilars* over the past 15 years is a testament to this commitment.

Our biologics development capabilities have made us a leader in the relatively small, but fast-growing biosimilars industry with four biosimilar products marketed in several countries and an extensive pipeline under development. We have proven capabilities that span the therapeutic proteins, including glycosylated proteins, monoclonal antibodies, and pegylated proteins.

In several markets, where the originator's biologic is either unavailable or largely unaffordable, Dr. Reddy's has signifi cantly expanded access to treatment through the introduction of its biosimilars. Since its inception over 400,000 patients have been treated using our biologics products.

In Peru for example, until 2008 the only rituximab available was from the originator. Since its launch in Peru in 2009, REDITUXÂ® has helped more than 13,000 patients obtain access to rituximab therapy while signifi cantly easing the burden on the country's healthcare system.

Similarly, in Sri Lanka, REDITUXÂ® has helped increase patient access by 30 times since its launch in FY2011. Where in FY2011 a mere 10-20 patients per year were being treated, in FY2017, more than 800 patients did.

In Vietnam, patient access has more than doubled since the launch of REDITUXÂ®. As against 300 patients in FY2014, more than 900 patients benefi tted from rituximab treatment in FY2017.

CRESPÂ®, Dr. Reddy's brand of darbepoetin alfa, was fi rst launched in India in 2010, with the objective of offering a convenient and affordable treatment regimen for anemia management in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients and as supportive care for patients who develop anemia as a result of myelosuppressive chemotherapy in non-myeloid malignancies. The originator product remains unavailable in India. The availability of CRESPÂ® in India has provided patients and physicians access to the multiple benefi ts of using darbepoetin alfa such as fewer injections and hence, convenience of use towards anemia management. Over the last 8 years, CRESPÂ® has helped increase patient access to darbepoetin and has been administered to more than 75,000 patients.

In the future, biologics will continue to play an increasingly crucial role in healthcare as new therapies are innovated. At Dr. Reddy's we will stay focused on our quest to develop high-quality and affordable alternatives and take them to patients who need them the most.

Our biologics development capabilities have made us a leader in the relatively small, but fast-growing biosimilars industry with four biosimilar products marketed in several countries and an extensive pipeline under development.

- * The term biosimilar product is used by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), and defi nes biosimilarity to mean that the biological product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity, and potency of the product. Regional Audit: Epidemiology, costs and burden of osteoporosis.

## Ensuring drug availability for patients in the US

Three of the products launched in the US last year illustrate our commitment towards ensuring that life-saving medicines are available where needed.

## EZETIMIBE AND SIMVASTATIN TABLETS

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 3 American adults has high cholesterol, putting them at risk for heart disease and stroke, two leading causes of death in North America. Ezetimibe and Simvastatin Tablet is a combination indicated for cholesterol management. Providing access to an affordable alternative to the innovator drug was an important mission for Dr. Reddy's.

Dr. Reddy's, having acquired the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) from TEVA in 2016, worked on the challenge of launching the generic product on the fi rst day of USFDA approval. Because there were fewer generic alternatives on the market on day one, the demand for the product was signifi cantly increased. Dr. Reddy's addressed the challenge of meeting the increased demand by actioning a ramp-up plan. This included collaborating effi ciently with the external manufacturing partner to be able to service the upsurge within highly accelerated timelines. We were able to meet almost twice the market demand than what we had originally forecast and patients did not have to face the challenge of getting access to affordable generic products that could signifi cantly impact their lives.

## DOXORUBICIN HYDROCHLORIDE LIPOSOME INJECTION

Patients suffering from ovarian cancer and AIDS related kaposi sarcoma, who no longer respond to chemotherapy with other drugs, may gain an extended lease of life if treated with Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome Injection. However, the constrained supply of the drug in the market led to limited access, which also made the drug much more expensive for critically ill patients. We identifi ed and collaborated with a partner whose capabilities complemented ours and secured the USFDA approval for this complex drug that is not easy to manufacture.

The challenges, however, did not end there. This was our fi rst product that needed cold-chain shipping. Our Supply Chain team responded with agility, mastering the complexities of cold-chain shipping in record time. We won our fi rst fi ve-year award from one of the largest group purchasing organizations for hospitals in North America and closed a deal with a leading pharmaceutical distribution company in the country. At every step, we acted quickly to get this generic oncology product in the hands of hospitals for cancer patients in need.

## SEVELAMER CARBONATE

Sevelamer carbonate is used by kidney dialysis clinics across the US. The drug is a crucial element of treatment for dialysis patients. The regulatory group at Dr. Reddy's worked closely with the USFDA and ensured that Dr. Reddy's was among the fi rst few companies to receive an approval for the generic product in the fi rst wave, thus addressing the urgent need to launch the product faster in the market.

What makes this launch even more signifi cant is the fact that Dr. Reddy's launched the product despite an initial shortage in the supply of the product's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). Our Supply and Logistics teams secured a signifi cant quantity of the API that would make up for the anticipated scarcity. Through close-knit teamwork, we successfully met the urgent need for the generic alternative of sevelamer carbonate, and yet again proved our commitment to provide patients with affordable alternatives to critical drugs.

## PRINCIPLE 1

- 1. Does the policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption cover only the company? Yes/No. Does it extend to the group/joint ventures/suppliers/contractors/ NGOs/others?

## ETHICS, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

Yes. The policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption extends beyond our company employees, both whole-time and independent directors, covers the subsidiaries and affi liates of the group. While contracts with our suppliers, contractors and business partners include adherence to our principles concerning ethics, there is a separate code of conduct required to be adhered to by our suppliers and service providers.

- 2. How many stakeholder complaints have been received in the past fi nancial year and what percentage was satisfactorily resolved by the management?

We did not receive any signifi cant stak eholder complaints in the lastfi nancial year. The company has a hotline for whistle-blowers and receiving concerns. The concerns received are dealt with according to the company's ombudsperson policy. We did not receive any

signifi cant complaint from any external stakeholder in the last fi nancial year.

## PRINCIPLE 2

- 1. List up to three of your products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/or opportunities.

## PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY

- i. ROXADUSTAT
- iii. Sustainable packaging initiative
- ii. Metoprolol Succinate
- 2. For each such product, provide the following details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of product (optional):
- ii. Reduction during usage by consumers (energy, water) has been achieved since the previous year
- i. Reduction during sourcing/ production/distribution achieved since the previous year throughout the value chain
- (i) ROXADUSTAT We have continued to apply and embed 12 principles of green chemistry in our research and development

pursuits. We identifi ed a unique way of synthesis of ROXADUSTAT in which a regioselective opening of anhydride ring and Pd metal free C-C bond formation aims to develop an innovative, greener and cost effective route to meet the business needs without compromising on the environmental considerations. In this endeavor, we have reduced the E-factor substantially and quantifi cation of the actual impact is under progress.

- (ii) Reduction in excess rejection material in Metoprolol Succinate production Earlier scenario - During the production of Metoprolol Succinate, it was observed that the product contributes to 51% of total "plant solutions" rejection and that 70% of the solution rejects is from the over coating stage of the product. On an average, ~120 kgs of solution was being rejected in the over coating stage in every batch.

Improvement - To minimize the rejection material, the dispensing procedure was modifi ed in such a way that only the yield of the previous stage is considered during next stage dispensing, instead of 100% material dispensing.

Results with revised methodology:

- Eliminated the cost of disposal of hazardous waste; and
- On an average, ~120 kgs of rejected solution turned into 0 (nil). Elimination of waste and the manual effort required for waste handling;
- Cost saving of ' 65 lakhs per year accrued as a result of this initiative.

- (iii) Sustainable packaging initiative
- Earlier scenario - Inner shippers having bottle/ blister pack were further packed in to outer shipper. Presently we have eliminated the use of outer shipper by collating the inner shipper and bundled it using a carry strap. With this initiative, we have
- a. Elimination of packaging component: Outer shipper elimination of oral solid dosage products for the USA market
- Reduced usage of 2,135 tons kraft paper material which in turn reduced the generation of paper waste.
- Increased load-ability on pallet by increasing number of packs on pallet by ~20% which in turn reduced the number of pallets in consignment per batch;

Additional benefi ts realized -

- Eliminated re-packing activity at the USA warehouse; and
- Cost savings in packaging material and logistics.
- b. Replacement of plastic drum with paper fi bre drums for Omeprazole Mg DR capsules OTC bulk pack for the USA market Earlier the bulk foil pouch pack was packed in to plastic drums. Presently we are using paper fi bre board drums to pack foil pouches. With this initiative, we have:

<!-- image -->

- Reduced consumption of plastic drums by ~70 tons/ year;
- Reduced carbon foot print in transport by increasing the number of pouches per drum as well as the number of drums per pallet.
- Reduced the quantity of non-biodegradable waste as the paper fi bre drum is bio-degradable in nature; and
- c. Removal of medication guide from the product packs meant for the USA market We have eliminated the physical copy of medication guide and converted it in to e-Medguide. With this initiative, we have:
- Eliminated one extra packing process step;
- Eliminated usage of paper from the system;
- Reduced headspace inside shipper due to removal of Medguide, which resulted in increase in number of packs per shipper; and
- Reduced number of palletized consignment per batch and increased loadability on pallet.

We have undertaken several simplifi cation projects to improve our logistics in recent years. Few such initiatives are:

(TLB) To support fi nished goods distribution in India, a TLB application has been designed which tracks the stock status of materials at warehouses vis-Ã -vis the desired target stock levels and automatically prompts for stock transfer to replenish the defi cits at the sales warehouse. It minimizes the transportation costs by creating transfer proposals using the truck sizes defi ned for each transportation lane and optimizing the truck load. With this project, we are also:

- 2. Ensuring product availability;
- 1. Identifying SKU sales warehouse combinations where business is at risk of losing sales due to stock outs or low coverage;
- 3. Reducing manual intervention in the process; and
- 4. Maximizing truck loads reducing overall cost.

Air to sea shipment We are continually shifting our goods movement from air to sea to effectively reduce carbon footprint in our supply chain. In the reporting period, we have avoided 61,270 tons of carbon emission with this initiative.

- 4. Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services from local & small producers, including communities surrounding their place of work? If yes, what steps

## have been taken to improve their capacity and capability of local and small vendors?

Yes, Dr. Reddy's has procedures in place to procure goods and services from local producers.

Presently 80% of Dr. Reddy's procurements are from domestic producers and 20% from international producers.

Dedicated resources are assigned the job of improving capacity and capabilities of local producers. The following are some of the initiatives:

- Mandatory supplier trainings for new vendors; and
- Sharing good practices via audits and workshops;
- Inculcating a culture of resource conservations among local producers with regard to improved solvent recovery effi ciencies and eliminating usage of hazardous solvents.
- 5. Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and wastes? If yes, what is the percentage of recycled products and wastes.

We have ambitiously taken a target to go for zero solid waste to landfi ll by the end of 2020. For the same we have taken few initiatives to reuse/recycle the waste.

At Dr. Reddy's, total ~19,600 tons of hazardous waste was generated during the reporting period in India. Out of the total hazardous waste generated, 94.4% of the waste was sent to cement industries for co-processing thereby eliminating offsite incineration. Almost 4.1% waste was sent for recycling.

Thus, 98.5% of hazardous waste was co-processed and recycled. Our API facilities have already achieved zero solid waste to landfi ll. We at

## Health initiatives

Our health initiatives include: The Community Health Intervention Programme (CHIP) covers 145 villages of Srikakulam, Nalgonda and Vizianagaram districts. This project was started in partnership with the NICE foundation to provide primary and preventive care at the doorstep, to a large segment of rural population that do not have access to safe and reliable healthcare in the region. In FY2018, we reached out to a population of 2.15 lakhs.

- 2. Are the programmes/projects undertaken through in-house team/own foundation/external NGO/government structures/ any other organization? We engage with the community through our partners like DRF, Naandi Foundation, NICE Foundation, Agastya International Foundation and other similar organizations.

## 3. Have you done any impact assessment of your initiative?

We review our internal assessment systems and projects from time to time. Each project has specifi c deliverables against which it is measured.

- 4. What is your company's direct contribution to community development projects - Amount in INR and the details of the projects undertaken? We contributed ' 32.81 crores for community development. For details of the projects undertaken refer the projects listed in the CSR Report. Refer page no. 87-88
- 5. Have you taken steps to ensure that this community development initiative is successfully adopted by the community?

Our community development initiatives are inclusive and designed towards sustainability. We involve gram panchayat or

local government in the project development discussions.

For education programmes, we encourage the participation of parents in the school management committee (SMC) meetings, in which even local leaders participate, to instill ownership. mandal education offi cer (MEO) on quarterly basis reviews the school performance. Youth participating in the vocational skills enhancing programmes, pay a small percentage of the course fees. For health programme, local panchayat and villagers were involved right at the beginning. Villagers and local government authorities have given space for running out patient (OP) wards and benefi ciaries i.e. the community members are given the responsibility of running the OP and scheduling the patients. Patients are showing positive attitude towards minimal contribution sought from them for rendering medical services at their door steps. For other community development initiatives as well, we engage the local authorities whose active involvement encourages participation and ownership from the community members. To elaborate, in case of Gundlapally Lake Revival initiative, the involvement of the District Administrator resulted in greater participation from the villagers. The villagers not only supported in the revival but also committed to protect the lake further.

FY2018 has been a diffi cult year for the company, largely on account of two factors. The extremely diffi cult market conditions in the US were exacerbated by intense price competition and channel consolidation. The other roadblock was the inability to supply key molecules to the US because of three plants being issued warning letters by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in November 2015 - a matter that is yet to be resolved till date. But before delving into these and other details, it is useful to highlight the company's key consolida ted fi nancial results for FY2018.

As is evident, the company's fi nancial performance has been muted in FY2018. This was on account of the following factors.

- 1. Price erosion and channel consolidation in the US: As in the preceding year, the US market saw further consolidation of sales channels that have continued to give the buyers even greater pricing power. This has affected all major pharmaceutical companies exporting to the US, and Dr. Reddy's is no exception. The effects of channel consolidation have been aggravated by intense price competition among multiple suppliers for each generic pharmaceutical product. This, too, was an industry-wide trend affecting all suppliers of generic drugs in the US.
- 2. Regulatory consequences, USFDA: As known by shareholders and analysts, in November 2015, the USFDA issued warning letters regarding three plants - an API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda (Telangana), another API plant at Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh), and an oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada near Visakhapatnam (Andhra Pradesh). Pending resolution of the issues identifi ed in the letters, the USFDA withheld approval of new products from these facilities. Since then, Dr. Reddy's, in consultation with international specialists and the USFDA, has continuously worked on instituting corrective and preventive actions across these three sites and had follow-up meetings with the regulator. The USFDA re-inspected these facilities during February-April 2017. Based on their observations,

- further corrective actions were undertaken, information on which was shared with the regulator. As of date, the API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda has received an EIR, offi cially closing the audit. However for the remaining two sites there is no change in status vis-Ã -vis the USFDA. Thus, launches of some key molecules, injectables as well as certain APIs from these sites have been delayed. Although the company has successfully secured regulatory and customer approvals to transfer the production of some of these products to alternative facilities, the consequence has been a signifi cant loss of revenue opportunity from the US for both FY2017 and FY2018. The USFDA issue is discussed in further detail in a later section of this chapter.
- 3. Regulatory consequences, German audit: The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) of Germany audited the company's formulation unit 2 (FTO-2) at Bachupally, Hyderabad (Telangana). This resulted in non-renewal of the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance certifi cate in August 2017. After a follow-up audit, the GMP non-compliance status was withdrawn in January 2018. However, it caused a four month hiatus in sale in Europe in FY2018.
- 4. Effects of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) implementation in India and price controls under the Drug Price Control Order (DPCO): India transitioned to the GST regime on 1 July 2017. The company's performance was impacted due to reduction in channel inventory and absorption of higher tax on drugs that are not in the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM).

Moreover, price controls under the DPCO also affected revenue across selected products. As a result, the sales performance in India was muted than it ought to have been.

## A SNAPSHOT OF PERFORMANCE GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

- Revenue from North America Generics was ' 59.8 billion, a decline of 6% versus FY2017. This was largely due to signifi cant adverse price erosion witnessed in some key molecules, such as Azacitidine, Decitabine, Valgancyclovir, and Esomeprazole DR. As explained earlier, the price erosion was due to increased competitive intensity coupled with channel consolidation that led to higher purchasing power in the hands of the limited number of buyers. This decline was partly offset by new products launched during the year and the full-year impact of products launched during the previous year;
- Revenue from GG in FY2018 was ' 114 billion, representing a decline of 1% compared to the previous year. This was primarily on account of lower contribution from North America and lower than usual growth witnessed in the India business;
- During the year, Dr. Reddy's launched 15 new products in North America - the major ones being Liposomal Doxorubicin, EzetimibeSimvastatin, Sevelamer, Palonosetron injection and Bivalrudin injection;
- Revenue from Europe was ' 8.2 billion, representing a growth of 8% versus FY2017. As mentioned earlier, the growth would have been higher had we not faced temporary supply restrictions due to the BfArM audit of FTO-2. This matter has been satisfactorily resolved;
- In FY2018, we fi led 19 new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and one New Drug Application (NDA) with the USFDA. As of 31 March 2018, we had 110 generic fi lings pending approval from the USFDA, comprising 107 ANDAs and three NDAs fi led under the 505(b)(2) route of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Of the 107 ANDAs, 63 are Para IV applications, of which we believe 30 have 'First to File' status;
- Revenue from Emerging Markets was ' 22.7 billion , a growth of 8% versus FY2017. The expansion was primarily driven by new product launches and entry into new markets.
- -Revenue from other CIS countries and Romania was ' 3.9 billion, year-on-year growth of 6%; and
- -Revenue from Russia was ' 12.6 billion , year-on-year growth of 9%;
- -Revenue from Rest of the World (RoW) territories was ' 6.1 billion, year-on-year growth of 5%.
- Revenue from India was ' 23.3 billion, a growth of 1% versus FY2017. As mentioned earlier, the growth was muted due to channel de-stocking witnessed during the transition to the GST regime, impact due to higher tax rate, and the fact that the indirect tax component is no longer included in gross sales. Adjusted for these transition-related impacts, the business grew by 8%, thanks to volume uptake and new products launched during the year.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

- Revenues from PSAI stood at ' 22.0 billion, representing a growth of 3% versus FY2017. During the year, we fi led 73 Drug Master Files (DMFs) worldwide.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

- Revenue from PP was ' 4.2 billion. This included a milestone payment of ' 1.5 billion from Encore Dermatology Inc. as part of the out-licensing agreement pertaining to IMPOYZâ¢ (clobetasol propionate) cream 0.025%, which was approved by the USFDA during the year.

## GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET OUTLOOK

2017 saw several structural changes such as the implementation of the GST regime in India, corporate tax reforms in the US and the European Union (EU) shifting the headquarters of its European Medicines Agency (EMA) from London to Amsterdam. Besides these, the pharmaceutical industry has its 'hardy perennials': ever-more stringent regulatory environments across all major geographies, price

controls, greater competition, and channel consolidation as well as geopolitical instability in some regions.

Despite these negative trends, the long-term outlook for the industry remains broadly positive. Moreover, other trends such as new gene therapies, opportunities afforded by digital health technologies, an anticipated pick-up in drug approval rates in the US, and favorable demographics are expected to provide their impetus.

According to the 2017 World Preview report of EvaluatePharmaÂ®, prescription drug and OTC sales are forecast to grow at an impressive compound annual rate of 5.4%, rising from US$ 803 billion in 2016 to US$ 1.1 trillion worldwide in 2022 1 . Much of this growth is set to come from key therapy areas such as new anti-cancer molecules, immunotherapies and orphan drugs 2 . Orphan drugs are projected to account for 32% of the increase in sales in 2022. The share of generics in total prescription drugs sale will remain relatively constant between 10.6% and 11%. Table 1 below shows the estimates of EvaluatePharmaÂ® for global prescription drug and OTC sales between 2016 and 2022.

Given below are some notable trends that are expected to have a signifi cant impact on the industry:

- Oncology will be an even greater driver of growth: As Table 1 shows, specialized medicines for the treatment of cancer was the leader in 2016, accounting for almost US$ 94 billion in sales and 11.7% of the global market share for prescription and OTC products. This trend will become even more pronounced by 2022. With a CAGR of 12%, sales of oncological drugs are expected to cross US$ 192 billion, with a market share of 17.5%. In fact, the estimated sales of oncological drugs will exceed the combined sales of the next three top therapeutic areas, namely anti-diabetics, anti-rheumatics and anti-virals.

<!-- image -->

- Orphan drugs will be an increasing trend: The orphan drug market is expected to almost double in the next fi ve years, reaching US$ 209 billion in 2022. Of the top 100 drugs in the US, the average cost per patient per year for an orphan drug was approximately fi ve times as much as a non-orphan. Three factors augur well for orphan drugs in the US. First, there has been a distinct increase in USFDA approvals of such drugs: 75 in 2017 versus 27 in 2016 and 56 in 2015. This is expected to continue. Second, while some 600 orphan drug treatments have been approved till date, over 7,000 conditions are designated as rare in the US. Hence, there is considerable scope in this area. Third, while the latest tax reforms in the US have reduced tax credits on orphan drugs from 50% to 25%, other key benefi ts remain. These are, among others, a market exclusivity for seven years, faster USFDA review, and waived fees and

- exception from the branded drug pharma fee under the Affordable Care Act.
- The biologics and biosimilars megatrend: Biologics are predicted to account for more than a quarter of the pharmaceutical market by 2020. In the US, according to the 2017 report of EvaluatePharmaÂ®, biologics is expected to contribute to over 50% of the Top 100 product sales in the US by 2022. However, with success, the industry's biggest biologics players face revenue threats from biosimilars. Lack of affordable access to biologics has created favorable tailwinds for biosimilars, especially in emerging markets. Within the EU, countries are already seeing considerable cost savings with biosimilars, typically in the range of 30% or more. As of November 2017, the EMA has approved 34 biosimilars, versus just three approvals in 2016, and the biosimilars market in Europe is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% during 2017-22. Equally so in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, where with the advent of clear approval pathways, analysts expect sales to grow at an estimated CAGR of almost 31% between 2017 and 2022. The highest impact in biosimilars sales in the US is expected in the next two years and anywhere between 25 and
- Generic drug approvals on the rise in the US: Under USFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, the agency has set a high priority to improve the generic drug review process to increase competition. In 2017, USFDA recorded its highest annual total of 1,027 generic drug approvals comprising 843 full and 184 tentative approvals. According to a recent blog by Commissioner Gottlieb, if current trends continue, the agency expects to exceed this record in 2018. Higher and faster generic drug approvals are welcome, but there is concern that the process will lead to greater price competition than hitherto witnessed in the US. Players who have superior business and go-to-market models, well-integrated operations and are better equipped in terms of quality and compliance should gain from this change.
- 35 biosimilars are expected to be in that market by 2020. However, there are still headwinds in the US without a clear regulatory pathway. As far as the developed markets are concerned, 2018 will see some US$ 19 billion of biologics facing competition from biosimilars, versus US$ 3 billion in 2017. This exposure to the biosimilars competition in 2018 is the largest single-year change to date and should signal the start of the next large wave of biosimilars. As EvaluatePharmaÂ® has observed, there will soon be a second patent cliff era with the advent of biosimilars.
- Personalized medicine expected to gain signifi cant prominence: The global personalized medicine market is forecast to grow at a
- Shift to specialty drugs: The pharmaceutical industry has in the recent past witnessed more specialty products than ever before. This has generated a wave of exciting new science that can drive profi table growth and possibly offset current and future patent expiries. Over the past few years, the shift has been clearly seen in an increased proportion of New Molecular Entity (NME) approvals in the specialty areas, plus the rise in average sales contribution of specialty NMEs. During 2008-15, the average sales of specialty NMEs in the fi rst two years post-launch increased roughly four times. This is expected to continue. Backed by a robust pipeline, the latestage industry pipeline is forecast to be a minimum of 40 NME approvals per year up to 2021. However, growth of these specialty drugs will depend upon how these could counter the affordability gap, as payers and governments persistently try and reduce healthcare costs.

CAGR of almost 12% till 2022, which will be more than double the projected annual growth for the overall healthcare sector. Growth will be driven by advancements in technology and targeted therapies that are more effi cient and can provide more value. The shift in focus on prevention and early intervention is creating the impetus for this niche segment. More than 40% of all compounds and 70% of oncology compounds have the potential to be personalized medicines. Real-time big data and Artifi cial Intelligence (AI) technologies are accelerating the development of the most fruitful molecules and compounds. As personalized medicine increasingly moves from the theoretical to the practical, life sciences companies are focusing on operationalizing the necessary shift in the business model, especially processes to manufacture, distribute, and administer treatments. The 'vein-to-vein' nature of personalized medicine will force supply chain leaders to re-conceptualize almost every aspect of the traditional operational model to account for more stringent temperature and stability controls, crunched production and delivery times, re-evaluating capacity planning, and more. The very nature of personalized medicine with impenetrable patent exclusivity represents some of the appeal for spending big on these capabilities now, if companies can afford these expenditures.

- Gene therapy - a new reality: Gene therapy will disrupt the pharmaceutical sector by offering customized, targeted patient treatment, including newly approved CAR-T cell therapies. While adoption is still low, insights from human genetics and precision medicine will increasingly transform healthcare by bringing value through innovative biotechnology. Given that approximately 80% of rare diseases are of genetic origin, gene therapy will play a signifi cant role in the treatment of such diseases. Different approaches are being explored by several pharmaceutical and biotech companies, such as the replacement of a defective gene with a healthy one, inactivation of a mutated

<!-- image -->

gene, and introduction of a new gene in the patient's body to fi ght a disease. A look at the sheer number of trials in gene therapy indicates that this will be a game changer in pharmaceuticals earlier than what most people believed.

- Convergence of IT and pharmaceuticals: On the face of it, the use of AI seems to be slower in life sciences compared to some other industries. However, the traction is improving with each day, and AI will indelibly impact the way drugs and medical devices are discovered, designed, created, distributed, and used. A growing number of global bio-pharma companies are using AI to streamline the drug discovery process. AI algorithms are being used to analyze large data sets from clinical trials, health records, genetic profi les, and preclinical studies. Patterns and trends within such big data are helping to develop hypotheses at a much faster rate than ever before. Apart from AI, other technologies such as RealWorld Evidence (RWE), robotic and cognitive automation, and cloud computing are expected to bring transformational change to R&D. These emerging technologies will improve study design, physician and patient recruitment, and in-trial

decision making, as well as increase effi ciency and accuracy in other critical tasks such as transformation in supply chain all the way through to regulatory fi ling.

- Higher and more frequent regulatory inspection on drug pricing: Increased budgetary pressure on governments to reduce their healthcare costs has and will, lead to pricing pressures. Regulators are increasingly watchful of price increases taken by pharmaceutical companies. Many global fi rms have been summoned by law makers over price increases. Reforms are being implemented, drafted, or being thought of by various countries to constrain drug prices.
- Rapid urbanization, ageing population and lifestyle diseases: By 2050, over two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities. In emerging markets, we are already witnessing what rapid and unplanned urbanization leads to uncontrollable population densities, poverty of a growing under-class, and the lack of adequate urban infrastructure. These invariably create conditions for higher incidence of communicable and epidemiological diseases, which prompt government demand for affordable anti-infective medicine and related prophylactics. Regarding ageing, the global population of 60 years and above is projected to grow by 56% to reach an estimated 1.4 billion between 2015 and 2030. By 2050, this will more than double to touch 2.1 billion. Ageing population automatically implies higher healthcare spending. Healthcare systems will need to prepare for increasing incidences of chronic conditions in progressively older populations, with a focus on providing preventive versus reactive care. Changing lifestyles have led to unhealthy eating habits, inadequate exercise, less sleep, and physical strains of the kind that were absent three to four decades ago. Consequentially, we see higher obesity rates, diabetes, poor digestion, cardiovascular problems, breathing diffi culties, spinal troubles, and other ailments. These diseases have not only created a demand for health supplements, but have also created greater dependence on regular medication.

These have occurred in developed countries as well as in emerging markets. Such pressures will continue, indeed exacerbate. Pharma majors will have to plan future sales with price moderation in mind.

## DR. REDDY'S MARKET PERFORMANCE, FY2018

North America Generics is Dr. Reddy's largest market. In FY2018, it contributed to over 52% of the GG sales and 42% of the company's overall sales.

## NORTH AMERICA GENERICS

Revenue from the region for FY2018 was ' 59.8 billion (US$ 919 million), representing a decline of 6% compared to the previous year. As mentioned before, the year continued to be challenging for the business on account of signifi cant price erosion faced due to channel consolidation and increased competition across some of the major products. The negative impact was partially offset by new product launches - the major ones being Liposomal Doxrubicin, EzetimibeSimvastatin, Palonosetron, Sevelamer Carbonate and Bivalirudin injection. Some key developments were:

- Launched Ezetimibe and Simvastatin tablets, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of VYTORINÂ® tablets, which is used to lower 'bad' cholesterol and fats (such as LDL and triglycerides) and raise 'good' cholesterol (HDL) in the blood;
- Launched Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome injection, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of DOXILÂ®, for intravenous use, in collaboration with the company's partner, Natco Pharma Ltd;
- Launched Sevelamer Carbonate tablets, a therapeutically equivalent generic version of RENVELAÂ® tablets, which is used to lower high blood phosphorus levels in patients who are on dialysis due to severe kidney disease;
- Filed 19 new ANDAs and one NDA during the year. These comprise some complex products and are across the different dosage forms.
- Gained signifi cant market share in certain products such as Metoprolol, Omeprazole, and Sirolimus; and

<!-- image -->

Our current priorities are new product launches by addressing specifi c USFDA queries, remediation at the plants impacted by the USFDA's warning letter, and de-risking of high-value launches from these plants. We will also focus on increasing market share on existing products without destroying the value of these drugs.

To ensure we continue to grow in the US market, our strategy is to focus on complex formulations, primarily injectables and oral solid dosage forms as well as OTC brands in the medium term, and 505(b)(2) generics, controlled substances under class II, and nonsubstitutable generics in the longer term.

## EMERGING MARKETS

Revenue from Emerging Markets for FY2018 was ' 22.7 billion, representing a growth of 8% compared to the previous year. This occurred on the back of new product launches as well as entry and scale-up in new markets.

Revenue from Russia for FY2018 was ' 12.6 billion, representing a 9% growth over the previous year on the back of new product launches and favorable currency rate. The growth was 4% in local currency (ruble) terms. During the year, we supplied the biosimilar Rituximab as part of the federal tender in Russia. We also launched OTC Nasivin, which is an

<!-- image -->

in-licensed product. The performance has been muted partially due to reduction in the channel inventory and due to season-related impact. We believe the growth rate should improve in FY2019. Nise, Omez, Ketorol, Cetrine, Ciprolet, Ibuclin, Nise gel, Novigan, Plagril, Razo, and Levolet continue to be brand leaders (each among the top three) in their respective categories, as reported by IMS Health in its moving report for the 12-month period ended 31 March 2018.

Revenue from CIS countries (including Romania) was ' 3.9 billion, representing 6% growth over the previous year. The growth was led by Ukraine and Kazakhstan through the increasing sale of existing products as well new launches. However, the growth was impacted due to temporary supplyrelated constraint in one of our key molecules in Romania.

During the year, we entered Brazil, Turkey and Algeria and scaled up our business in Columbia. Our focus is on institution business in most of these countries through biosimilars and oncology products. We have also grown well in the China market and expect it to be a relatively high growth market in the next few years.

Our strategy for growth in the emerging markets is to continue on the journey of expansion of biosimilars and oncology portfolio. We will focus on scaling up in our major markets, which include Russia, China, Brazil, South Africa and Ukraine.

## EUROPE

Revenue from Europe in FY2018 was ' 8.2 billion, representing a growth of 8% compared to the previous year, partially benefi ting from a favorable currency rate.

We have launched multiple new products in Germany and the UK during the year and also started making inroads into some new countries such as France, Italy, and Spain. Revenue growth was impacted due to a temporary supply disruption caused by non-renewal of GMP compliance status by the German regulatory authority during a part of the year. The matter has been satisfactorily resolved, and we expect the supplies to normalize in FY2019.

This market comprises 6% of the global generics sales. In the medium to long-term, we expect to grow in it by leveraging our in-house portfolio seeking in-licensing opportunities and scaling up business in the three new countries.

## INDIA

' 23.3 billion, representing a growth of 1% compared to previous year. India transitioned to the GST regime with effect from 1 July 2017, subsuming multiple indirect taxes, including excise duty and value-added tax. During the transition, there was a temporary disruption as the channel reduced inventory holdings. An increase in the GST rate for a portfolio of drugs also had to be absorbed by the company. In addition, there was a change in the method of reporting the indirect tax component.

## Revenue from India in FY2018 was

Adjusted growth for the GST transition related impacts, stood at 8%. India constitutes 20% of GG segment revenues.

As per the IMS in its moving report for the 12-month period ended 31 March 2018, our growth has been 1.8% versus a market growth of 6.3%. This has been on account of inadequate performance in the therapeutic areas of cardiovascular and anti-diabetes (CVAD). We have initiated remediation measures and expect to perform better in the FY2019.

The company has been doing well on the portfolio of products acquired from UCB in April 2015. We further expanded our collaboration with AMGENÂ® to market and distribute KYPROLISÂ® (Carfi lzomib) to treat relapsed multiple myeloma and REPATHAÂ® (Evolocumab) to treat hypercholesterolemia, in addition to the three already-marketed products, XGEVAÂ® (Denosumab), VECTIBIXÂ® (Panitumumab), and PROLIAÂ® (Denosumab).

In FY2019, our priorities are (a) driving productivity improvement, (b) focusing on our core therapeutic areas and big brands, and (c) scaling up our NCE launches done through the Amgen deal. In the medium to long-term, we

<!-- image -->

will focus on ramping up of biosimilars through internal and partnered assets and building differentiated products in relevant therapies, accompanied by a further ramping up of the base business.

## PSAI

The PSAI business recorded revenues of ' 22 billion in FY2018, which was a 3% growth over the previous year. During the year, 73 DMFs were fi led globally, of which 12 were in the US.

In November 2015, we received a warning letter from the USFDA after the inspection of our API manufacturing facilities at Miryalaguda (Telangana) and Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh).

These plants were re-inspected by the USFDA during February-April 2017. We received the Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) from the USFDA for the Miryalaguda facility, signalling the closure of all open observations. We have also received the EIR for the Srikakulam plant, although the USFDA has maintained an Offi cial Action Indicated (OAI) status for this site. We continue to engage with the USFDA to resolve the pending issues.

Our strategy of building a sustainable growing business involves new product launches and ramping up of base businesses in key geographies. We will also leverage our relationship with key customers by supplying material that has value addition over being a 'plain-vanilla' API.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

The PP business recorded revenue of ' 4.2 billion in FY2018, with a growth of 80%. The revenue included a milestone receipt of ' 1.5 billion as part of the out-licensing deal of Impoyzâ¢

(clobetasol propionate) cream 0.025%, which was approved by the USFDA during the year. The sale for our fi rst two products launched from the in-house pipeline ZEMBRACEÂ® and SERNIVOÂ® - gradually picked up during the year.

We have fi led an NDA for the migraine candidate DFN 02 (Sumatriptan intranasal spray). DFN-02 is a novel intranasal formulation for the treatment of acute migraine with or without aura. On the R&D front, our focus has been on advancing the development of the two in-licensed assets. These are:

- b) E7777, from Eisai, which is an anti-cancer agent.
- a) XP-23829 acquired from XenoPort, which is a clinical stage new oral entity that has the potential for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and may even be developed for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis; and

In addition, work is on in developing some internal pipeline products that involve dermatological and neurological assets, which are in mid-to-late stage development.

In the medium term, we believe that growth should come from the launch and scale-up of differentiated products based on bio-pathways and existing products. In the long-term, the growth would be from highly differentiated assets and the NCE pipeline.

## USFDA OBSERVATIONS: AN UPDATE

As mentioned earlier, the USFDA issued a warning letter dated 5 November 2015 relating to Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) deviations at our API manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as those at our

<!-- image -->

oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The contents of the warning letter emanated from Form 483 observations that followed inspections of these three sites in November 2014, January 2015, and February-March 2015, respectively. Pending resolution of the issues identifi ed in the warning letter, the USFDA has withheld the approval of new products from these facilities.

Subsequent to the warning letter, we promptly instituted corrective and preventive actions and submitted a comprehensive response to the USFDA, followed by periodic written updates and in-person meetings with the regulators. Moreover, to minimize the business impact, we transferred certain key products to alternative manufacturing facilities.

The USFDA subsequently re-inspected

these facilities between February and April 2017. The outcome of these inspections were as follows:

- API facility at Srikakulam: The USFDA raised two observations in the areas of High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) maintenance and the management of soft copies of chromatograms; and
- API facility at Miryalaguda: The USFDA raised three observations in the areas of older methods of validation, improvements in instrument calibrations, and adherence to United States Pharmacopeia (USP) test methods;
- Oncology formulation facility at Duvvada: The USFDA raised 13 observations in the areas of investigations, batch production records, document controls, general computer systems, and environmental monitoring.

we received an EIR for this; but the status of the site remains unchanged. We have invited the USFDA to schedule an inspection of the site.

We remain fully committed to follow high standards of quality and to strive towards further strengthening of our quality management systems and processes for sustainability. Our plans to enhance quality management systems and operations include improvements in the rigor of investigations and document control systems, standardization of instrument calibrations, strengthening controls with respect to information technology, strengthening shop fl oor training programs, and simplifying and standardizing operating procedures and batch records at the shop fl oor.

Further, we have initiated additional operational improvements with respect to areas such as shop fl oor supervision and Gemba walks (or process walks) in the shop fl oor, engineering, implementation of electronic batch records to eliminate manual errors, and an additional focus on the robustness of processes. Throughout the process of remediating issues raised in the warning letter, we have been continually engaged with the USFDA in conveying the progress we have made.

We are fully committed to producing safe and effi cacious products for our patients.

## REVENUE

The total revenue grew by 1% to ' 142,028 million in FY2018. As previously mentioned, growth was impacted due to the signifi cant price erosion in the US market, lower contribution from India due to GST transition, and temporary supply constraints in Europe on account of the German regulatory audit.

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profi t declined by 2.6% to ' 76,304 million in FY2018. This led to a gross profi t margin of 53.7% in FY2018 - representing a decline of 1.9% points compared to FY2017. The gross profi t margin for GG was 58.9%. For the PSAI business, it was 20.2%. The GG gross profi t margin was impacted due to higher price erosion on account of channel consolidation and new competition in the US. PSAI's gross profi t margin was affected due to an unfavorable product mix.

## SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES

SG&A expenses increased marginally by 1% to ' 46,910 million in FY2018. Freight outward costs increased due to higher mix of air shipments. The increases were largely offset by a signifi cant focus on cost optimization, especially by lower spends on legal and professional consultancy. SG&A accounted for 33% of sales in FY2018.

## R&D EXPENSES

R&D expenses for FY2018 were ' 18,265 million, or 12.9% of revenue versus 13.9% in FY2017. The absolute and proportional decrease in R&D spends is in line with our continued focus on cost optimization, productivity improvement, and prioritization of

projects, which have been executed in a manner that does not impinge on our focus on building the pipeline of complex generics, biosimilars, and differentiated products.

## NET FINANCE INCOME

The net fi nance income was ' 2,080 million in FY2018 versus ' 806 million in FY2017.

## INCOME TAX

For FY2018, income tax expense was ' 4,535 million, with an effective tax rate of 31.6%. This tax outgo was 73% higher than FY2017 ( ' 2,614 million and an effective tax rate of 17.8%). The FY2018 rate was higher due to a one-time charge taken during transition to a new tax regime in the US (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017). Adjusted for it, the effective tax rate is 22.5%. The lower tax rate in FY2017 was primarily on account of satisfactory resolution of certain tax matters pertaining to prior years.

## NET PROFIT

The net profi t decreased by 19% to ' 9,806 million in FY2018. This represents a PAT margin of 6.9% of revenues versus 8.5% in FY2017.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The data is given in Tables 4 and 5 . Cash generated from operating activities in FY2018 was ' 18,029 million. Investing activities amounting to ' 14,883 million in FY2018 include net investment in property, plant, equipment, and intangibles to build capacity and capabilities for future business growth. Cash outfl ow fr omfi nancing activities was ' 4,440 million. Closing cash and cash equivalents as on 31 March 2018 was ' 2,542 million.

## DEBT-EQUITY

In FY2018, long-term borrowings, including the current and non-current portion, increased by ' 19,593 million. This was primarily to refi nance shortterm borrowings, which decreased by ' 18,064 million. As on 31 March 2018, the company's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.40, similar to last year. The net debt-to-equity position was at 0.24 versus 0.25 last year. Table 6 gives the data.

## ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

- Proactively identify and highlight risks to the right stakeholder;

Dr. Reddy's ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- Facilitate discussions around risk prioritization and mitigation;
- Develop systems to warn when the appetite is being breached; and
- Provide a framework to assess risk capacity and appetite;
- Provide an analysis of residual risk.

The ERM team connects with the company's business units and functions, which are the primary sources for risk identifi cation. It also monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers in the industry.

ERM at Dr. Reddy's focuses on identifi cation of key business, and operational and strategic risks. These are

carried out through structured interviews, on-call discussions, or review of incidents. The team collaborates with the company's compliance, Sarbanes-Oxley, and internal audit teams on operational, compliance, fi nancial reporting, and process aspects to identify and mitigate risks of business units.

R isks are aggregated at the unit, function, and the organization levels and are categorized by risk groups. The company's response framework categorizes these risks into (i) preventable, (ii) strategic, and (iii) external risks. The fi nance, investment, and risk management (FIRM) council is Dr. Reddy's management committee that helps the ERM function to prioritize organization-wide risks and steer mitigation efforts in line with the company's risk capacity and appetite. The FIRM council also oversees fi nancial risk management decisions.

Mitigation work carried out by the ERM team is periodically reviewed, and the progress on key risks is discussed with the FIRM council, the company's senior management, as well as at the risk management committee of the board of directors. These include (i) updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks and (ii) specifi c risk-related initiatives carried out during the year.

During FY2018, the ERM team focused on mitigation of certain country risks, assessing and reinforcing cyber securityrelated posture, and also conducted reviews of other operating risks.

## HUMAN RESOURCES (HR)

In line with our employee value proposition of providing meaningful opportunities for learning and growth, this year the focus has been on strengthening our internal talent management approach. The need to develop and groom leaders from within the organization is emphasised by the talent shortage in the industry that we operate in. With this objective in mind, we have taken a few initiatives such as institutionalizing processes for succession planning and engaging key talent.

Our new stint-based program for campus hires from premium technical and management institutes launched this year, is an endeavour in this direction. This program is a 15 month intensive learning journey with a structured set of operational and cross functional stints. It is designed to groom young talent for taking up challenging roles ahead. We also ran a development centre for our existing campus hires and empowered them to work on their strengths and areas of development through career conversations and leadership guidance.

We continue our fl agship leadership development program called New Horizon Leadership Program (NHLP) for our senior leaders. This program delivered outstanding outcomes both in personal development and breakthrough business projects. We have extended the learnings from this program for the next level leaders to create our managerial development program (NHMP) which has also

<!-- image -->

delivered similar outcomes. Focused efforts are also being made to upgrade leadership capability across plants.

Over the last year, our focus has also been on creating a culture of discipline and compliance in the manufacturing shop fl oor. We have introduced several interventions towards this, such as revamping our learning, rewards and recognition framework aligned to desired behaviours and business outcomes , enhancing employee connect through town halls and communication.

We continue with our efforts of building a diverse and inclusive workplace. This has been recognized with Dr. Reddy's featuring in fi rst Sector-Neutral Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index. We are the only pharmaceutical company globally, and the only Indian company to make it to the list. The index measures gender equality across internal company statistics, employee policies, external community support and engagement, and gender-conscious product offerings. This is a validation of our people policies that go the extra mile to support our women colleagues. Within India also we strengthened our position as an employer of choice for women and have been ranked by Avatar as one of the best places to work for women.

We conducted an organization wide engagement survey for employees across geographies, levels and are happy to share that our engagement scores are amongst the top quartile globally. The survey measured the overall satisfaction, pride of association, recommendation and intent to stay. The results refl ect the pride that employees feel in working with us and the confi dence they place in our organization's future.

## OUTLOOK

FY2018 has been challenging on account of a significant price erosion in the US market, the GST transition impact in India, and the temporary supply disruption in Europe. While price competitiveness will remain the leitmotif in the US, we believe that the rate of price erosion peaked in FY2018 and ought to taper down. The other two disruptions were of temporary nature and should not have an impact on FY2019 performance.

At present, there remains the question of a final, favorable resolution of the USFDA's position vis-Ã -vis our API plant in Srikakulam and our oncological formulations facility in Duvvada. Although we have successfully transferred some of our key products from these plants to others, the fact remains that pending a successful conclusion, we are producing less than we should from these facilities and are constrained to introduce some high-value specialty products in the US. We are planning to request a USFDA reinspection in 2018, which, hopefully, will result in a favorable outcome. However, that remains an open issue as of date.

Even so, we believe that Dr. Reddy's will be able to improve its performance in FY2019. We are preparing for a set of new product launches in the US; we are expanding our footprint in emerging markets through volume growth and new launches; we expect to do better in Europe now that the setback on account of the German regulatory inspection is behind us; and we are striving to perform better than the overall market in India.

Despite the multiple headwinds being faced by the industry, we are cautiously optimistic of improving our performance in FY2019.

FY2018 represents fi scal year 2017-18 from 1 April 2017 to 31 March 2018, and analogously for FY2017 and previously such labeled years.

The board provides leadership, strategic guidance, objective and independent views to the company's management while discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, thereby ensuring that the management adheres to high standards of ethics, transparency and disclosure.

The board regularly reviews the company's governance, risk and compliance framework, business plans, and organization structure to align with the highest global standards.

Each director informs the company on an annual basis about the board and board committee positions she/he occupies in other companies, and notifi es it of any changes regarding their directorships. In addition, the independent directors provide an annual confi rmation that they meet the criteria of independence as defi ned under Indian laws.

Table 1 gives the composition of Dr. Reddy's board, with all relevant details.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

The board, on recommendations of the nomination, governance and compensation committee, considers the appointment and reappointment of directors.

Section 149(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, provides that an independent director shall hold offi ce up to fi ve consecutive years on the board of a company and shall be eligible for reappointment on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders. Moreover, independent directors cannot retire by rotation. Accordingly, all independent directors of Dr. Reddy's were appointed as such for terms ranging from one to fi ve years at the 30th annual general meeting of the company. The term of Mr. Anupam Puri, an independent director, ends at the forthcoming 34th annual general meeting. Considering the outcome of his performance evaluation, the board has recommended the reappointment of Mr. Puri as an independent director under section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013 for another term of one year, for approval of the shareholders at the forthcoming 34th AGM scheduled on 27 July 2018.

Section 152 of the Companies Act, 2013, states that one-third of the board members other than independent

directors who are subject to retire by rotation, shall do so every year and be eligible for reappointment, if approved by the shareholders. Mr. K Satish Reddy, retires by rotation at the forthcoming annual general meeting and, being eligible, seeks re-appointment. Additionally, Mr. Prasad R Menon was appointed as an additional director of the company, categorized as Independent with effect from 30 October 2017. Thus, in the forthcoming annual general meeting, approval of shareholders is being sought for:

- ii. Reappointment of Mr. Anupam Puri as an independent director under section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013 for a term of one year.
- i. Reappointment of Mr. K Satish Reddy, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for the reappointment.
- iii. Appointment of Mr. Prasad R Menon as an independent director under section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013 for a term of fi ve years with effect from 30 October 2017.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the board is the responsibility of the nomination, governance and compensation committee of the board, which consists entirely of independent directors. Given the existing composition of the board, the tenure as well as the years left of the existing members to serve on the board, and the need for new domain expertise are reviewed by this committee. When such a need becomes apparent, the committee reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings in India. It then places the details of shortlisted candidates to the board for its consideration. If the board approves, the person is appointed as an additional director, subject to the approval of shareholders in the company's next general meeting.

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new independent director with the company, an information kit containing documents about the company - such as its annual reports, sustainability reports, investor

presentations, recent press releases, research reports, code of business conduct and ethics (COBE) and the memorandum and articles of association - is provided. The new independent director individually meets with board members and senior management. Visits to plants are organized for the director to understand the company's operations.

Dr. Reddy's believes that the board should be continuously empowered with knowledge of latest developments affecting the company and the industry. Apart from regular presentations on company's business strategies and associated risks, expositions are made on various topics covering the pharmaceutical industry. Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial pronouncements around industryrelated laws are regularly circulated to the directors. They also visit the company's manufacturing and research locations. Each director has complete and unfettered access to any of the company's information and full freedom to interact with senior management.

Details of the familiarization programs for independent directors are available on the company's website www.drreddys.com/media/643664/ familiarization-programs-2018.pdf

## LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Upon their appointment, independent directors are given a formal appointment letter containing, inter alia, the term of appointment, roles, function, duties and responsibilities, the company's code of conduct, disclosures and confi dentiality. For such terms and conditions, see: www.drreddys.com/investor/ governance/policies-and-documents/ terms-condition-directors.html

## BOARD EVALUATION

The board carries out an annual evaluation of its performance, the working of its committees and members. On two such occasions, an independent expert was engaged to conduct the evaluation process. For the annual internal evaluation, each director completes a questionnaire that involves peer evaluation and feedback on processes of the board and its committees. The contribution and impact of individual members is evaluated on a number of parameters,

such as level of engagement, independence of judgment, confl icts resolution and contributions to enhance the board's overall effectiveness. Peer ratings on certain parameters, positive attributes and improvement areas for each director are provided to them on a confi dential basis.

The committees are evaluated on certain parameters such as effective discharge of their roles, responsibilities and advice given to the board for discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, including adequate and periodical updates to the board on the committees' functioning.

## V. REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS, KMPs, SENIOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL AND OTHER EMPLOYEES

The committee shall recommend to the board for their approval, any remuneration to be paid to the executive directors. The committee will separately review and approve the remuneration to be paid to KMPs and senior management personnel.

The level and composition of remuneration so determined by the Committee shall be reasonable and suffi cient required to attract, retain and motivate directors, KMPs and senior management in order to run the company successfully. There shall be a clear linkage of remuneration to performance and health targets. The remuneration shall be a mix of fi xed and variable pay/long-term pay refl ecting short and long-term performance objectives appropriate to the working of the company and its strategic goals.

The key principles for each of the positions are outlined below:

- 2) Non-executive directors - The non-executive directors shall receive remuneration by way of sitting fees and reimbursement of expenses for attending meetings of board or committee thereof. In addition, the non-executive and independent directors shall also be eligible to receive profi t related commission, as may be approved by the shareholders of the company. They shall not be entitled to any stock options;
- 1) Executive directors - The executive directors shall be paid remuneration by way of monthly compensation and profi t based commission. The total remuneration to be paid to the executive directors shall be within the limits prescribed under the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules made thereunder;

The chairman of the company shall propose remuneration to be paid to non-executive directors.

- The proposal for the remuneration shall be benchmarked with global pharmaceutical companies and the contribution made and time dedicated by each director;
- 4) Other employees - The compensation program for employees is designed to help drive performance culture and align employees for the creation of sustainable value through behaviors like execution excellence, innovation and leadership. In line with the organization principles of managing the long-term and meritocracy, there are four principles of pay which have been enumerated - ability to pay, position-linked pay, person-specifi c pay and performance-linked pay. The company may periodically review the compensation and benefi ts at all levels to ensure that the company remains competitive and is able to attract and retain desirable talent. The committee may review the overall compensation approach for employees and on any changes done for the entire organization.
- 3) KMPs and senior management personnel - Dr. Reddy's recognizes that those chosen to lead the organization are vital to its ongoing success and growth. Thus, these executives should be offered competitive and reasonable compensation so that Dr. Reddy's can attract, retain and encourage critical talent to meet important organizational goals and strategies. The compensation will be the mix of fi xed pay, variable pay, performance based incentive plans or stock options. The executive total compensation program will be fl exible to differentiate pay to recognize an individual incumbents' critical skills, contributions, and future potential to impact the organization's success; and

## VI. BOARD DIVERSITY

Building a diverse and inclusive workplace is an integral part of Dr. Reddy's culture. These principles are also applied to the composition of our board.

The board of directors shall have the optimum combination of directors from different areas/fi elds of expertise and experience like operations, management, quality assurance, fi nance, sales and marketing, supply chain, research and

development, human resources etc., or as may be considered appropriate. The board shall have at least one member who has accounting or related fi nancial management expertise and at least three members who are fi nancially literate.

At least one member of the board should be a woman.

## VII. CONFIDENTIALITY

The members of the committee may not disclose, in particular, the information contained in the confi dential reports they receive or the contents of confi dential discussions. They shall also ensure that any employees appointed to support them likewise comply with this rule.

## VIII. REVIEW

This policy will be reviewed at appropriate time, as decided by the committee. The utility and interpretation of this policy will be at the sole discretion of the committee.

## REPORT OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE

The audit committee of the board of directors consists of three directors. Each member is an independent director as defi ned under Indian laws, Listing Regulations and the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Guidelines. The committee operates under a written charter adopted by the board of directors, and has been vested with all the powers necessary to effectively discharge its responsibilities.

Dr. Reddy's management has primary responsibility for the fi nancial statements and reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. During FY2018, the audit committee met six times. It discussed with the company's internal auditors, statutory auditors and independent auditors the scope and plans for their respective audits. It also discussed the results of their examination, their evaluation of the company's internal controls, and overall quality of the company's fi nancial reporting. The audit committee provides

at each of its meetings an opportunity for internal and external auditors to meet privately with the members of the committee, without the presence of management.

During the year, the committee also reviewed the following:

- b) Structure of the internal audit function and chief internal auditor's remuneration; and
- a) Non-audit services being provided by the statutory and independent auditors and concluded that such services were not in confl ict with their independence;
- c) Related party transactions, as applicable.

The committee ensures that the company's code of business conduct and ethics has a mechanism such that no personnel intending to make a complaint relating to securities and fi

nancial reporting shall be denied access to the audit committee.

The audit committee has recommended to the board of directors:

- 2. That the fi nancial statements prepared as per IFRS as issued by International Accounting Standards Board for the year ended 31 March 2018 be accepted by the board and be included in the company's annual report on Form 20-F, to be fi led with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
- 1. That the audited standalone and consolidated fi nancial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited for the year ended 31 March 2018 prepared as per Ind AS be accepted by the board as a true and fair statement of the fi nancial status of the company; and

In addition, the committee has also recommended the following to the board:

- Continuation of M/s. S R Batliboi & Associates LLP, chartered accountants as statutory auditors under Ind AS, in line with the approval of the shareholders in the 32nd AGM; and

To expedite the process of share transfers, the company secretary has been delegated with the power to attend to the share transfer formalities at regular intervals.

Pursuant to the provisions of section 46 of the Companies Act, 2013 read with rule 6(2)(a) of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, duplicate share certificates, in lieu of those that are lost or destroyed, should only be issued with the prior consent of the board. However, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs vide its general circular no. 19/2014, dated 12 June 2014, has clarified that the powers of the board with regard to the issue of duplicate share certificates can be exercised by a committee of directors. Therefore, the board of directors, at its meeting held on 12 May 2015, delegated the power to issue duplicate share certificates, to the stakeholders' relationship committee.

The stakeholders' relationship committee attends to such requests at regular intervals.

The company periodically reviews the operations of its RTA. The number of shares transferred/transmitted in physical form during the last two financial years are given in Table 6 .

The company dispatches the postal ballot notices and forms along with self-addressed business reply envelope to its shareholders whose names appear on the register of members/list of beneficiaries as on a cut-off date. The postal ballot notice is sent to the shareholders in electronic form to the e-mail IDs registered with the DPs/RTA.

Voting rights are reckoned on the paid-up value of the shares registered in the names of the shareholders as on the cutoff date. Shareholders desiring to exercise their votes by physical postal ballot forms are requested to return the forms duly completed and signed, to the scrutinizer on or before the closing of the voting period. Shareholders desiring to exercise their votes by electronic mode are requested to vote before close of business hours on the last day of e-voting.

Revenues from Global Generics declined by 1% and stood at ' 114 billion. There was growth across Emerging Markets and India, partially offset by decline in North America Generics.

Revenues from North America declined by 6%, to ' 59.8 billion. This was largely on account of higher price erosions due to channel consolidation and increased competition in some of our key molecules, such as valganciclovir, azacytidine and decitabine.

## ANNEXURE 2 TO THE INDEPENDENTAUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

We have audited the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company") as of 31 March b 2018 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone fi nancial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The Company's Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal fi nancial controls based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal fi nancial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable fi nancial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing as specifi ed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal fi nancial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fi nancial reporting and the preparation of fi nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly refl ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## 1.2 Basis of preparation of fi nancial statements

The fi nancial statements of the Company have been prepared and presented in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") notifi ed under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and as amended from time to time.

These fi nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

- ï·ï  derivative fi nancial instruments are measured at fair value;
- ï·ï  certain fi nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the classifi cation;
- ï·ï  employee defi ned benefi t assets/(liability) are remeasured at the net total of the fair value of plan assets, plus actuarial losses, less actuarial gains and the present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation;

- ï·ï  Share-based payments.

## 1.3 Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information about signifi cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signifi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes:

- Â· Note 1.4 (a) - Assessment of functional currency;
- Â· Note 1.4 (q) - Financial instruments;
- Â· Note 1.4 (b) - Business combinations;
- Â· Notes 1.4 (j) and 1.4 (k) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- Â· Note 1.4 (m) - Valuation of inventories;

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.4 Signifi cant accounting policies

## a) Functional currency

These fi nancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is also the functional currency of the Company. All fi nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

## b) Business combinations and goodwill

In accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 101, First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, the Company has elected to apply the accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the fair value of the net identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the OCI and accumulates the same in equity as capital reserve where there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase else the gain is directly recognised in equity as capital reserve. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships and employee service related payments.

Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the defi nition of a fi nancial instrument is classifi ed as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifi able net assets. Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination, such as fi nder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

However, the following assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at the basis indicated below:

- ï·ï  Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the assets or liabilities related to employee benefi t arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12, Income Taxes and Ind AS 19, Employee Benefi ts respectively.
- ï·ï  Liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share - based payments arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with Ind AS 102, Share-based Payment at the acquisition date.
- ï·ï  Assets (or disposal groups) that are classifi ed as held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
- ï·ï  Reacquired rights are measured at a value determined on the basis of the remaining contractual term of the related contract. Such valuation does not consider potential renewal of the reacquired right.

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the difference arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## c) Current and non-current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.

## Assets:

An asset is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets/liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets/liabilities respectively. All other assets/liabilities are classifi ed as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always disclosed as non-current.

## d) Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous fi nancial statements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise with the exception of the following:

- Â· Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in OCI; and
- Â· Qualifying cash fl ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are effective

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash fl ows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## e) Revenue

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts, allowances, goods and services tax (GST) and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

Revenue from sales of generic products in India is recognised upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company. Signifi cant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of generic products are transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. Clearing and forwarding agents are generally compensated on a commission basis as a percentage of sales made by them. Revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in India is recognised on delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories of the Company, at which point all the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Revenue from export sales and other sales outside of India is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred to the customers, which occurs upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for specifi c revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised once all such activities are completed.

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profi t share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profi t share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profi ts, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profi t share component is recognised as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profi t share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profi t share is available. Otherwise, recognition is deferred to a subsequent period pending satisfaction of such collectability and measurability requirements. In measuring the amount of profi t share revenue to be recognised for each period, the Company uses all available information and evidence, including any confi rmations from the business partner of the profi t share amount owed to the Company, to the extent made available before the date the Company's Board of Directors authorises the issuance of its fi nancial statements for the applicable period.

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive, or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## f) Interest income and dividend

Interest income primarily comprises of interest from term deposits with banks and on loans to subsidiary companies. Interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the fi nancial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the fi nancial asset. Interest income is included in other income in the statement of profi t and loss.

Dividend income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

## g) Government grants

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signifi cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## h) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for fi nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences:

- ï·ï  the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profi t;
- ï·ï  differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- ï·ï  taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefi t will be realised.

The Company recognises deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfi ed:

- a) When the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and
- b) it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## i) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## j) Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. General and specifi c borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefi ts embodied within the part will fl ow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life, whichever is shorter.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change(s) are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors .

## The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|                                            | Years    |
|--------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                  |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                     | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and machinery                        | 5 to 10  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                   | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date is disclosed as capital advances under other non-current assets. The cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated.

In respect of equity  accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of  the investment, and any impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset,  including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying value of the equity accounted investee.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of other consideration  given to acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition or construction, or, when applicable,  the amount attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the specifi c  requirements of other Indian Accounting Standards.                                |

Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets or on any other basis that refl ects the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefi ts are expected to be consumed by the entity. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|                                                                  | Years   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Customer contracts                                               | 2 to 5  |
| Technical know-how                                               | 10      |
| Product related intangibles                                      | 5 to15  |
| Copyrights and Patents (including marketing/distribution rights) | 3 to 15 |
| Other intangibles                                                | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a fi nite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

Intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefi nite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefi ts are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the statement of profi t and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as on the date of de-recognition.

## l) Leases

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classifi ed as either a fi nance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the lessee is classifi ed as a fi nance lease. All other leases are classifi ed as operating leases.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under fi nance leases are apportioned between the fi nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The fi nance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general infl ation to compensate for the lessor's expected infl ationary cost increases.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

## m) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and fi nished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of fi nished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares, that do not qualify to be recognised as property, plant and equipment, consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the allowance for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## n) Impairment of non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-fi nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefi nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defi ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash infl ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash infl ows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefi t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cashgenerating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated fi rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

## o) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefi ts are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defi ned contribution plans are charged to the statement of profi t and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefi t plans and other post-employment benefi ts is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outfl ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefi ts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefi t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defi ned benefi t plan, recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in employee benefi t expense, refl ects the increase in the defi ned benefi t obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefi t changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefi t obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefi t expense in the statement of profi t and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefi ts are recognised as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefi ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefi ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefi ts is the amount of future benefi t that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefi t is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary Re-measurements are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Share-based payments

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, in the statement of profi t and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## p) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outfl ow of economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash fl ows at a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outfl ow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

## Contingent assets

Contingent assets are not recognised in the fi nancial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an infl ow of economic benefi ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## q) Financial instruments

A fi nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a fi nancial asset of one entity and a fi nancial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

All fi nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of fi nancial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the fi nancial asset. Purchases or sales of fi nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

- ï·ï  Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- ï·ï  Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI);
- ï·ï  Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profi t or loss (FVTPL); and
- ï·ï  Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and
- b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specifi ed dates to cash fl ows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such fi nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in other income in the statement of profi t and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A 'debt instrument' is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) The asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profi t and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassifi ed to the statement of profi t and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). The Company has not designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS103 applies are classifi ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The classifi cation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the statement of profi t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture:

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable amount. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the difference between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Upon fi rst-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., b 1 b April b 2015.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fi nancial asset or part of a group of similar fi nancial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

- ï·ï  The rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired; or
- ï·ï  The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash fl ows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement Í¾ and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that refl ects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18.

For this purpose, the Company follows 'simplifi ed approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of simplifi ed approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classifi ed, at initial recognition, as fi nancial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All fi nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's fi nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts, fi nancial guarantee contracts and derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of fi nancial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss include fi nancial liabilities held for trading and fi nancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative fi nancial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defi ned by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profi t or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfi ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profi t and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. The Company has not designated any fi nancial liability as fair value through profi t and loss.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Loans and borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as fi nance costs in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modifi cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, South African rands ("ZAR"), Romanian new leus ("RON") and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivative fi nancial instruments) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative fi nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifi es its derivative fi nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classifi ed to the statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash fl ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain/loss on such non-derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassifi ed to the statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## r) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of our cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash fl ows.

## s) Trade receivables

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## t) Trade and other payables

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the fi nancial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within twelve months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

## 1.5 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain fi nancial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specifi c to that asset or liability. A fair value measurement of a non-fi nancial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefi ts by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method after deduction of a fair return on other assets that are part of creating the related cash fl ows.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profi t margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash fl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For fi nance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have fl oating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share da ta and wher e otherwise stated)

## EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of DRL (the "Committee") administer the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at Annual General Meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The weighted average grant date fair value of par value options granted under category B of the DRL 2007 Plan during the years ended 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017 was ' 2,540 and ' 3,266, respectively. The weighted average share price on the date of exercise of options during the years ended 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017 was ' 2,295 and ' 3,268, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the DRL 2007 Plan during the years ended 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017 was ' 57 and ' 110, respectively. As of 31 b March b 2018, options outstanding under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 223 and options exercisable under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 23.

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company adopted a new program to grant performance linked stock options to certain employees under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan. Under this program, performance targets are measured each year against pre-defi ned interim targets over the three year period ending on 31 b March b 2017 and eligible employees are granted stock options upon meeting such targets. The stock options so granted are ultimately vested with the employees who meet subsequent service vesting conditions which range from one to four years.After vesting, such stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted under category B, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term, contractual term, as well as expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted under category A, the option life is estimated based on the simplifi ed method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions refl ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

## 2.25 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

## Gratuity benefi ts provided by the Company

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a defi ned benefi t plan which provides for gratuity payments (the "Gratuity Plan") and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund") to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by Government of India, corporate debt securities and in equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the statement of profi t and loss for the years ended 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017 consist of the following:

## e) Deferred tax assets and liabilities

The tax effects of signifi cant temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of the items that created these differences is given below:

| Deferred tax assets/(liabilities)  |                             |                              |

| Investments                        | (16)                        | (490)                        |

In assessing whether the deferred tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefi ts of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

The changes in fair value of such interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of fi nance cost.

As at 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of fi nancial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to refl ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

## a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sens itivefi nancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in US$, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias, UK pounds sterling, and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in US$ and Russian roubles). A signifi cant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a signifi cant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fl uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative fi nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency fi nancial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.30 above.

In respect of the Company's forward contracts and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- Â· a ' 1,277/(1,338) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 843/(749) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profi t from such contracts, as at 31 b March b 2018;
- Â· a ' 1,154/(710) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 1,707/(1,854) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profi t from such contracts, as at 31 b March b 2017.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

For the years ended 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned fi nancial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 939 and ' 1,866, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017, the Company had ' 22,811 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR minus 30 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps and ' 18,061 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR minus 30 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps, respectively. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profi les, refer to note 2.7A and 2.7B of these fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017, every 10% increase or decrease in the fl oating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 42 and ' 23, respectively.

The carrying value of the Company's foreign currency borrowings designated in a cash fl ow hedge as of 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017 was ' Nil.

The Company's investments in bonds, commercial paper and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate signifi cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fl uctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 b March b 2018, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

## b) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of fi nancial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a fi nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is infl uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an infl uence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signifi cant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

## Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certifi cates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 b March b 2018. Of the total trade receivables, ' 35,390 as at 31 b March b 2018 and ' 31,071 as at 31 b March b 2017 consisted of customer balances that were neither past due nor impaired.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

Financial assets that are past due

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The ageing of trade receivables that are past due is given below:

| PERIOD (IN DAYS)                 | AS AT 31 b  MARCH b  2018   | AS AT 31 b  MARCH b  2017   |

The Company uses Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for assessing the impairment loss. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers.

## Reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses

The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017 are as follows:

## c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its fi nancial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 b March b 2018 and 31 b March b 2017, the Company had unutilised credit limits from banks of ' 14,209 and ' 12,437 respectively.

As at 31 b March b 2018, the Company had working capital of ' 43,186, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 1,207, investments in bonds of ' 3,279, investment in commercial paper of ' 232 and investments in FVTPL fi nancial assets of ' 13,317.As at 31 b March b 2017, the Company had working capital of ' 43,358, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 668, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certifi cates of deposits having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 2,110 and investments in FVTPL fi nancial assets of ' 10,881.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts) The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more signifi cant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected fi nancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case. The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its fi nancial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Norfl oxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfl oxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfl oxacin. Under the Drugs Prices Control Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specifi ed product" and fi x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notifi cation and designated Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" and fi xed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company fi led a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fi xing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company fi led a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fi xed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest. The Company fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company fi led an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA fi led a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfl oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of exper ts in the fi eld. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fi xing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfl oxacin was fi led by the Company with the Delhi High Court. Upon the request of the respondents to fi le a counter, the Delhi High Court has adjourned the matter to 26 b November 2018.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifi cations regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, fi led a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifi cations issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 b September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition fi led by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notifi ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA fi led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016.This recall application fi led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition, with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 b March b 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had fi led, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company fi led a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to fi le a fi nal counter affi davit within six weeks subsequent to which the Company could fi le a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter affi davit was fi led by the Union of India. The Company subsequently fi led a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 8 August 2018 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 416 under "selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") fi led a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for "udenafi l'' (a patented compound) and an udenafi l fi nished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and fi nished dosage forms of udenafi l and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the fi ling of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. In this regard, the C ompany fi led a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. Company's interlocutory appeal of the said denial, was also denied.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously d efend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this complaint is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

## (iii) Shareholder Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was fi led against the Company, its Chief Executive Offi cer, and its Chief Financial Offi cer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Offi cer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public fi lings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were affected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants fi led a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of this complaint is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (iv) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action fi led a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land.

Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently fi led a review petition against the Judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017, in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not material to the fi nancial statements.Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2018.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-fi nding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notifi cation in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notifi cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (v) Indirect taxes related matters

## Distribution of input service tax credits

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various demand notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED                               | STATUS                                                     |

| April 2014 to March 2015          | '  108 plus interest and penalties            | The Company has fi led an appeal before the CESTAT.        |
| April 2015 to March 2016          | '  157 plus interest and penalties            | The Company is in the process of responding to the notice. |

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 b March b 2018.

## Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company has received various demand notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED        | STATUS                                                                                 |

| April 2011 to March 2013          | '  16 plus 10% penalty | The Appellate Deputy Commissioner issued an order partially in favour of  the Company. |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 27 as of 31 March 2018, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 278. The Company has responded to such demand notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these fi nancial statements as of 31 b March b 2018.

## (vi) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions fi led by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition fi led by the Company in this regard for the period from 1April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## RECEIPT OF WARNING LETTER FROM THE U.S. FDA

The Company received a warning letter dated 5 November 2015 from the U.S. FDA relating to current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") deviations at its active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as violations at its oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The contents of the warning letter emanated from Form 483 observations that followed inspections of these sites by the U.S. FDA in November 2014, January 2015 and February-March 2015, respectively.

The warning letter does not restrict production or shipment of the Company's products from these facilities. However, unless and until the Company is able to correct outstanding issues to the U.S. FDA's satisfaction, the U.S. FDA may withhold approval of new products and new drug applications of the Company, refuse admission of products manufactured at the facilities noted in the warning letter into the United States, and/or take additional regulatory or legal action against the Company. Any such further action could have a material and negative impact on the Company's ongoing business and operations. During the years ended 31 b March b 2017 and 2018, the U.S. FDA withheld approval of new products from these facilities pending resolution of the issues identifi ed in the warning letter. To minimise the business impact, the Company transferred certain key products to alternate manufacturing facilities.

Subsequent to the issuance of the warning letter, the Company promptly instituted corrective actions and preventive actions and submitted a comprehensive response to the warning letter to the U.S. FDA, followed by periodic written updates and in-person meetings with the U.S. FDA. The U.S. FDA completed the re-inspection of the aforementioned manufacturing facilities in the months of February, March and April 2017. During the re-inspections, the U.S. FDA issued three observations with respect to the API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda, two observations with respect to the API manufacturing facility at Srikakulam and thirteen observations with respect to the Company's oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada. The Company has responded to these observations identifi ed by the U.S. FDA and believes that it can resolve them in a timely manner.

In June 2017, the U.S. FDA issued an Establishment Inspection Report ("EIR") which indicated that the inspection of the Company's API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda is successfully closed.

With regard to the Company's oncology manufacturing facility at Duvvada and its API manufacturing facility at Srikakulam, the Company received EIRs from the U.S. FDA in November 2017 and February 2018, respectively, which indicated that the inspection status of these facilities remains unchanged.

## Inspection of other facilities:

In May and June 2017, inspection of the Company's Formulations Srikakulam Plan (SEZ) Unit II and I, India, was completed by the U.S. FDA with zero and one observations, respectively, and the U.S. FDA issued EIRs in September 2017 for both Units II and I, indicating the closure of the audit for these facilities.

The inspection of the Company's Custom Pharmaceutical Services facility in Hyderabad, India was completed by the U.S. FDA on 21 September 2017 with zero observations, and the U.S. FDA issued an EIR in December 2017 indicating the closure of audit for this facility.

In April 2017, inspection of the Company's formulations manufacturing facility at Bachupally, Hyderabad was completed by the U.S. FDA and the Company was issued a Form 483 with 11 observations. In December 2017, the U.S. FDA issued an EIR which indicates the closure of the audit for this facility.

In March 2018,The inspection of two of the Company's Custom Pharmaceutical Services facility in API manufacturing facilities namely, the API Hyderabad Plant 1, and the API Hyderabad Plant 3, India was completed by the U.S. FDA with four and fi ve observations, respectively. The observations at API Hyderabad Plant 3 were related to procedures and facility maintenance. The Company has responded to these observations and believes that it can address all these observations comprehensively in a timely manner.

## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted by the Company:

Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In March 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") has notifi ed Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2018. This comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance, and requires an entity to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that refl ects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and contract modifi cations) and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements.

Ind AS 115 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2018.

The Company intends to adopt Ind AS 115 effective 1 April 2018, using the modifi ed retrospective method. The adoption of Ind AS 115 is not expected to have a signifi cant impact on the Company's recognition of revenues from product sales, service income and license fee.

## Other Amendments:

On 28 March 2018, the MCA, issued certain amendments to Ind AS. The amendments relate to the following standards:

- ï·ï  Ind AS 40, Investment Property
- ï·ï  Ind AS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
- ï·ï  Ind AS 12, Income Taxes
- ï·ï  Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
- ï·ï  Ind AS 112, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities

The amendments are effective 1 April 2018. The Company believes that the aforementioned amendments will not materially impact the fi nancial position, performance or the cash fl ows of the Company.

## ANNEXURE 1 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED

Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited as of and for the year ended 31 March 2018, we have audited the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company"), its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal fi nancial controls based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal fi nancial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and effi cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable fi nancial information, as required under the Act.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing as specifi ed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal fi nancial controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditors' judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of fi nancial reporting and the preparation of fi nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly refl ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of fi nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the fi nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting

Because of the inherent limitations of internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal fi nancial control over fi nancial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Opinion

In our opinion, the Holding Company, its subsidiary companies, and joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, have, maintained in all material respects, an adequate internal fi nancial controls system over fi nancial reporting and such internal fi nancial controls over fi nancial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2018, based on the internal control over fi nancial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

- ï ï· ï  certain fi nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost depending on the classifi cation;

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.

## 1.4 Signifi cant accounting policies

## a) Functional currency

These consolidated fi nancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All fi nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these entities are largely restricted to the import of fi nished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash fl ows realised from sale of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The costs incurred by these subsidiaries are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The fi nancing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions, unless use of a different currency is considered appropriate.

## b) Basis of consolidation

## Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The fi nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated fi nancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. For the purpose of preparing these consolidated fi nancial statements, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company.

## Joint arrangements (equity accounted investees)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the Company has joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic fi nancial and operating decisions.

A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identifi ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest ("NCI") holders have certain signifi cant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in signifi cant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated fi nancial statements, the accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company.

## Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated fi nancial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Company's interest in the investee.

## Acquisition of non-controlling interests

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the difference arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash fl ows are classifi ed as fi nancing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Loss of Control

Upon loss of control, the Company derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or defi cit arising on the loss of control is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. If the Company retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as a FVTOCI or FVTPL fi nancial asset, depending on the level of infl uence retained.

## c) Business combinations and goodwill

In accordance with the provisions of Ind AS 101, First time adoption of Indian Accounting Standards, the Group has elected to apply accounting for business combinations prospectively from transition date i.e., 1 April 2015. As such, Indian GAAP balances relating to business combinations entered into before that date, including goodwill, have been carried forward.

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The Company measures goodwill as of the applicable acquisition date at the fair value of the consideration transferred, including the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount of the identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

When the fair value of the net identifi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the consideration transferred, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in the OCI and accumulates the same in equity as capital reserve where there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase else the gain is directly recognised in equity as capital reserve. Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Company. Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration. Consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships and employee service related payments. Any goodwill that arises on account of such business combination is tested annually for impairment.

Any contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration that meets the defi nition of a fi nancial instrument is classifi ed as equity, then it is not re-measured and the settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, other contingent consideration is re-measured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

A contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably.

On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Company recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifi able net assets. Transaction costs that the Company incurs in connection with a business combination, such as fi nder's fees, legal fees, due diligence fees and other professional and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.

However, the following assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at the basis indicated below:

- ï ï ï· ï  Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and the assets or liabilities related to employee benefi t arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with Ind AS 12, Income Taxes and Ind AS 19, Employee Benefi ts respectively.
- ï ï ï· ï  Liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payments arrangements of the Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with Ind AS 102, Share-based Payment at the acquisition date.
- ï ï ï· ï  Assets (or disposal groups) that are classifi ed as held for sale in accordance with Ind AS 105, Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that standard.
- ï ï ï· ï  Reacquired rights are measured at a value determined on the basis of the remaining contractual term of the related contract. Such valuation does not consider potential renewal of the reacquired right.

## d) Current and non-current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Assets:

An asset is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classifi ed as current when it satisfi es any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets/liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets/liabilities respectively. All other assets/liabilities are classifi ed as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always disclosed as non-current.

## e) Foreign currencies

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous fi nancial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise with the exception of the following:

- ï ï ï· ï  Exchange differences arising on monetary items that forms part of a reporting entity's net investment in a foreign operation are recognised in profi t or loss in the separate fi nancial statements of the reporting entity or the individualfi nancial statements of the foreign operation, as appropriate. In the fi nancial statements that include the foreign operation and the reporting entity (e.g., consolidated fi nancial statements when the foreign operation is a subsidiary), such exchange differences are recognised initially in OCI. These exchange differences are reclassifi ed from equity to profi t or loss on disposal of the net investment;
- ï ï ï· ï  Exchange differences arising on monetary items that are designated as part of the hedge of the Group's net investment of a foreign operation. These are recognised in OCI until the net investment is disposed of, at which time, the cumulative amount is reclassifi ed to profi t or loss;
- ï ï ï· ï  Tax charges and credits attributable to exchange differences on those monetary items are also recorded in OCI; and
- ï ï ï· ï  Qualifying cash fl ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are effective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash fl ows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## Foreign operations

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in other comprehensive income/(loss) and presented within equity as a part of foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR").

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the presentation currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the presentation currency at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income/(loss) and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the FCTR is transferred to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## f) Revenue

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts, allowances, goods and services tax (GST) and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

Revenue from sales of generic products in India is recognised upon delivery of products to distributors by clearing and forwarding agents of the Company. Signifi cant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of generic products are transferred by the Company when the goods are delivered to distributors from clearing and forwarding agents. Clearing and forwarding agents are generally compensated on a commission basis as a percentage of sales made by them. Revenue from sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates in India is recognised on delivery of products to customers (generally formulation manufacturers), from the factories of the Company, at which point all the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred.

Revenue from export sales and other sales outside of India is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership of products are transferred to the customers, which occurs upon delivery of the products to the customers unless the terms of the applicable contract provide for specifi c revenue generating activities to be completed, in which case revenue is recognised once all such activities are completed.

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profi t share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profi t share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profi ts, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confi rmation of units sold and net sales or net profi t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profi t share component is recognised as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profi t share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profi t share is available. Otherwise, recognition is deferred to a subsequent period pending satisfaction of such collectability and measurability requirements. In measuring the amount of profi t share revenue to be recognised for each period, the Company uses all available information and evidence, including any confi rmations from the business partner of the profi t share amount owed to the Company, to the extent made available before the date the Company's Board of Directors authorises the issuance of its fi nancial statements for the applicable period.

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive, or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to refl ect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition upon the expiration of limited competition or exclusivity periods. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better refl ect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be offered.

## Sales Returns

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## g) Interest income and dividend

Interest income primarily comprises of interest from term deposits with banks. Interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life of the fi nancial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the fi nancial asset. Interest income is included in other income in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Dividend income is recognised when the Company's right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend.

## h) Government grants

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented in the balance sheet by setting up the grant as deferred income. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signifi cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## i) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for fi nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences:

- ï ï ï· ï  the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profi t;
- ï ï ï· ï  differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- ï ï ï· ï  taxable temporary differences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefi t will be realised.

The Company recognises deferred tax liability for all taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except to the extent that both of the following conditions are satisfi ed:

- a) When the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference; and
- b) it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised intercompany profi t or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

## j) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profi t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## k) Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. General and specifi c borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefi ts embodied within the part will fl ow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. Land is not depreciated.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life, whichever is shorter.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and, if expectations differ from previous estimates, the change(s) are accounted for as a change in an accounting estimate in accordance with Ind AS 8, Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors .

## The estimated useful lives are as follows:

|                                            | YEARS          |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Buildings                                  |                |
| - Factory and administrative buildings     | 20 b  to b  50 |
| - Ancillary structures                     | 3 b  to b  15  |
| Plant and machinery                        | 3 to 15        |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to 10        |
| Vehicles                                   | 4 to 5         |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible fi xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date is disclosed as capital advances under other non-current assets. The cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under capital work-in-progress. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated.

## l) Goodwill and other intangible assets

| Goodwill                                                                                        | Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of non- controlling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the identifi able net assets acquired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The Company's  criteria for capitalisation of such assets are consistent with the guidance given in paragraph  25 of Indian Accounting Standard 38 ("Ind AS 38") (i.e., receipt of economic benefi ts out of  the separately purchased transaction is considered to be probable).                    |
| In-Process Research  and Development  assets ("IPR&D") or  Intangible assets under  development | Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are  recognised as In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or Intangible assets  under development. IPR&D assets are not amortised, but evaluated for potential impairment  on an annual basis or when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.                                                                                                        |
| Subsequent expenditure                                                                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Other intangible assets                                                                         | Subsequent expenditures are capitalised only when they increase the future economic  benefi ts embodied in the specifi c asset to which they relate. All other expenditures, including  expenditures on internally generated goodwill and brands, is recognised in the consolidated  statement of profi t and loss as incurred.                                                                                                                                                 |
| In-Process Research  and Development  assets ("IPR&D") or  Intangible assets under  development | Subsequent expenditure on an in-process research or development project acquired  separately or in a business combination and recognised as an intangible asset is: a) recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is research expenditure; b) recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is development expenditure that does not satisfy the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38; and                                           |

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets or on any other basis that refl ects the pattern in which the asset's future economic benefi ts are expected to be consumed by the entity. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| b                                   | YEARS           |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Trademarks with fi nite useful life | 3 b  to b  12 b |
| Product related intangibles         | 5 to 15 b       |
| Customer contracts                  | 1 to 11         |
| Technical know-how                  | 3 to 13 b       |
| Other intangibles                   | 3 to 15 b       |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a fi nite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

Intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefi nite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefi ts are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as on the date of de-recognition.

## m) Leases

At the inception of each lease, the lease arrangement is classifi ed as either a fi nance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement. A lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership to the lessee is classifi ed as a fi nance lease. All other leases are classifi ed as operating leases.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is recognised as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalised and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under fi nance leases are apportioned between the fi nance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The fi nance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognised on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless the payments to the lessor are structured to increase in line with expected general infl ation to compensate for the lessor's expected infl ationary cost increases.

Operating lease incentives received from the landlord are recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight line basis over the lease term.

## n) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and fi nished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of fi nished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares, that do not qualify to be recognised as property, plant and equipment, consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the allowance for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to refl ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## o) Impairment of non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-fi nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefi nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defi ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash infl ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash infl ows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefi t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cashgenerating units are allocated fi rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in an associate is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in an associate is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in an associate may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, and reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## p) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefi ts are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defi ned contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefi t plans and other post-employment benefi ts is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outfl ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefi ts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefi t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defi ned benefi t plan, recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in employee benefi t expense, refl ects the increase in the defi ned benefi t obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefi t changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefi t obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefi t expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefi ts are recognised as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefi ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Termination benefi ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefi ts is the amount of future benefi t that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefi t is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the balance sheet date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary. Re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Equity settled share-based payments

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payments

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the sharebased payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## q) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outfl ow of economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash fl ows at a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specifi c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outfl ow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outfl ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

## Contingent assets

Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated fi nancial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an infl ow of economic benefi ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## r) Financial instruments

A fi nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a fi nancial asset of one entity and a fi nancial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

## Initial recognition and measurement

All fi nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of fi nancial assets not recorded at fair value through profi t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the fi nancial asset. Purchases or sales of fi nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

- ï ï ï· ï  Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- ï ï ï· ï  Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI);
- ï ï ï· ï  Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at fair value through profi t or loss (FVTPL); and
- ï ï ï· ï  Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI).

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and
- b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specifi ed dates to cash fl ows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such fi nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in other income in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A 'debt instrument' is classifi ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash fl ows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) The asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the other comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses & reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassifi ed to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). The Group has not designated any debt instrument as at FVTPL.

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS103 applies are classifi ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group may make an irrevocable election to present in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in the fair value. The Group makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The classifi cation is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fi nancial asset or part of a group of similar fi nancial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Group's consolidated balance sheet) when:

- ï ï ï· ï  The rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired; or
- ï ï ï· ï  The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash fl ows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement Í¾ and either (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group's continuing involvement. In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that refl ects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 18.

For this purpose, the Company follows 'simplifi ed approach' for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of simplifi ed approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classifi ed, at initial recognition, as fi nancial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All fi nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Group's fi nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of fi nancial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss

Financial liabilities at fair value through profi t or loss include fi nancial liabilities held for trading and fi nancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profi t or loss. Financial liabilities are classifi ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative fi nancial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defi ned by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profi t or loss are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfi ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/losses are not subsequently transferred to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The Group has not designated any fi nancial liability as fair value through profi t and loss.

## Loans and borrowings

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as fi nance costs in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A fi nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing fi nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modifi cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, South African rands ("ZAR"), Romanian new leus ("RON") and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias, and Euros.

The Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivative fi nancial instruments) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative fi nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifi es its derivative fi nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classifi ed to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash fl ow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash fl ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain/loss on such non-derivative fi nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassifi ed to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## s) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of our cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash fl ows.

## t) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. Refer Note 2.24 for segment information presented.

Trade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using effective interest method, less provision for impairment.

## v) Trade and other payables

These amounts represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Company prior to the end of the fi nancial year which are unpaid. The amounts are unsecured and are presented as current liabilities unless payment is not due within twelve months after the reporting period. They are recognised initially ate fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

## 1.5 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain fi nancial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specifi c to that asset or liability. A fair value measurement of a non-fi nancial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefi ts by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method after deduction of a fair return on other assets that are part of creating the related cash fl ows.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profi t margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash fl ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For fi nance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have fl oating rates of interest, th eir fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

Consequently, the Company, following the guidance under Ind AS 36 "Impairment of assets", determined that the estimated recoverable amount of the CGU is lower than its carrying cost. Accordingly, an amount of ' 335 (including ' 4 towards capital work-in-progress) was recorded as an impairment during the year ended 31 March 2017. The recoverable amounts of the above cash gener ating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Key assumptions on which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include: (i) Estimated cash fl ows for the r emaining useful life; (ii) Terminal value is considered to be zero; (iii) The post-tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital. The post-tax discount ra tes used was 6.68%. The pre-tax discount rates was 9.02%. b) During the year , the Company has capitalised borrowing costs of ' 70 (31 March 2017: ' 65) with respect to qualifying assets. The rate for capitalisation of interest costs for the ye ars ended 31 Mar ch 2018 and 31 March 2017 was approximately 2.76% and 2.14% respectively. c) As of 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017, the Company was committed to spend ' 3,788 and ' 5,256, respectively, under agreements to purchase property, plant and equipment. T his amount is net of capital advances paid in respect of such purchase commitments.

## SEGMENT REPORTING

The Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by operating segments. The CODM reviews revenue and gross profi t as the performance indicator for all of the operating segments, and does not review the total assets and liabilities of an operating segment. The Chief Executive Offi cer is the CODM of the Company.

The Company's reportable operating segments are as follows:

- ï·ï  Global Generics;
- ï·ï  Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI"); and
- ï·ï  Proprietary Products.

Global Generics: This segment consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing prescription and over -the-counter fi nished pharmaceutical products ready for consumption by the patient, marketed either under a brand name (branded formulations) or as generic fi nished dosages with therapeutic equivalence to branded formulations (generics). This segment includes the operations of the Company's biologics business.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients: This segment consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as "API" or bulk drugs, which are the principal ingredients for fi nished pharmaceutical products. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates become fi nished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fi xed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. This segment also includes the Company's contract research services business and the manufacture and sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients and steroids in accordance with the specifi c customer requirements.

Proprietary Products: This segment consists of the Company's business that focuses on the research, development, and manufacture of differentiated formulations and new chemical entities ("NCEs"). These novel products fall within the dermatology and neurology therapeutic areas and are marketed and sold through Promius Â® Pharma, LLC.

Others: This includes the operations of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited, a discovery stage biotechnology company developing novel and best-in-class therapies in the fi elds of oncology and infl ammation and which works with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in early-stage collaborations, bringing drug candidates from hit generation to pre-clinical development.

The measurement of each segment's revenues, expenses and assets is consistent with the accounting policies that are used in preparation of the Company's consolidated fi nancial statements.

## EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of DRL (the "Committee") administer the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split effected in the form of stock dividend issued by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  RESERVED UNDER  CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  RESERVED UNDER  CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |

Category A - Fair Market Value Options: There was no stock options activity under this category during the year 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 and there were no options outstanding under this category as of 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017.

The weighted average share price on the date of exercise of options during the years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 was ' 2,375 and ' 3,292 per share, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the DRL 2002 Plan during the years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 was ' 342 and ' 584, respectively. As of 31 March 2018, options outstanding under the DRL 2002 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 665 and options exercisable under the DRL 2002 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 98.

The term of the DRL 2002 plan was extended for a period of 10 years effective as of 29 January 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

Dr. Reddy's Employees ADR Stock Option Plan, 2007 (the "DRL 2007 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2007 Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2005. The DRL 2007 Plan became effective upon its approval by the Board of Directors on 22 January 2007. The DRL 2007 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Committee administers the DRL 2007 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2007 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2007 Plan provides for option grants in two categories:

Category A: 382,695 stock options out of the total of 1,530,779 stock options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,148,084 stock options out of the total of 1,530,779 stock options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Stock option activity under the DRL 2007 Plan for the two categories of options during the years ended 31 March 2018 and 2017 is as follows:

Category A - Fair Market Value Options: There were no options granted under this category as of 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017.

## EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS (CONTINUED)

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised under the DRL 2007 Plan during the years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 was ' 57 and ' 110, respectively. As of 31 March 2018, options outstanding under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 223 and options exercisable under the DRL 2007 Plan had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 23.

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company adopted a new program to grant performance linked stock options to certain employees under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan. Under this program, performance targets are measured each year against pre-defi ned interim targets over the three year period ending on 31 March 2017 and eligible employees are granted stock options upon meeting such targets. The stock options so granted are ultimately vested with the employees who meet subsequent service vesting conditions which range from one to four years.After vesting, such stock options generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan and the DRL 2007 Plan has been measured using the Black-ScholesMerton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted under category B, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term, contractual term, as well as expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted under category A, the option life is estimated based on the simplifi ed method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in effect at the time of the grant. These assumptions refl ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is charged to income on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted.

## Equity settled share-based payment expense

For the years ended 31 March 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded employee share-based payment expense of ' 454 and ' 350, respectively. As of 31 March 2018, there was ' 313 of total unrecognised compensation cost related to unvested stock options. This cost is expected to be recognised over a weighted-average period of 1.98 years.

## Cash settled share-based payment expense

Certain of the Company's employees are eligible for share-based payment awards that are settled in cash. These awards entitle the employees to a cash payment, on the exercise date, upon satisfaction of certain service conditions which range from one to four years. The amount of cash payment is determined based on the price of the Company's ADS at the time of exercise. For the years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017, the Company recorded cash settled share-based payment expense of ' 28 and ' 48, respectively. As of 31 March 2018, there was ' 67 of total unrecognised compensation cost related to unvested awards. This cost is expected to be recognised over a weighted-average period of 1.96 years. This Scheme does not involve dealing in or subscribing to or purchasing securities of the Company, directly or indirectly.

## EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Gratuity benefi ts provided by the parent company

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a defi ned benefi t plan which provides for gratuity payments (the "Gratuity Plan") and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. Effective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the "Gratuity Fund") to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by Government of India, corporate debt securities and in equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss for the years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 consist of the following:

The increase in the Company's effective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2018 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2017 was primarily on account of the following:

- ï·ï  re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries in the United States due to the enactment of The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 in the United States on 22 December 2017. Due to this enactment, the Company re-measured its U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new tax law. This resulted in a charge of ' 1,269 for the year ended 31 March 2018, primarily to refl ect the impact on our U.S. deferred tax assets of the reduction in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the new tax law; and
- ï·ï  the foregoing was partially offset by changes in the Company's jurisdictional mix of earnings (i.e., an increase in the proportion of the Company's profi ts from lower tax jurisdictions and a decrease in the proportion of the Company's profi ts from higher tax jurisdictions) for the year ended 31 March 2018, as compared to the year ended 31 March 2017.

The details of unrecognised deferred tax assets and liabilities are summarised below:

|---------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Deductible temporary differences, net | 4,977                  | 3,510                  |
| Operating tax loss carry forward      | 4,030                  | 3,061                  |
|                                       | 9,007                  | 6,571                  |

During the year ended 31 March 2018, the Company did not recognise deferred tax assets of ' 969 on operating tax losses pertaining primarily to Dr. Reddy's Venezuela, C.A. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. During the year ended 31 March 2018, the Company did not recognise deferred tax assets of ' 1,467 on certain deductible temporary differences, as the Company believes that it is not probable that there will be available taxable profi ts against which such temporary differences can be utilised.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of ' 30,923 as at 31 March 2018, of subsidiaries outside India, where it is expected that earnings of the subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. Generally, the Company indefi nitely reinvests all the accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, and accordingly, has not recorded any deferred taxes in relation to such undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. It is impracticable to determine the taxes payable when these earnings are remitted.

## e) Deferred tax assets and liabilities

The tax effects of signifi cant temporary differences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of the items that created these differences is given below:

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the benefi ts of those recognised deductible differences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Operating loss carry forward consists of business losses, unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed interest carry-forwards. A portion of this total loss can be carried indefi nitely and the remaining amounts expire at various dates ranging from 2019 through 2028.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

The changes in fair value of such interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of fi nance cost. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of fi nance cost, a net gain of ' 9 for the year ended 31 March 2018.

As at 31 March 2018, the Company had outstanding interest swap arrangements that hedged a portion of interest rate risk arising from fl oating rate, dollar denominated foreign currency borrowing of US$ 50. As at 31 March 2017, the Company had no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements.

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of fi nancial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to refl ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a) Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sens itivefi nancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias, UK pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in US dollars, Russian roubles and Euros). A signifi cant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a signifi cant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fl uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative fi nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency fi nancial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.33 above.

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- ï·ï  a ' 1,277/(1,338) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an a ' 403/(308) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2018;
- ï·ï  a ' 1,154/(710) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an a ' 2,143/(2,287) increase/(decrease) in the Company's profi t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2017.

The following table analyses foreign currency risk from non-derivative fi nancial instruments as at 31 March 2018:

| Long-term borrowings        | 4,852        | -      | 76                | -            | 4,928   |
| Short-term borrowings       | 13,056       | -      | 4,023             | -            | 17,079  |
| Other financial liabilities | 4,534        | 199    | 1,640             | 628          | 7,001   |
| Total                       | 24,515       | 1,021  | 5,739             | 943          | 32,218  |

For the years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned fi nancial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 175 and ' 316, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2018, the Company had ' 42,592 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate ranging from 1 Month LIBOR minus 30 bps to 1 Month/3 Months LIBOR plus 85 bps. As of 31 March 2017, the Company had ' 41,407 of loans carrying a fl oating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR minus 30 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps and the Indian Treasury Bill plus 30 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate profi les, refer to note 2.8 A and B of these consolidated fi nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017, every 10% increase or decrease in the fl oating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR) applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profi t by ' 77 and ' 46, respectively.

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings designated in a cash fl ow hedge as of 31 March 2018 was ' 3,259. In respect of these borrowings, a 10% decrease/increase in the interest rates of such borrowings would have resulted in a ' 18/(20) increase/ decrease in the Company's hedging reserve as at 31 March 2018.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certifi cates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signifi cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate signifi cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fl uctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2018, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fl uctuations in commodity prices.

## b) Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of fi nancial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a fi nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for credit losses and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is infl uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an infl uence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signifi cant concentration of exposures to specifi c industry sectors or specifi c country risks.

## Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certifi cates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2018. Of the total trade receivables, ' 35,747 as at 31 March 2018 and ' 27,813 as at 31 March 2017 consisted of customer balances that were neither past due nor impaired.

## Financial assets that are past due

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The aging of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired is given below:

| PERIOD (IN DAYS)                  | AS AT  31 MARCH 2018   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2017   |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 - 90                            | 4,510                  | 8,380                  |
| 90 - 180                          | 177                    | 707                    |
| More than 180                     | 1,303                  | 2,231                  |
| Total                             | 5,990                  | 11,318                 |
| Less :  Allowance for credit loss | (1,041)                | (935)                  |
| Net trade receivables             | 4,949                  | 10,383                 |

The Company uses Expected Credit Loss (ECL) model for assessing the impairment loss. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers.

Other than trade receivables, the Company has no signifi cant class of fi nancial assets that is past due but not impaired.

Reconciliation of allowance for credit losses

The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017 are as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                     | FOR THE YEAR ENDED  31 MARCH 2018   | FOR THE YEAR ENDED  31 MARCH 2017   |

| Balance at the end of the year                  | 1,041                               | 935                                 |

## c) Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its fi nancial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As of 31 March 2018 and 31 March 2017, the Company had unutilised credit limits from banks of ' 24,046 and ' 21,156 respectively.

As of 31 March 2018, the Company had working capital of ' 36,046, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 2,638, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certifi cates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 41, investment in bonds of ' 4,633, investment in commercial paper of ' 232 and investments in FVTPL fi nancial assets of ' 14,778. As of 31 March 2017, the Company had working capital of ' 12,638, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 3,865, investments in term deposits (i.e., bank certifi cates of deposit having original maturities of more than 3 months) of ' 3,390 and investments in FVTPL fi nancial assets of ' 10,881.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more signifi cant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is diffi cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected fi nancial effect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case. The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plaintiffs, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse effect on its fi nancial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Norfl oxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Norfl oxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient norfl oxacin. Under the Drugs Prices Control Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "specifi ed product" and fi x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a notifi cation and designated Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" and fi xed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company fi led a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while fi xing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company fi led a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by fi ling a Special Leave Petition.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Norfl oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price fi xed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest. The Company fi led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company fi led an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA fi led a counter affi davit stating that the inclusion of Norfl oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of exper ts in the fi eld. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Norfl oxacin as a "specifi ed product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings.

During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the fi xing of prices for Norfl oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Norfl oxacin was fi led by the Company with the Delhi High Court. Upon the request of the respondents to fi le a counter, the Delhi High Court has adjourned the matter to 26 November 2018.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain notifi cations regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and anti-diabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, fi led a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the notifi cations issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition fi led by the IPA and upheld the validity of the notifi cations/orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the notifi ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA fi led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016.This recall application fi led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA fi led a Special Leave Petition, with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had fi led, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company fi led a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice.

Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to fi le a fi nal counter affi davit within six weeks subsequent to which the Company could fi le a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter affi davit was fi led by the Union of India. The Company subsequently fi led a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 8 August 2018 for hearing.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 416 under "selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notifi ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

Other product and patent related matters

## Nexium United States litigations

Five federal antitrust class action lawsuits were brought on behalf of direct purchasers of NexiumÂ®, and ten federal class action lawsuits were brought under both state and federal law on behalf of end-payors of NexiumÂ®. These actions were fi led against various generic manufacturers, including the Company and its U.S. subsidiary Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. These actions were consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The complaints alleged that AstraZeneca and the involved generic manufacturers settled patent litigation related to NexiumÂ® capsules in a manner that violated antitrust laws. The Company consistently maintained that its conduct complied with all applicable laws and that the complaints were without merit. In response to a motion for summary judgement made by the Company, the Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part, fi nding that the plaintiffs had failed to demonstrate that the Company's settlement of patent litigation with AstraZeneca included any large or unjustifi ed reverse payment, but preserving other claims for trial.

On 20 October 2014, the Company reached a settlement with all plaintiffs who had cases pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The settlement with the class plaintiffs was subject to the Court's approval. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company made no payment to the class plaintiffs. Other defendants went to trial and prevailed.

The Court granted preliminary approval of the Company's settlements with the class plaintiffs on 28 January 2015, and granted fi nal approval of such settlements on 29 September 2015.

On 21 November 2016, the First Circuit Court of Appeals affi rmed the judgement that had been entered in favour of the defendants who tried the case to a verdict. On 10 January 2017, the First Circuit Court of Appeals denied the motions for reconsideration.

In addition, two complaints, similar in nature to those referenced above, were fi led in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by plaintiffs who chose to opt out of the class action lawsuit. No dispositive motions have been fi led in these actions.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of lawsuits of the plaintiffs who opted out of the class action is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Child resistant packaging matter

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged in a letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the "CPSA") and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the "PPPA") and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Specifi cally, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certifi cates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC's allegations.

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") began to investigate a sealed complaint which was fi led in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") related to these same issues (the "FCA Complaint"). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plaintiff whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the Company, proceeded without the DOJ's and applicable States' involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company's generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company fi led its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and allowing the plaintiffs one more chance to refi le this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations. On 29 March 2017, the plaintiffs fi led their fi nal amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plaintiffs fi led a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ's offi ce in Washington, D.C. in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ relates to fi ve of the blister pack products.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for a civil penalty of US$ 5 million ( ' 319) and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the Company has not admitted any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

## Namenda United States Litigations

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health & Welfare Fund ("Sergeants") fi led suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the Alzheimer's drug NamendaÂ® (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009 until 2010. Sergeants seeks to represent a class of "end-payor" purchasers of NamendaÂ® tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding NamendaÂ® tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator's attempt to shift sales from the original immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product. The Company believes that the complaint lacks merit and that the Company's conduct complied with all applicable laws and regulations.

All defendants, including the Company, moved to dismiss the claims. On 13 September 2016, the Court denied these motions. However, the Sergeants case is stayed pending resolution of similar claims in another case in which the Company is not a party ( JM Smith Corp. v. Actavis PLC ). The parties in the JM Smith case have served the Company with subpoenas, in response to which the Company produced the specifi c documents subpoenaed and provided testimony in a deposition.

Four other class action complaints, each containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint, have also been fi led in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. However, two of those complaints were voluntarily dismissed, and the other two do not name the Company as a defendant.

In addition, the State of New York fi led an antitrust case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set forth in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of alleged violation of federal antitrust laws is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were fi led against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plaintiffs allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More specifi cally, the plaintiffs allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plaintiffs in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plaintiffs right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were fi led against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multi-product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to fi x prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States. In March 2017, plaintiffs agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of any of these complaints is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements.

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") fi led a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udenafi l (a patented compound) and an udenafi l fi nished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and fi nished dosage forms of udenafi l and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the fi ling of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. In this regard, the C ompany fi led a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. Company's interlocutory appeal of the said denial, was also denied.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this complaint is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (iii) Shareholder Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was fi led against the Company, its Chief Executive Offi cer, and its Chief Financial Offi cer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Offi cer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public fi lings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were affected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants fi led a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of this complaint is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the consolida ted fi nancial statements of the Company.

## (iv) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action fi led a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company along with the alleged polluting industries has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently fi led a review petition against the judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017, in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not material to the consolidated fi nancial statements. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2018.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specifi ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-fi nding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notifi cation in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notifi cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notifi cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (v) Indirect taxes related matters

## Distribution of input service tax credits

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various demand notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED                               | STATUS                                                     |

| April 2013 to March 2014          | '  69 plus interest and penalties             | The Company has fi led an appeal before the CESTAT.        |
| April 2014 to March 2015          | '  108 plus interest and penalties            | The Company has fi led an appeal before the CESTAT.        |
| April 2015 to March 2016          | '  157 plus interest and penalties            | The Company is in the process of responding to the notice. |

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in these consolidat ed fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2018.

## Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company has received various demand notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such demand notice, the amount demanded and the current status of the Company's responsive actions.

| PERIOD COVERED UNDER THE NOTICE   | AMOUNT DEMANDED        | STATUS                                                                                 |

| April 2011 to March 2013          | '  16 plus 10% penalty | The Appellate Deputy Commissioner issued an order  partially in favour of the Company. |

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 27 as of 31 March 2018, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

## Others

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various demand notices from the Indian Sales and Service Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 278. The Company has responded to such demand notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2018.

## CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

## (vi) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions fi led by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition fi led by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

## (vii) Direct taxes related matters

The Company is contesting various disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 1,727. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavourable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and, accordingly, no provision is made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2018.

During the years ended 31 March 2014, 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2016, Industrias Quimicas Falcon de Mexico, S.A. de CV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico, received a notice from Mexico's Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria ("SAT"), with respect to disallowance on account of transfer pricing adjustments pertaining to the calendar years ended 31 December 2006, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The associated tax impact is ' 703 (MXN 196.9 million). The Company fi led administrative appeals with the SAT by challenging these disallowances and, during February and March 2017, the Company received orders of the SAT confi rming these disallowances by dismissing its administrative appeals.The Company disagrees with the SAT's disallowances and fi led an appeal with the Tribunal Federal de Justicia Administrativa (Federal Tax and Administrative Court of Mexico) in March and April 2017.

The Company believes that possibility of any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2018.

## (viii) Others

Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse effect on its consolidated fi nancial statements.

## COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH CURIS, INC.

On 18 January 2015, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited ("Aurigene"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent company, entered into a Collaboration, License and Option Agreement (the "Collaboration Agreement") with Curis, Inc. ("Curis") to discover, develop and commercialise small molecule antagonists for immuno-oncology and precision oncology targets.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene has the responsibility for conducting all discovery and preclinical activities, including Investigational New Drug ("IND") enabling studies and providing Phase 1 clinical trial supply, and Curis is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory and commercialisation efforts worldwide, excluding India and Russia. The Collaboration Agreement provides that the parties will collaborate exclusively in immuno-oncology for an initial period of approximately two years, with the option for Curis to extend the broad immuno-oncology exclusivity.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH CURIS, INC. (CONTINUED)

As partial consideration for the collaboration, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 18 January 2015, Curis issued to Aurigene 17,120,131 shares of its common stock, representing 19.9% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to the transaction (approximately 16.6% of its outstanding common stock immediately after the transaction). Such shares were initially subject to a lock-up agreement. However, as of 31 March 2017, lock-up restrictions were released on all of the aforementioned 17,120,131 shares. In connection with the issuance of such shares, Curis and Aurigene entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated 18 January 2015 which provides for certain registration rights with respect to resale of the shares. The common stock of Curis is listed for quotation on the NASDAQ Global Market.

The fair value of the shares of Curis common stock on the date of the Stock Purchase Agreement was ' 1,452 (US$ 23.5 million).

Revenues under the Collaboration Agreement consist of upfront consideration (including the shares of Curis common stock) and the development and commercial milestone payments described below, which are deferred and recognised as revenue over the period for which Aurigene has continuing performance obligations.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene is entitled to development and commercial milestone payments as follows:

- ï·ï  for the fi rst two programs: up to US$ 52.5 million per program, including US$ 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any;
- ï·ï  for the third and fourth programs: up to US$ 50 million per program, including US$ 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any; and
- ï·ï  for any program thereafter: up to US$ 140.5 million per program, including US$ 87.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any.

In addition, Curis has agreed to pay Aurigene royalties, ranging between high single digits to 10%, on its net sales in territories where it commercialises products. Furthermore, Aurigene is entitled to receive a share of Curis' revenues from sublicenses, which share varies based upon specifi ed factors such as the sublicensed territory, whether the sublicense revenue is royalty based or non-royalty based and, in some cases, the stage of the applicable molecule and product at the time the sublicense is granted.

On 7 September 2016, the Collaboration Agreement was amended to provide for the issuance to Aurigene of 10,208,333 additional shares of Curis common stock in lieu of receiving up to US$ 24.5 million of milestone and other payments from Curis that could have become due under the Collaboration Agreement. These shares of Curis common stock are recorded at US$ 1.84 per share, which is equal to the market price of such shares of common stock on the date of issuance, amounting to an aggregate market value of ' 1,247 (US$ 18.8 million).

These additional shares are also subject to a lock-up agreement, which is similar to the lock-up for the original Curis shares the Company received. However, this lock-up remains effective until 7 September 2018, with shares being released from such lock-up in 25% increments on each of 7 March 2017, 7 September 2017, 7 March 2018 and 7 September 2018, subject to acceleration of release of all the shares in connection with a change of control of Curis. As of 31 March 2018, lock-up restrictions were released on an aggregate of 7,656,250 of such additional shares of Curis common stock, representing 75% of the shares which Aurigene received from Curis in 2016.

The Company has evaluated the transaction under Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, and believes that the Company does not have any signifi cant infl uence with respect to Curis. Accordingly, all of the shares of Curis common stock are classifi ed as instruments at fair value through OCI. The fair value of the investments as on 31 March 2018 is ' 1,164.

This arrangement is accounted for as a joint operation under Ind AS 111.

## ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH TEVA PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LIMITED

On 10 June 2016, the Company entered into a defi nitive purchase agreement with Teva and an affi liate of Allergan plc ("Allergan") to acquire eight ANDAs in the United States for US$ 350 million in cash at closing. The acquired products were divested by Teva as a precondition to the closing of its acquisition of Allergan's generics business. The acquisition of these ANDAs was also contingent on the closing of the Teva/Allergan generics purchase transaction and approval by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

The acquisition was consummated on 3 August 2016 upon the completion of all closing conditions, and the Company paid US$ 350 million as the consideration for the acquired ANDAs.

Tabulated below are the details of products acquired and the respective purchase prices in US$ million along with the corresponding amount in ' as of the payment date:

## RECEIPT OF WARNING LETTER FROM THE U.S. FDA

The Company received a warning letter dated 5 November 2015 from the U.S. FDA relating to current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMPs") deviations at its active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") manufacturing facilities at Srikakulam, Andhra Pradesh and Miryalaguda, Telangana, as well as violations at its oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh. The contents of the warning letter emanated from Form 483 observations that followed inspections of these sites by the U.S. FDA in November 2014, January 2015 and February-March 2015.

The warning letter does not restrict production or shipment of the Company's products from these facilities. However, unless and until the Company is able to correct outstanding issues to the U.S. FDA's satisfaction, the U.S. FDA may withhold approval of new products and new drug applications of the Company, refuse admission of products manufactured at the facilities noted in the warning letter into the United States, and/or take additional regulatory or legal action against the Company. Any such further action could have a material and negative impact on the Company's ongoing business and operations. During the years ended 31 March 2016, 31 March 2017 and 31 March 2018, the U.S. FDA withheld approval of new products from these facilities pending resolution of the issues identifi ed in the warning letter. To minimise the business impact, the Company transferred certain key products to alternate manufacturing facilities.

Subsequent to the issuance of the warning letter, the Company promptly instituted corrective actions and preventive actions and submitted a comprehensive response to the warning letter to the U.S. FDA, followed by periodic written updates and in-person meetings with the U.S. FDA. The U.S. FDA completed the re-inspection of the aforementioned manufacturing facilities in the months of February , March and April 2017. During the re-inspections, the U.S. FDA issued three observations with respect to the API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda, two observations with respect to the API manufacturing facility at Srikakulam and thirteen observations with respect to the Company's oncology formulation manufacturing facility at Duvvada. The Company has responded to these observations identifi ed by the U.S. FDA, and believes that it can resolve them in a timely manner.

In June 2017, the U.S. FDA issued an Establishment Inspection Report ("EIR") which indicated that the inspection of the Company's API manufacturing facility at Miryalaguda is successfully closed. With regard to the Company's oncology manufacturing facility at Duvvada and its API manufacturing facility at Srikakulam, the Company received EIRs from the U.S. FDA in November 2017 and February 2018, respectively, which indicated that the inspection status of these facilities remains unchanged.

## Inspection of other facilities:

In May and June 2017, inspection of the Company's Formulations Srikakulam Plan (SEZ) Unit II and I, India, was completed by the U.S. FDA with zero and one observations, respectively, and the U.S. FDA issued EIRs in September 2017 for both Units II and I, indicating the closure of the audit for these facilities.

The inspection of the Company's Custom Pharmaceutical Services facility in Hyderabad, India was completed by the U.S. FDA on 21 September 2017 with zero observations, and the U.S. FDA issued an EIR in December 2017 indicating the closure of audit for this facility.

In April 2017, inspection of the Company's formulations manufacturing facility at Bachupally, Hyderabad was completed by the U.S. FDA and the Company was issued a Form 483 with 11 observations. In December 2017, the U.S. FDA issued an EIR which indicates the closure of the audit for this facility.

In July 2017, inspection of the Company's API facility in Cuernavaca, Mexico was completed by the U.S. FDA with zero observations, and the U.S. FDA issued an EIR in April 2018 indicating the closure of the audit for this facility.

## 2.41 RECEIPT OF WARNING LETTER FROM THE U.S. FDA (CONTINUED)

The inspection of the Company's API facility in Mirfi eld, United Kingdom was completed by the U.S. FDA on 15 September 2017, and the Company was issued a Form 483 with three observations. The Company responded to the observations identifi ed by the U.S. FDA, and the U.S. FDA issued an EIR on 24 April 2018, which indicates the closure of the audit for this facility.

In March 2018, inspection of two of the Company's API manufacturing facilities namely, the API Hyderabad Plant 1 and the API Hyderabad Plant 3, was completed by the U.S. FDA with four and fi ve observations, respectively. The observations at API Hyderabad Plant 3 were related to procedures and facility maintenance. The Company has responded to the observations relating to both these facilities and believes that it can address all these observations comprehensively in a timely manner.

## INSPECTION BY THE REGULATORY AUTHORITY OF BAVARIA, GERMANY

In August 2017, the Company's German subsidiary betapharm Arzneimittel GmbH received a letter from a regulatory authority of Bavaria, Germany (the Regierung von Oberbayern, which is the Central Authority for Supervision of Medicinal Products in Bavaria of the Upper Bavarian government) (the "Regulator"), that the GMP compliance certifi cate for the Company's formulations manufacturing facility at Bachupally, Hyderabad was not renewed as the result of GMP compliance deviations identifi ed in an inspection. Consequently, this manufacturing facility was not permitted to export products to the European Union (the "EU") until satisfactory resolution of the issues identifi ed in the inspection and renewal of the facility's GMP compliance certifi cate. The manufacturing facility was re-inspected in January 2018 and the status of non-compliance was withdrawn. The facility is now permitted to dispatch approved products to the EU.

Furthermore, on 7 September 2017, the Regulator concluded an inspection of the Company's formulations manufacturing facility at Duvvada, Visakhapatnam, with zero critical and six major observations. Products manufactured at the facility are not currently exported to the EU. The Company submitted a Corrective and Preventive Action Plan ("CAPA") to the Regulator in this regard which was accepted by the Regulator. Consequently, the Regulator permitted the Company to start production from this facility for the EU market. The German Regulator intends to re-inspect this facility by the end of calendar year 2018.

## 2.43 CHANGE IN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY OF A FOREIGN OPERATION

Until 31 July 2016, the functional currency of Dr. b Reddy's Laboratories, SA, one of the Company's subsidiaries in Switzerland (the "Swiss Subsidiary"), was determined to be the Indian rupee. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Swiss Subsidiary borrowed US$ 350 million from certain institutional lenders to acquire eight ANDAs in the United States (Refer note 2.38). The Company believes that the aforesaid transactions had signifi cant impact on the primary economic environment of the Swiss Subsidiary and, accordingly, the Swiss Subsidiary's operating, investing and fi nancing activities will have a greater reliance on the United States dollar.

Accordingly, effective 1 August 2016, the functional currency of the Swiss Subsidiary was changed to the United States dollar. The change in functional currency of the Swiss subsidiary was applied prospectively from date of change in accordance with Ind AS 21, The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rate .

## RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

Standards issued but not yet effective and not early adopted by the Company:

Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In March 2018, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs ("MCA") has notifi ed Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2018. This comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance, and requires an entity to recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that refl ects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new standard also will result in enhanced disclosures about revenue, provide guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed comprehensively (for example, service revenue and contract modifi cations) and improve guidance for multiple-element arrangements.

Ind AS 115 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2018.

The Company intends to adopt Ind AS 115 effective 1 April 2018, using the modifi ed retrospective method.The adoption of Ind AS 115 is not expected to have a signifi cant impact on the Company's recognition of revenues from product sales, service income and license fee.

## Other amendments

On 28 March 2018, the MCA, issued certain amendments to Ind AS. The amendments relate to the following standards:

- ï·ï  Ind AS 40, Investment Property
- ï·ï  Ind AS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
- ï·ï  Ind AS 12, Income Taxes
- ï·ï  Ind AS 28, Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
- ï·ï  Ind AS 112, Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities

The amendments are effective 1 April 2018. The Company believes that the aforementioned amendments will not materially impact the fi nancial position, performance or the cash fl ows of the Company.

In terms of Section 149 and other applicable provisions of the Companies Act, 2013, Mr. Puri was appointed as an independent director for a period of four years at the 30th AGM of the Company held on 31 July 2014. Accordingly his fi rst term as an independent director, after the provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 became effective, is ending on 27 July 2018 (the date of 34th AGM).

His presence will be critical in the process of refreshing the Board composition in a gradual manner and to maintain continuity during the Board's transition. In July 2019, b four directors complete their term. b We intend to seek shareholder approval for a sub set of these board members for terms varying from 2 to 4 years. b We also intend to elect two new board members this year. b Given this signifi cant transition of the board, it will be in the best interest of the Company to extend Mr. Puri's tenure as a board member for a period to help the board maintain continuity in the face of change in composition of the Board in addition to the changes in the management team and the competitive dynamics of the industry.

Mr. Puri, chairperson of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee and the lead independent director continues to give strategic directions/guidance to the Company, till his successor is identifi ed and appointed. The strategic guidance from Mr. Puri by virtue of his deep insight into industry as well as hands on experience in consultancy for more than four decades are of paramount value. More so, in view of the recent signifi cant restructuring of the senior leadership within the organisation, as well as the adverse market dynamics and unforeseen shifts in the competitive landscape.

It is under these circumstances that the board of directors propose to reappoint Mr. Puri, as an independent director for a second term for a period of one year only, against a second term of up to fi ve years as allowed under the Companies Act.

Furthermore, the NYSE Listed Company Manual provides that the Audit Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee and Compensation Committee members must be independent. Also a lead director has to be an independent director as per the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange Inc.

Section 149(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, provides that an independent director shall hold offi ce for a term up to fi ve consecutive years on the board of a Company but shall be eligible for reappointment, for another term of up to fi ve years, on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders.

The Company has received (i) intimation in form DIR-8 pursuant to rule 14 of the Companies (Appointment and Qualifi cation of Directors) Rules, 2014, from Mr. Puri to the effect that he is not disqualifi ed in accordance with Section 164(2) of the Companies Act, 2013; (ii) declaration that he meets the criteria of independence as provided in Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013; and (iii) a notice in writing from a member under Section 160 of the Act proposing the candidature of Mr. Puri as a director of the Company.

In terms of Section 152 and Schedule IV of the Companies Act, 2013, outcome of performance evaluation for FY2018 and recommendations of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, the Board is of the opinion that Mr. Puri fulfi ls the conditions for his reappointment as an independent director as specifi ed in the Companies Act, 2013 and the Listing Regulations and is independent of the management.

Pursuant to Regulation 6 of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee Benefi ts) Regulations, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as the 'SEBI SBEB Regulations'), the Company is seeking approval of its members by way of a special resolution to offer 2018 ESOS to eligible employees (as defi ned herein below).

The special resolution set out at Item No. 7 proposes to cover the employees of the subsidiary(ies) of the Company (present/ future) under 2018 ESOS.

In accordance with the SEBI SBEB Regulations, the shares for the purposes of 2018 ESOS are proposed to be allotted directly to the optionee (including custodian for the purpose of issuing ADRs to such optionees) or to the trust by way of primary issuance by the Company and/or by transfer of shares acquired by way of secondary acquisition by the trust. For the purposes of implementing the aforesaid, it is proposed to set-up a 'Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust' ('ESOS Trust'). However, any ADRs underlying the stock options would not be issued to or held by the ESOS Trust and the same would be implemented directly by the Company through the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee.

The special resolutions set out at item nos. 8 & 9 propose to authorize the board of directors including Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee to delegate the administration of the 2018 ESOS with respect to stock options to be granted against equity shares to the ESOS Trust to the extent considered necessary or desirable and to authorize the ESOS Trust to acquire equity shares of the Company from the secondary market.
