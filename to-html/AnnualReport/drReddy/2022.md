## Letter from Chairman and Co-Chairman

## The year in context

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Dear Shareholder,

FY'22 proved to be yet another eventful year. Having started with the second wave of COVID-19 in India, it ended on a note of high geopolitical tension.

On the pandemic front, the vaccination programmes undertaken in India and around the world have truly played a stellar role in containing its impact. Given its size, numbers and demographic spread, India's vaccination programme was nothing short of remarkable. Subsequent waves have so far exhibited lower severity in India. Our company continued to play its part along with the rest of the pharma industry in the fight against COVID-19. We combined our in-house efforts with an open-innovation model of partnerships to make available a portfolio that included a vaccine, and therapeutics for mild, moderate and severe COVID-19. Our focus on agility, access and affordability helped us reach over 5 million patients during the pandemic, and we remain ready and vigilant to serve any present or future needs.

We join the world in hoping for a resolution to the prolonged geopolitical hostilities between Russia and Ukraine. We have had a three-decade long presence in the region. Ensuring the well-being of our staff in Ukraine and Russia was our first and foremost priority, along with measures to meet patient needs and business continuity. We acted early to secure our resilience, be it employee safety, currency hedging or cash flow.

## Performance and business highlights

FY'22 was a year of good financial performance with growth in sales and EBITDA, and strong cash flow generation from operations. Revenue stood at ' 21,439 cr or $2.83 billion, a year-on-year growth of 13%, based

on improvement in our base business volumes and new product launches. The full-year EBITDA of 24% is close to our aspirational target of 25%. Our North America Generics business recorded a revenue of one billion dollars driven by high-value launches such as Icosapent Ethyl softgel and Vasopressin injection. We were also able to ramp up the market share of many of our existing products, helping us partially mitigate the impact of price erosion. Our Branded Markets (India and Emerging Markets) business registered a strong show and a combined revenue of over a billion dollars. Our Europe generics unit performed well bolstered by new launches, and we expect the growth momentum to continue. Overall, we saw improved market share in most of our major markets. On the API and services front, the year witnessed normalisation in channel customer stocking and we expect return to growth in the business in the coming fiscal. In FY'22, we filed 10 Drug Master Files and seven ANDAs in the U.S., and launched 157 products across markets. The number of product filings in the year was slightly lower than previous years but we remain on track to accelerate this in FY'23.

Additionally, our strong balance sheet allows us to remain open to value-accretive inorganic opportunities. We recently acquired the cardiovascular brand Cidmus®, and in FY'22 also licensed the Voveran® range for pain management, the Calcium range and Methergine® in India. We entered the highly-regulated pharmaceutical cannabis market in Germany through the acquisition of Nimbus Health GmbH to target the CNS segment. We have taken very early steps in the digital healthcare space through our wholly-owned subsidiary SVAAS - an integrated outpatient platform offering, our first foray into digital services.

## Gearing up to meet the next and the new patient needs

All of the above are an illustration of our strategy in action. Over the years, we have reiterated our three strategy pillars - leadership in chosen spaces (leading to market leadership), continuous improvement and operational excellence (leading to productivity), and patient-centric product innovation (to meet unmet needs). Our three-year compounded annual revenue growth at 12 percent, and EBITDA and ROCE close to our target at 25%, are evidence of effective implementation and the soundness of our strategy.

Our core businesses of API, generics, branded generics, biosimilars, and OTC constitute our near-term growth drivers or what we call our horizon 1 of growth ('The Next'). We aim to continue to deliver growth and profitability of these businesses through improved execution on product development and launch, improved productivity driven by continuous improvement as well as digitalization.

As the pharmaceutical landscape evolves, we see intense competition in traditional generics, disruption brought on by new players and new business models, and demand for holistic healthcare solutions. As a company with a history of deep science that has led to several industry firsts, we continue to plan ahead and invest in businesses of the future. These include deepening our presence in nutraceuticals, the discovery and development of immuno-oncology NCEs at our subsidiary Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited and strengthening our CDMO services. We are also exploring new spaces such as digital healthcare services, clinically differentiated assets, biologics and cell & gene therapy, and disease management. Together, we see these businesses as our horizon 2 of growth, i.e., long-term growth prospects ('The New').

## Sustainability - aiming to touch over 1.5 bn patients by 2030

Even as we work on our growth strategy, we realise that embracing sustainability is key to a healthy future for all our stakeholders. The challenges posed by climate change, lack of access, changing patterns of disease burden and inequity need urgent action from us as a collective. We have always viewed our work in the context of addressing societal needs - where we are uniquely positioned to make positive change and impact. This led us to become an early adopter of

Environment Social Governance (ESG) actions as well as voluntary disclosures on sustainability. We released our first Sustainability Report in the year 2004 and have maintained annual disclosures since then. Subsequently, we led the industry in introducing a 'sustainability by design' approach in our operations in 2013. Over the years, our efforts in various aspects of ESG such as waste minimisation and management, emissions, investment in people development and other areas saw industry-leading initiatives such as zero liquid discharge, zero waste to landfills and Self-Managed Teams. In 2020, we became the first pharma company in India and the third in Asia to join the Science-based Targets initiative (SBTi) for reducing our carbon footprint. We have been recognised by the S&P Corporate Sustainability Assessment, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, Frost & Sullivan TERI among others, and are the only Indian pharma company to be featured on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.

However, there is a lot more to be done and such recognitions only serve to make our commitment and resolve stronger. This year we refreshed our sustainability and ESG goals for the next decade, while making them central to our purpose and integral to our strategy. Propelled by bold targets in affordability and innovation, we aim to triple our existing reach to touch the lives of over 1.5 billion patients by 2030. Our goals in renewable energy, emissions, diversity and inclusion, and corporate governance are equally aggressive. With nearly 20 years of leadership in sustainability in Indian pharma, we see it as our responsibility to set the bar high and deliver on these ambitious targets. Details of our refreshed ESG goals for the coming decade are on page 17.

As we go further into FY'23, we would like to thank our colleagues around the world for their tireless efforts to bring to life our purpose of Good Health Can't Wait. We are also grateful to our customers, suppliers, partners, healthcare professionals and of course our shareholders for their support. We count on your partnership as we move to the next and the new .

Yours sincerely,

K SATISH REDDY Chairman

## LEADERSHIP INDICATORS

Consultation with the respective stakeholder groups is done by the relevant business and functional heads. Feedback from such consultations is shared with the Board during the quarterly Board meetings.

Effective engagement helps us connect stakeholder needs with organizational goals, creates the basis of an effective strategy development, and unlocks greater shared value for all stakeholders. We use multiple platforms to engage with a wide variety of stakeholders to understand their unique needs and concerns and chart out suitable strategies to address them. We also conducted a materiality assessment that involved an intensive stakeholder engagement round. Our internal and external stakeholders identified key material topics across ESG that are likely to impact Dr. Reddy's business, like product availability, responsible pricing and affordability, high-quality medicines, patient safety, anti-bribery and corruption. These topics have been considered in the list of Dr. Reddy's action areas and our sustainability framework.

## 7. Mechanisms to prevent adverse consequences to the complainant in discrimination and harassment cases

Dr. Reddy's policy on Ombudsperson also supports the Company values and "Speak Up" culture by taking proactive steps to ensure that employees who raise concerns in good faith are protected and supported in the workplace, as appropriate. To protect the interest of complainant, Dr. Reddy's follows a strict non-retaliation policy, where any retaliation against an employee who in good faith raises concerns or who assists in an investigation of suspected wrongdoing, is not tolerated. Non-retaliation policy is applicable to all employees (including, but not limited to, all current and past employees, contract workers, part-time or temporary workforce) and third parties of the Company. A concern of potential retaliation can be raised through multiple reporting channels that are available and promoted across the organisation. Disciplinary action may be initiated if an employee knowingly raises a false or misleading concern.

- 9. Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by your Company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes

We have waste management systems in place at all our facilities. Plastic waste is either co-processed or recycled based upon the type of waste generated. E-waste is sold to authorized vendors. 99% of our global hazardous waste is sent to cement industries and recyclers for co-processing and recycling. The remaining 1% of global hazardous waste is sent to landfill. Other non-hazardous waste such as glass, MS scrap, wood waste, boiler ash etc. is sent to recyclers, cement industries for co-processing or to brick manufacturers.

We reduce waste through technological interventions and ongoing initiatives including sustainable packaging, waste source segregation, process optimization etc. For example, we have replaced plastic boxes with paper boxes for commercialized products (Practin tablets), removed triple laminated films and LDPE bags from primary packaging (Ibandronate tablets).

South Africa, China, Brazil, Australia and some other markets.

The FY2022 brought with it a diverse set of headwinds. It began with the severe second wave of COVID-19 impacting us during the initial months of the year; then we witnessed increased pricing pressure in the US, Europe and certain emerging markets; this was followed by high commodity prices which burdened our profitability; and it ended with conflict between Russia and Ukraine - both countries where we have business presence.

We rose to all these challenges. We ensured minimal impact to operations due to COVID-19 related disruptions; we improved our profitability through maximum leverage of the business opportunities presented to us, while growing our base business; and we continued our efforts to provide COVID-19 medications across the world. We also ventured into a new business called Svaas Wellness, an integrated cashless digital health platform and acquired a Company in Germany that focuses on medical cannabis in our quest for exploring new avenues of long-term growth. We were able to grow our businesses across North America, Europe, India and several emerging economies. However, our PSAI business saw a decline over previous year.

We continued our efforts towards greater cost controls and increased productivity as we carried on investing in digitalization initiatives across our

businesses, manufacturing facilities and brand development activities in emerging economies including India, Russia and others. These helped us to become more efficient and improve our profits, while ensuring long term strategic growth.

## IMPROVEMENTS IN REVENUE AND EBITDA IN FY2022 WERE MAINLY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.

- 1. Continued growth momentum in the branded generics markets. Thanks to improved base business performance, sale of COVID-19 products as well as the launch of new products, we continued our growth momentum across the key branded generics markets of India, Russia and other emerging markets.
- 2. Sustained performance in the generics markets of US & Europe. We witnessed decent growth in the US and Europe - driven by base business and some meaningful new product launches. Equally, it needs stating that the growth was constrained by increased pricing pressure on some of our products.
- 3. Continuation of productivity improvement measures while investing for future. Our journey to curtail costs through higher productivity and waste reduction across our businesses and by creating a leaner and more efficient throughput structure continued this year as well. The initiatives

<!-- image -->

undertaken to drive cost efficiencies and productivity improvement across manufacturing, procurement and R&D expenditures played a significant part in improving the financial performance of the Company. While focusing on productivity, we made significant investments to build people and digital capabilities, brands and product pipeline - all with an eye to benefit future growth.

## 4. Divestment of non-core brands.

- To focus on our core business and growth brands, we divested some of our brands belonging to Proprietary Products as well as a few from India and Emerging Markets that formed part of our global generics segment.

Our profit, however, was impacted due to impairment charge taken on certain products under development and on one of our manufacturing plants, which will be discussed later.

## A SNAPSHOT OF PERFORMANCE

## GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

- · Revenue from GG in FY2022 was ' 179.2 billion, which was an increase of 16% compared to the previous year. This growth occurred across all markets, with strong performances witnessed in Russia, India and some other Emerging Markets.

## As on 31 March 2022, we had 90 US generic filings pending for approval

<!-- image -->

·

- Revenue from North America Generics (NAG) was ' 74.9 billion, with a growth of 6% versus FY2021. This growth was supported by the launch of 17 new products during the year. Of these, the major new launches were Icosapent Ethyl capsules, Vasopressin injection, Ertapenem injection and Valsartan tablets. It should be noted that while there was a healthy growth in sales volume of our existing products, this was offset by pricing pressures on some of our key products, such as Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual films, Ciprofloxacin Dexamethasone, Dimethyl Fumarate and Liposomal Doxorubicin.

In FY2022, Dr. Reddy's filed seven new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). As on 31 March 2022, we had 90 generic filings pending approval from the USFDA. These comprise 87 ANDAs and three New Drug Applications (NDAs) filed under the Section 505(b)(2) route of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Of the 87 ANDAs, 44 are Para IV applications and we believe that 24 of these have 'First to File' status.

- · Revenue from Europe was ' 16.6 billion, representing a growth of 8% compared to FY2021. This was primarily due to expansion of the base business across our European markets, new product launches, but was partially offset due to pricing pressures on some of our products.
- · Revenue from Emerging Markets was ' 45.7 billion, or a growth of 30% compared to FY2021. This was driven by an improvement in our base business performance, new product launches, sale of COVID related products and scaling up of business in some of our newer markets. We also divested a few of our non-core brands in Russia and CIS - which further aided revenue growth.
- - Revenue from Russia was ' 20.9 billion, representing a year-onyear growth of 32%. This was driven by improved base business performance, launch of new
- products during the year and divestment of some brands.
- - Revenue from other CIS countries and Romania was ' 8.3 billion, or an annual growth of 11%.
- - Revenue from Rest of the World (RoW) territories was ' 16.5 billion, or a year-on-year growth of 40%.
- · Revenue from India was ' 42.0 billion, which represented a growth of 26% over FY2021. This was primarily attributable to an increase in both sales volume and prices of our existing products, along with additional revenues from the launch of new products. The growth was also aided by divestment of a few non-core brands during the year. During FY2022, we launched 20 new brands in India, including the Sputnik-V vaccine for COVID-19.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

Revenues from PSAI stood at ' 30.7 billion , which represents a decline of 4% compared to FY2021. This was mainly on account of a decrease in sales volumes and prices of our existing products, partially offset by launches of new products. Growth was also affected by the normalization of inventories held with customers due to the stocking-up that occurred in FY2021. During the year, we filed 139 Drug Master Files (DMFs) worldwide, including ten in the US.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

- · Revenue from PP was ' 1.6 billion. This translated to a growth of 208% and was primarily due to the recognition of ' 1.1 billion from a license fee associated with the sale of our US and Canada territory rights for ELYXYB® (Celecoxib oral solution) 25 mg/ml, to BioDelivery Sciences International, Inc. during FY2022.

## GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL MARKET OUTLOOK 1

Over the last year, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted into a new phase with cyclical emergence of new variants disrupting the healthcare systems and markets across the world. Use of medicines was affected across relevant

therapy areas with varied timing and impact. Of late, however, with increased data and information, the industry is moving closer to pre-pandemic patterns. There are reasons to be optimistic with the way global health systems have adapted and responded to extraordinary situations with rapid development and widespread use of vaccines along with improved therapies.

Though estimates vary considerably, research now suggests that people may have long-term complications of the COVID-19 infection. Research is ongoing to develop therapies to address these symptoms where existing medicines are ineffective and, as the pandemic continues, the ultimate size of this affected population remains uncertain but seems to be growing.

With the periodic emergence of new viral variants, the global market may witness short term fluctuations. In the longer term, however, the impact is expected to be muted and the world's pharmaceutical market ought to return to pre-pandemic growth rates.

According to IQVIA's recent report on medicine usage, global medicine spending is forecasted to reach $1.8 trillion by 2026, increasing at a rate of 3% to 6% annually. Trends in medicine

use and spending have been impacted by the short term effects of COVID-19, with a cumulative reduction in spending of $175 billion expected through 2026 compared to the pre-pandemic outlook.

The largest driver of expenditure on medicine over the next five years is expected to be COVID-19 vaccinations which could generate more than $300 billion in spending - not only because of the increasing number of people being vaccinated and the speed with which this is expected to be achieved but also on account of repeated booster shots.

Global biosimilar drugs are expected to see a 61% aggregate increase over the next five years with a 9% to 12% CAGR through 2026. Combined with lower cost of generics, the impact of exclusivity losses will rise to $188 billion over the next five years, with a large part of it coming from biosimilars.

To counter this, global spending on medicines will be driven by investments in innovation, with launches of new medicines at an average of 54 to 64 new active substances per year. Specialty medicines will represent about 45% of global spending in 2026 and almost 60% of total spending in developed markets.

Table 1 shows the five-year CAGR of the top 20 therapy areas in terms of global spending.

The two leading global therapy areas - oncology and immunology - are forecasted to grow by 9% to 12% and 6% to 9% CAGR, respectively, up to 2026, lifted by significant increases in new treatments and medicine use. Oncology spending is expected to increase by 63% over the next five years and is projected to add 100 new treatments in this period.

## REGION WISE OUTLOOK:

- · US: The US market is forecasted to grow at 0% to 3% CAGR over the next five years, down from 3.5% in the past five years. The reduction is largely on account of patent expiries and new generic and biosimilar competition. In this period, more than 250 new active substances (NAS) are expected to be launched in the US; and, in the aggregate, new products are expected to contribute $114 billion in spending.
- · Europe: Spending on medicine in European markets is expected to increase significantly due to investments in innovation. This will be offset by loss of exclusivity in the top European countries - which is expected to triple over the next five years, with more than half of this impact due to biosimilars.
- · China: China's growth remains the largest driver of the pharmerging markets growth and its spending is expected to increase at 2.5% to 5.5% CAGR up to 2026. Since 2017, the National Reimbursement Drug List (NDRL) has been updated annually. This has enabled companies in getting quicker reimbursements which, in turn, has led to new drugs reaching patients sooner than before. Pharmaceutical spending growth in China is expected to accelerate post-COVID, driven almost entirely by new original medicines.

Global biosimilar drugs are expected to see a 61% aggregate increase over the next five years with a 9% to 12% CAGR through 2026.

- · India: The Indian pharma industry has grown 10 times in the last two decades driven by its strength in the global generics space. It now supplies around 40% of generics in the US and caters to over 60% of the global vaccine demand. Going forward, it is tipped to be one of the fastest growing markets, with an expected CAGR of around 11%. To move up the value chain beyond the generics, India has multiple opportunities in specialty pharma, biosimilars and novel biological drugs, vaccines and preventives and other areas of unmet needs. There is a huge potential for the country to establish as the global innovation hub of the future.
- · Russia: Russia has prepared a new strategy for the pharmaceutical sector for 2030, with more focus on the development of biological and pathogenetic drugs. This road map should also create conditions for more active production within the country. Prior to the conflict with Ukraine, Russian market was expected to show strong growth with a CAGR of around 11.4%. With numerous countries imposing sanctions on Russia, it is now unclear as to how the pharmaceutical industry will perform in the near future.

Similar to last couple of annual reports, we believe that some major changes will persist in the industry over the next few years. With access to a large number of analytical, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning tools to gather and analyse data, we believe it is time for pharma companies to employ digitalization at a much greater scale and move beyond the conventional models to solve future challenges and reap more rapid benefits.

Some key trends that are likely to emerge over the next few years are given below.

- · Digital Manufacturing: Pharma executives are looking at Industry 4.0 manufacturing techniques as solutions to rising complexity and costs in manufacturing. Smart autonomous factories managed with data and machine learning should lower pharma manufacturing costs, improve quality and reduce capacity constraints. Smart connected factories are expected to yield savings of 20% or more, while improving quality and making deliveries more reliable. The emergence of personalized medicine with drugs tailored to individual patients also means more complex processes - solutions to which are expected to be provided through various smart manufacturing processes.
- · Developing Digital/Decentralised Clinical Trials: COVID-19 has accelerated the decentralization and digitalization of clinical trials. First-mover pharmaceutical companies will use digital tools to accelerate speed to market. Various reports suggest that 70% of the contract research organizations (CROs) found that their trials were disrupted by COVID-19; and 32% of trials went virtual during the pandemic. We predict significant growth in data-enabled trial designs in the near future - as these would tend to strongly increase a drug's likelihood of success, cause fewer delays and protocol amendments and, hence, increase speed to market.
- · Healthcare M&A: Record-High Valuations: Strategic healthcare M&A rebounded in 2021 from the pandemic-ravaged 2020. What is different this time, though, is that the cost of acquisitions has become dramatically more expensive in most areas, with deal multiples reaching the highest level in decades. The median healthcare deal fetched 20 times forward-looking enterprise value (EV)/ EBITDA in 2021 - which was five times higher than in 2019, the last time that M&A volumes were as high.
- · Scaling Digital for End-to-End Transformation: As companies push digital across the value chain, we are seeing this transformation being tackled head on by executive leaderships at the senior-most levels. There has been a conscious shift from
- 'doing digital', i.e., applying digital capabilities in an ad hoc manner, to 'being digital' - which is incorporating a differentiating digital strategy and incorporating it into the organisation's DNA.
- · Pandemic-led Reinvention of Healthcare Delivery: As healthcare is getting personal, demand for teleconsultations with continuous monitoring has soared - with 38x higher demand than before the pandemic. Such a huge increase has led to higher investments in this space which will push companies to innovate and find newer models to enhance virtual healthcare delivery.
- · Pharmacovigilance Market to Scale Up: Increase in digital central trials and accelerated speed to market of medicines and vaccines amplify the need for better drug quality and prevention of adverse side effects. Pharmacovigilance's ultimate goal is to optimize the benefit-risk ratio of healthcare products usage by sharing accurate information with patients and healthcare professionals. It is anticipated that the global pharmacovigilance market will grow at a CAGR of 13% till 2028.
- · Surge in Prescriptions for Medical Marijuana: The perception of marijuana as a medicine is changing. Healthcare professionals have pointed out the benefits that have become evident when using medical marijuana for pain reduction, mood regulation, digestive functions and vascular health, among other conditions. Studies have shown that this is an effective method for the treatment of chronic pain and is safer than many alternate options. Its market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18%, with North America holding the largest share of global market.
- · Strategic Partnerships and Digital Transformation for a Resilient Supply Chain: Developments post the COVID-19 pandemic, and more recently during the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have amplified the need for pharma companies to have multiple sources of supply spread across different geographies. This will enable companies to quickly switch production from highly affected to lesser impacted territories. Pharmaceutical manufacturers are

working with API manufacturers to brainstorm ways to increase output and make sure they are getting medicines exactly where it was needed to avoid stockouts. Some of the key emerging trends in the industry are:

- (i) Smart manufacturing with automation of the packaging process.
- (ii) Blockchain technology to detect low standard medicines and processes at every step from production to distribution of drugs and end to end traceability in the suppy chain

## · Pharmacogenomics:

- Pharmacogenomics, i.e., to develop effective medications that can be prescribed based on a person's genetic makeup, is one of the major emerging trends in the field of medical science and is greatly influencing the drug development process. As the industry moves towards a patient-centric care model with focus

<!-- image -->

- on precision medicines, we could see a surge in pharmacogenomics.
- · Reimagining Work Experience with New Operating Models: With the 'Great Resignation' impacting almost all the industries, employers are looking at ways to create a more meaningful work experience. Given an increasing volume of distributed remote work, organisations are revaluating their network costs and operating models. Many older workers are choosing early retirement and more than 40% of global workforce is looking for new jobs. By 2025, it is estimated that 40% of core skills will change for workers. Going forward, life sciences industry will not only be competing from within but also outside the industry for the same digital and data talent.
- · Increased Adoption of ESG: ESG is expected to remain at the forefront as companies face enhanced disclosures and new global standards requirements. Especially post-Covid, the industry in general has focused its attention on developing and strengthening its ESG initiatives to bolster societal impact and changes in terms of long term sustainable growth.

Our growth has been on account of an improved base business performance both in terms of sales volumes and prices as well as revenues from launch of new products during the year. Growth was also aided by revenue from divestment of a few non-core brands.

During the year, we launched 20 brands in India, including Sputnik-V (COVID-19 vaccine), 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) and Vicra. As per IQVIA, fifteen of our brands - Omez, Omez-D, BroZedex, Atarax, Zedex, Practin, Razo-D, Econorm, Ketorol, Doxt-SL, Nise, Stamlo, Mintop, Tryptomer and Voveran - are among the top 300 brands of the Indian pharmaceuticals market.

In the near term, we will continue to drive productivity improvement and focus on our core therapeutic areas and big brands. In the medium to long-term, our strategy is to build a healthy pipeline of differentiated products in relevant therapies including biosimilars and expand our presence in areas such as nutraceuticals.

billion

Revenue from India for FY2022

## PSAI

The PSAI business recorded revenue of ' 30.7 billion in FY2022, which was a decline of 4% as compared to the previous year. In FY2022 we filed 139 drug master files (DMFs) globally, of which 10 were in the US.

The PSAI segment primarily consists of our business of manufacturing and marketing active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as APIs, which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. APIs become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. We also serve our customers with incremental value-added products including semi-finished and finished formulations. This segment also includes our contract research services business and our manufacture and sale of APIs and steroids in accordance with specific customer requirements.

Our strategy of building a sustainable and growing business involves new product launches and ramping up of base businesses in key geographies. We will also leverage our relationships with key customers by supplying materials that have value addition instead being 'plain-vanilla' APIs. We aim to be a

partner of choice for international pharmaceutical companies and achieve leadership through costs and service.

(a) INR to USD exchange rate for FY2022 is INR 75.87 = USD 1. For the sake of comparability and to eliminate gains/losses purely on account of exchange rate fluctuations between the two reported years, we use the INR to USD exchange for FY2022 also for FY2021.

## REVENUE

Total revenue grew by 13% to ' 214,391 million in FY2022. Growth was primarily aided by increase in volume and new product launches across our businesses including sale of COVID-19 products, but partially offset by price erosion in North America (the US and Canada), Europe and a few Emerging Markets. Growth was also on account of revenues from divestment of a few of our noncore brands in Russia and India and recognition of a license fee in our Proprietary Products segment during the year.

<!-- image -->

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profit increased by 10% to ' 113,840 million in FY2022. The gross profit margin was 53.1% in FY2022 - representing a decrease of 120 basis points compared to FY2021. The gross profit margin for GG was 57.6%. The GG gross profit margin was largely impacted due to price erosion in the US, Europe and certain emerging markets and reduction in export benefits, partially offset by benefits from the cost optimization initiatives taken by the Company and a favorable product mix. For the PSAI business, the gross profit margin was 22.2%. PSAI's gross profit margin decreased primarily on account of price erosion for some of our products and reduction in export benefits.

## SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A)

SG&A expenses rose by 14% to ' 62,081 million in FY2022. This was largely due to increase in personnel costs primarily on account of increased head count and annual increments; higher investments towards brand building and marketing activities; increase in royalty fees; and growth in legal and professional expenses. The increase was also attributable to the normalization of travel and other expenses which were lower last year due to COVID-19. SG&A accounted for 29.0% of sales in FY2022, which was in line with that of last year.

## R&D EXPENSES

R&D expenses for FY2022 were ' 17,482 million, or 8.2% of revenue, versus 8.7% in FY2021. The R&D spends in FY2022 increased by 6% over the previous year due to an increase in the development activities relating to our biosimilars and drug discovery businesses.

Gross profit increased by 10% to E 113,840 million, translating to a gross profit margin of 53.1% for FY2022.

## IMPAIRMENT OF NON-CURRENT ASSETS

In FY2022, there has been an impairment charge of ' 7,562 million which pertains to:

- a) ' 4,337 million for the product Tepilamide Fumarate Extended Release Tablets (PPC-06), forming part of the Company's Proprietary Products segment. During the year, there has been a significant decrease in market potential as a result of adverse market conditions for this product.
- b) ' 3,051 million for the assets and goodwill forming part of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary - Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Louisiana LLC, USA (Shreveport). During FY2022, this entity witnessed a significant decline in cash flows of products due to increased competition leading to lower volumes.
- c) ' 174 million on other product intangibles and goodwill pertaining to some products belonging to the

global generics segment, where the Company determined that there was a decrease in market potential.

## NET OTHER INCOME

Net other income was ' 2,761 million in FY2022 versus ' 982 million in FY2021. This income was higher primarily on account of recognition of an income of ' 1,064 million towards sale of all of our rights relating to our anti-cancer agent E7777 (Denileukin Diftitox) to Citius Pharmaceuticals, Inc. during FY2022.

## NET FINANCE INCOME

Net finance income was ' 2,119 million in FY2022 versus ' 1,653 million in FY2021.

## NET PROFIT

Net profit increased by 37% to ' 23,568 million in FY2022. This represents a PAT margin of 11.0% of revenues versus 9.1% in FY2021. In FY2022, the effective tax rate was lower as compared to FY2021 largely on account of a rise in the proportion of our profits from lower tax jurisdictions and due to an increase in

income from sale of capital assets, which is taxable at a lower rate.

## LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The data is given in Tables 4 and 5. Cash generated from operating activities in FY2022 was ' 28,108 million. Investing activities comprised a net outflow amounting to ' 26,387 million in FY2022, which included net investment in property, plant, equipment and intangibles to build capacity and capabilities for future business growth. Cash outflow from financing activities was ' 2,422 million. Closing cash and cash equivalents as on March 31, 2022 was ' 14,852 million.

## DEBT-EQUITY

In FY2022, total borrowings, including the current and non-current portion, increased by ' 3,546 million compared to FY2021. As on 31 March 2022 the Company's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.16 which is same as that on 31 March 2021. The net debt-to-equity position was at (0.08) versus (0.04) last year. Table 6 gives the data.

## ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

Our ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- · proactively identify and highlight risks to relevant stakeholders;
- · facilitate discussions around risk prioritization and mitigation;
- · provide a framework to assess appetite;
- · develop systems to warn when the appetite is being breached; and
- · provide an analysis of residual risk.

The ERM team connects with our business units and functions, which are the primary sources for risk identification. It also monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers in the industry. The team collaborates with quality assurance, compliance, internal audit, information security, safety, HR and other assurance teams to identify and mitigate risks of business units, including risk relating to cyber security and environment.

Our ERM function focuses on identification of key business, operational and strategic risks. These are carried out through quarterly assurance

meeting, structured interviews, on-call discussions and review of incidents.

Risks are aggregated at the unit, function and organization levels and are categorized by risk groups. Our response framework categorizes these risks into (i) internal (preventable), (ii) internal (strategic) and (iii) external risks. The executive risk management Committee is a management level Committee that helps the ERM function to prioritize organization-wide risks and steer mitigation efforts in line with our risk appetite.

Mitigation work carried out by the ERM team is regularly reviewed and progress of key risks is discussed with the executive risk management committee, senior management, as well as at the risk management Committee of the Board of directors. These include (i) updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks and (ii) specific risk-related initiatives carried out during the year.

During FY2022, risk mitigation efforts included review of risks and mitigations related to cyber security, quality, talent and capability, compliance and ethics program across the company, supply chain and other operating risk exposures and risk transfer through insurance.

## HUMAN RESOURCES (HR)

In FY2022, safety protocols were strengthened across locations to ensure seamless return to work from offices. This was supported by focused attention on well-being interventions like webinars on mental wellness by certified psychologists, wellness workshops covering meditation, yoga and pranayama by experts and nutritionist consultations for employees and families who were impacted with COVID-19.

We also launched a seven-month comprehensive program to support holistic well-being, focusing on the four pillars of well-being: Physical, Psychological, Relational and Spiritual. Vaccination drives were conducted for all employees and their families across various Indian cities.

To support the families of employees we lost to the pandemic, a series of benevolent measures were announced, such as extension of fixed salaries, medical insurance coverage for two years and education support for two children up to their graduation.

Post the COVID-19 outbreak, the focus has been on strengthening our people processes and practices to support the new ways of working and employee needs. The value proposition is to ensure a connected, joyful and efficient experience across all touch-points of the employee lifecycle. Several initiatives were taken in this space. We used digitization as a tool to simplify processes and move towards a more do-it-yourself approach. Analytics is being leveraged to make data more real time through dashboards. Insights from Heartbeat (our in-house real-time employee pulse survey) are now available for managers to view their team's feedback.

The organization continues to experiment with hybrid ways of working for select cohorts. Satellite offices were

launched for employees in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore to enable work from different locations without compromising on business needs.

Spearheading the capability building agenda in the organization, specific programs were launched to support the strategic moves of the organization. Personalized learning journeys were initiated to enable individuals bridge specific skill gaps. To embed the culture of learning within Dr. Reddy's, we revamped the content to meet new requirements and modernized method of delivery, leveraging our learning platform. Podcasts and playbooks were launched to further strengthen the understanding of ASPIRE culture across the organization.

People Development Week was conducted in November 2021, that had over 150 speakers delivering more than 125 sessions across the organization which garnered over 24,000 views. Digital Ninja - our flagship digital capability building program launched earlier - had over 16,500 course completions; we now have more than 600 digital Ninjas across the organization. Additionally, the Digital

Transformation Programme was kickstarted for 100 leaders across 16 teams.

We introduced Kaizen Optimizer as a digital tool for implementation of Dr. Reddy's way of excellence and towards making the Strategy Development Plan (SDP) and Lean Daily Management (LDM) a part of our core culture. 90% of action plan owners across businesses completed trainings created to drive the adoption of SDP.

Continuing to focus on building a strong cadre, we conducted rigorous assessments for the senior and middle management. This was followed by cross-functional key talent interactions with leaders, cross-BU projects, peer interactions and stretch assignments to position key-talent for 'destination roles'. To ensure that roles critical to delivery of the business are deployed with effective talent, the Talent to Value process, earlier launched in India, was further extended to North America and Emerging Markets. To strengthen avenues of internal talent mobility, learning experiences were provided to employees via short term projects called Internal Gigs.

A two-week rural stint has been included in our flagship Young Leaders Program to develop socially conscious leaders.

<!-- image -->

45 young leaders had their stints in rural NCR, Wardha and Vizianagaram, in collaboration with the frontline teams of NICE Foundation & Naandi. We further strengthened our volunteering efforts this year by increasing opportunities for our employees to volunteer virtually via the 'Goodera' platform launched last year. 225 employees participated in 20 online events and volunteering weeks conducted in FY2022. We strengthened organization level support mechanisms to enable volunteering by launching a two-day volunteering leave policy for employees.

Diversity and inclusion continue to remain important in the organizational agenda in alignment with our ESG goals. Chrysalis, our flagship program for women in middle management, has now been extended globally, with a second batch of 27 women leaders completing the program. Nearly 20% of women participants from the previous batch of Chrysalis 1.0 have had role changes after completing the program.

Sensitization sessions on gender awareness and respect at work and needs of differently-abled were conducted for leadership teams, plant employees and other cohorts across geographies. We continue to sensitize employees towards women coming back after maternity. Awareness about the PRIDE month was created through our quarterly newsletter 'Rainbow Beats', highlighting stories of courage, achievement and professionalism displayed by our employees.

We have continued to strengthen our pipeline of diverse candidates through various tools and mechanisms, like focused employee referral programs to invite referrals for people who identify as women, differently-abled and LGBTQi and through extension of partnerships with women only institutes in India.

We kept a close eye on attrition across the year to manage the 'Great Resignation' that was witnessed by many industries. With a proactive approach, we were able to retain critical talent to ensure business continuity and support our growth agenda. We continue to address needs of our key talent by strengthening talent mobility, providing role enhancements, extending fle xible work, undertaking relevant

STATUTORY REPORTS

## TRANSFORM WITH DIGITAL:

As part of this theme, we run programs across the value chain that leverage digital and analytics to create top-line and bottom-line impact to the organization. The primary lever here is to use advanced analytics on top of the data lakes we have created across the organization.

In R&D, several digital science programs were implemented encompassing different data analytics initiatives using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and other technologies to do 'in-silico' experiments, to generate more informed decisions and, thus, improve the probability of success. We are seeing results in reduction of product development cycle time, cost savings in development and 'First Time Right' development.

In manufacturing, we brought together the best of digital and advanced analytics use cases in our largest formulation plant to create a 'Digital Lighthouse'. This has resulted in yield improvement, product robustness, reduction in product quality issues, optimization of production scheduling and, consequentially, reduced cost of poor quality (CoPQ) and per pack costs. Going forward, this program will be taken to other manufacturing plants.

We scaled up our digital efforts to provide better service to doctors using engagement platforms that provide all relevant information at a single place. We are also using omni-channel means to cover more doctors with the most relevant and personalized content. We have enabled our sales representatives in the field with advanced analytics-based algorithms for better efficiency along with relevant and personalized engagement with each doctor.

For our API business, we have now created a single place for entire customer lifecycle from inquiry to order to cash, providing end-to-end visibility with a single click resolution of all queries.

For our North America business, we have launched Key Account Management, Bid Management and Product Management platforms to create 360-degree view of the customer-product combination enabling us to help our customers with the right service levels.

compensation measures, increasing talent connects with leadership across organization and having regular interactions with employees to identify and cater to their concerns.

## DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

We continued to make progress in our digital transformation journey taking significant leaps in FY2022. This journey is broadly driven by the twin themes of driving productivity and improving our customer value proposition. We have classified this journey into two themes as outlined below.

## DIGITALIZE THE CORE:

Our objective under this theme is to simplify and digitalize our processes that would enable us to create scale without adding complexity. We completed transforming our core processes on SAP S/4 HANA this year. We continued our journey on paperless shopfloor and labs by extension of digital solutions such as Manufacturing Execution System (MES), Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) and the Electronic Lab Notebook across the organization. We are on track to take our overall digitalization of processes to over 90% in the near future.

We are also integrating cross-functional processes across the value chain by implementing and adopting platforms such as:

- · Selection to Commercialization: This will place the entire lifecycle from product selection, development, planned scale-up to commercialization under a single platform.
- · Integrated Business Planning: This will take our sales and operations planning (S&OP) process to next level of maturity, link our strategic planning process with long term capacity plans and also integrate revenue and supply chain planning.
- · Product Management System:This will drive analytics-led decisions around product lifecycle management.
- · Employee Lifecycle Management:This platform will provide an integrated employee experience throughout the lifecycle.

Cross-functional platforms are enabling end-to-end process visibility, strong analytics-led decision making, learning engines to create organizational memory and, as needed, the ability to integrate external partners with our value chain.

We are simplifying and digitalizing our processes that would enable us to create scale without adding complexity.

Continuing our journey to help patients in their entire journey, we scaled up our cancer management platform in two countries.

Svaas Wellness (an integrated cashless digital health platform) was launched this year. We expect this to help our patients in out-patient insurance by servicing them through an ecosystem of partners.

## OUTLOOK

FY2022 was a year where we faced several headwinds - continued COVID-19 waves with different variants in several of our major markets, increase in commodity prices, relatively high attrition in line with the trend of 'The Great Resignation' witnessed across the world and the increase in geopolitical tensions with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. This led to several challenges in operations, supply chain, logistics and cost structures.

However, we rose to the occasion and mitigated these headwinds with several proactive measures and learnings from the previous year. Our operations continued throughout the year and we ensured that supplies were available for each of our markets. Business continuity measures were undertaken while

ensuring the health and safety of our employees and business partners.

During the year, we also launched several products for COVID-19 including the Sputnik-V vaccine to cater to the specialized needs of patients.

The pricing environment in the US and Europe became increasingly challenging in FY2022 which led to significant price erosion; and delays in some of the key new product launches in these markets impacted growth. However, the strong performance in branded markets, led by improvement in the base business helped us grow reasonably.

Our commitment towards quality is reflected in all our facilities being fully compliant with the respective regulatory agencies' requirements.

Our journey towards improving our market share position across different markets and continued focus towards creating a leaner business model, leveraging productivity improvement, cost control and increased efficiencies across several functions continued in FY2022.

While we focused on productivity measures, we, simultaneously, continued investing in current and

While we focused on productivity measures, we, simultaneously, continued investing in current and future businesses

future businesses to make these more competitive and future ready. We did this through investments in digitalization, marketing of brands and development of our portfolio of complex products and biosimilars. We also forayed into digital healthcare with the launch of Svaas Wellness, a multi-service platform combining doctors, laboratories and diagnostics, pharmacies and out-patient insurance, all under one roof. These investments will continue in FY2023 and provide necessary impetus to our performance in the coming years.

We remain focused on patient-centric product innovation, operational excellence, continuous improvement and attaining leadership in chosen spaces. We are committed to look out for opportunities aligned with our future business strategies for inorganic growth. This is reflected in the acquisition of Nimbus Health and other deals during FY2022, while also divesting brands which do not form part of our future growth strategy. We will seek more such opportunities in future.

In spite of the headwinds being faced by us and industry as a whole, we remain cautiously optimistic of overcoming these and thereby improving our business

performance while creating levers for long term growth. These should also guide us to deliver a better performance in the year ahead.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

Based upon recommendations of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee (NGCC), the Board considers the appointment and reappointment of Directors.

Section 149(10) of the Act, provides that an Independent Director shall hold office up to five consecutive years on the Board of a Company from the date of appointment and shall be eligible for reappointment for a second term of up to five consecutive years on passing of a special resolution by the members. Moreover, Independent Directors cannot retire by rotation.

During FY2022, the members of the Company approved the appointment of Dr. K P Krishnan (DIN: 01099097) and Ms. Penny Wan (DIN: 09479493) as Independent Directors in terms of Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013 and applicable provisions of the Listing Regulations, through Postal Ballot, with effect from January 7, 2022 and January 28, 2022, respectively.

Section 152 of the Act, states that onethird of the Board members, other than Independent Directors, who are subject to retire by rotation, shall retire every year and be eligible for reappointment, if approved by the members. Accordingly, Mr. K Satish Reddy (DIN: 00129701) retires by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM) and being eligible, seeks reappointment.

Additionally, the Board of Directors at its meeting held on May 19, 2022 reappointed Mr. K Satish Reddy (DIN: 00129701), as a Whole-time Director, designated as Chairman of the Company (or such other designation as the Board may deem fit), for a further period of five years with effect from October 1, 2022, subject to approval of the members at the forthcoming 38$^{th}$ AGM Scheduled to be held on July 29, 2022.

Therefore, at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, approval of members is being sought for reappointment of Mr. K Satish Reddy, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, offers himself for

reappointment, as Whole-time Director designated as Chairman of the Company for a further period of five years with effect from October 1, 2022.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the Board is the responsibility of the NGCC of the Board, which consists entirely of Independent Directors. The existing composition of the Board, the tenure as well as the years left of the existing members to serve on the Board and the need for new domain expertise are reviewed by this Committee regularly. When such a need becomes apparent, the Committee reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings. It then places the details of shortlisted candidates to the Board for its consideration. If the Board approves, the person is appointed as an Additional Director, subject to the approval of members in the Company's next general meeting.

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new Independent Director with the Company, an information kit is provided containing documents about the Company. It contains, inter alia , information/ documents such as its Annual Reports, sustainability reports, investor presentations, recent press releases, research reports, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (COBE) a brief on Company's Board practices, Committee charters and a dossier on pharma primers and overview of Company's operations. The new Independent Director individually meets with Board members and senior management. Visits to plants and research locations are organized for the Director to understand the Company's operations.

We believe that the Board should be continuously empowered with knowledge of latest developments affecting the Company and the industry. Apart from regular presentations on the Company's business strategies and associated risks, expositions are made on various topics covering the pharmaceutical industry.

Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial pronouncements around industry related laws are regularly circulated to the Directors. They also visit the Company's manufacturing and research locations. Each Director has complete access to any of the Company's information and full freedom to interact with the senior management.

Details of the familiarization programs for Independent Directors are available on the Company's website: https://www. drreddys.com/cms/cms/sites/default /fil es/2022-06/Familiarization%20 programs%202022.pdf

## LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Upon their appointment, Independent Directors are given a formal appointment letter containing, inter alia , the terms of appointment, roles, functions, duties and responsibilities, the Company's code of conduct, disclosures and confidentiality. Such terms and conditions are available on the Company's website: https://www.drreddys.com/investor/ governance/#governance#policies-anddocuments

## BOARD EVALUATION

Pursuant to the provisions of the Act and Regulation 17(10) of the Listing Regulations, the Board has carried out the annual evaluation of its own performance, as well as the performance of the Audit Committee, Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, Stakeholders' Relationship Committee, Risk Management Committee and Science, Technology and Operations Committee. The performance evaluation of each Directors, including Chairman, was also undertaken by the Board. Generally, the performance evaluation process is being carried out either through engagement of an independent expert or internally.

During FY2022, the performance evaluation process was undertaken internally, based on the criteria formulated by the NGCC. Each Director completed a questionnaire involving peer evaluation and feedback on processes of the Board and its Committees. The contribution and impact of individual members were evaluated on a number of parameters, such as

level of engagement, independence of judgment, conflict resolution, contributions to enhance the Board's overall effectiveness, etc. Peer ratings on certain parameters, positive attributes and improvement areas for each Director were provided to them on a confidential basis. Furthermore, the Committees were evaluated on parameters such as effective discharge of their roles, responsibilities and advice given to the Board for discharging its fiduciary responsibilities, including adequate and periodical updates to the Board on the Committees' functioning. The details of the stated parameters are disclosed in the Board's Report.

The Independent Directors at their separate meetings also evaluated the performance of the Chairman, Co-Chairman and Managing Director and the Board, without the presence of the Executive Directors.

The Board periodically reviews the findings and recommendations of the statutory and internal auditors and suggests corrective actions, whenever necessary.

## INTERNAL CONTROLS

We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:

- · Organization's strategic objective;
- · Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
- · Adequacy of safeguards for assets;
- · Reliability of financial and non -fin ancial reporting; and
- · Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

The integrity and reliability of our internal control systems are achieved through clear policies and procedures, process automation, training and development of employees and an organization structure that segregates responsibilities.

Our internal audit team is an independent assurance and advisory function, responsible for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes. The internal audit team helps to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based objective assurance, advice and insight. The internal audit team prepares annual audit plans based on risk assessment and conducts extensive reviews covering financial, operational and compliance controls. Areas requiring specialized knowledge are reviewed in partnership with external experts or by recruiting resources with specialized

skills. Suggested improvements in processes are identified during reviews and communicated to the management on an ongoing basis.

The Audit Committee of the Board monitors the performance of the internal audit team on a periodic basis through review of audit plans, audit findings and speed of issue resolution through follow ups. Each year, there are at least four meetings in which the Audit Committee reviews internal audit findings. During the year, the Audit Committee Chairman also met the Chief Internal Auditor without the presence of management.

To the shareholders of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

The Audit Committee of the Board consists of four Directors. Each member is an Independent Director as defined under Indian laws, Listing Regulations and the New York Stock Exchange Corporate Governance Guidelines. The Committee operates under a written charter adopted by the Board of Directors and has been vested with all the powers necessary to effectively discharge its responsibilities.

- Dr. Reddy's management has primary responsibility for the financial statements and reporting process, including the systems of internal controls. During FY2022, the Audit Committee met five times. It discussed with the Company's internal auditors, statutory auditors and independent auditors the scope and plans for their respective audits. It also discussed the results of their examination, their evaluation of the Company's internal controls and overall quality of the Company's financial reporting. The Audit Committee provides at each of its meetings an opportunity for internal and external auditors to meet privately with the members of the Committee, without the presence of management.

In fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the Committee reviewed and discussed the Company's quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements with the management. M/s. S.R. Batliboi & Associates LLP, chartered accountants, the Company's statutory auditors for financial statements prepared in accordance with Ind AS and M/s. Ernst & Young Associates LLP, the Company's independent auditors for financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, are responsible for expressing their opinion on the conformity of the Company's financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), as applicable.

Relying on the review and discussions with the management and the auditors, the Audit Committee believes that the Company's financial statements are fairly presented in conformity with Indian accounting standards (Ind AS) and the IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board in all material aspects.

To ensure that the accounts of the Company are properly maintained and that accounting transactions are in accordance with the prevailing laws and regulations, the Committee reviewed the internal controls put in place by the Company. In conducting such reviews, the Committee found no material discrepancy or weakness in the Company's internal control systems.

During the year, the Committee, inter alia , also reviewed the following:

- a) Non-audit services being provided by the statutory and independent auditors and concluded that such services were not in conflict with their independence;
- b) Structure of the internal audit function, internal audit plan and Chief Internal Auditor's remuneration;
- c) Related party transactions, as applicable;
- d) The financial statements of the subsidiaries including their investments and significant transactions; and
- e) Ombudsperson process/complaints and insider trading matters.

The Committee ensures that the Company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics has a mechanism such that no personnel intending to make a complaint relating to securities and financial reporting shall be denied access to the Audit Committee.

The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors:

- a) That the audited standalone and consolidated financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited for the year ended March 31, 2022, prepared as per Ind AS be approved by the Board as a true and fair statement of the financial status of the Company; and
- a) That the financial statements prepared as per IFRS as issued by International Accounting Standards Board for the year ended March 31, 2022, be approved by the Board and be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F, to be filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

## TRANSFER OF UNDERLYING SHARES TO INVESTOR EDUCATION AND PROTECTION FUND (IEPF)

Pursuant to Section 124(6) of the Act, read with Investor Education and Protection Fund Authority (Accounting,

Audit, Transfer and Refund) Rules, 2016, as amended, all shares in respect of which dividend has not been paid or claimed for seven consecutive years or more, shall be transferred to IEPF.

During the year, the Company has transferred (transmission) 4,980 equity shares held under 102 folios to IEPF, on which dividend has not been paid or claimed for seven consecutive years.

shareholders can receive dividend electronically by way of direct credit to their bank account. With this service, problems such as loss of dividend warrants during postal transit/fraudulent encashment are avoided. This also expedites credit of dividend directly to the shareholder's bank account as compared to the payment through physical dividend warrant. Shareholders are advised to refer to the Investor Handbook on the Company's website, www.drreddys.com , for further details on this facility.

## UNCLAIMED DIVIDENDS

Pursuant to Section 125 of the Act, unclaimed dividend amounts for the FY2014 of ' 86,22,144/- and has been transferred to the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) of the Government.

The dividend amounts for the FY2015 which have been unclaimed for seven years will be transferred to IEPF. Shareholders who have not claimed the dividend(s) amount are, therefore, requested to do so before they are statutorily transferred to the IEPF. Table 11 gives the transfer dates in this regard.

The shareholders who have not encashed their dividend are requested to immediately approach Company's RTA, for making payment through electronic bank transfer. In cases, where bank details for making electronic payment are not available, or electronic payment instructions have failed or rejected by the bank, duplicate warrant(s)/demand draft(s) may be issued in lieu of the original warrant(s)/demand draft(s).

The information on unclaimed dividend is available on the Company's website: www.drreddys.com .

The Company has sent individual notices to the latest available addresses of the shareholders, whose dividends are lying unpaid/unclaimed for FY2015 along with subsequent seven consecutive years' dividend, advising them to claim the dividends on or before August 30, 2022. The Company has also published a notice in newspapers inviting the shareholders' attention to this matter, in May, 2022.

Shareholders who have not claimed their dividends since FY 2014-15 can write to the Company's RTA or at the registered office of the Company on or before August 30, 2022, for making a valid claim for the unclaimed dividends. If the shareholders do not claim the unpaid or unclaimed dividends and provide

the requisite documents on or before August 30, 2022, the shares held by them are liable to be transferred to IEPF.

Any person, whose shares and unpaid/ unclaimed dividends get transferred to the IEPF may claim the shares and unpaid/unclaimed dividends from the IEPF Authority in accordance with the prescribed procedure and submission of relevant documents procedure.

Details of equity shares liable to be transferred to IEPF are available on the Company's website: www.drreddys.com

## DEALING WITH SECURITIES WHICH HAVE REMAINED UNCLAIMED

Pursuant to Regulation 39(4) of Listing Regulations read with Schedule VI of

the said Regulations, the Company has dematerialized shares which have been returned undelivered by postal authorities and shares lying unclaimed after sub-division. The dematerialized shares are held in an 'unclaimed suspense account' opened with a depositary participant associated with NSDL.

Any corporate benefits accruing on such shares, viz. bonus shares, split etc., shall also be credited to an unclaimed suspense account, for a period of seven years and thereafter shall be transferred by the Company to IEPF, in accordance with provisions of Section 124(5) and (6) of the Act and Rules made thereunder.

Our executive compensation program supports attracting, motivating, and encouraging continuity of experienced and well-qualified executive officers who advance our critical business objectives and promote the creation of shareholders' value over the long-term. The key tenets of our philosophy are designed to:

- a) Attract highly talented individuals from within and across industries drawing from a diverse pool of global talent.
- b) Provide long term and short-term incentives that advance the interests of shareholders and deliver levels of pay commensurate with performance.

The three principal components of the compensation package include, base salary, annual cash-based variable pay, and equity-based long-term incentives. In making decisions with respect to each element of compensation, the competitive market for executives and compensation levels provided by comparable companies are considered.

Executive compensation is reviewed annually. In general executive increment, percentages are lesser than the average with the frontline receiving the highest increase. A higher increase may be made in the event of a role change, promotion, or in exceptional circumstances.

## ANNEXURE-VI

## CONSERVATION OF ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION, FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS AND OUTGO

## (A) CONSERVATION OF ENERGY:

During the year, the Company has implemented energy conservation projects across its various business units and accrued savings of approximately ' 267 million against an investment of ' 343 million.

With the above energy saving projects implementation, we have reduced 43,808 tons of CO$\_{2}$ emissions during the year.

Additional ' 436 million is being spent for the energy conservation and emission reduction projects including digital energy management system in FTO 11, FTO PU 1 and FTO 3 plants, Co-generation plant fuel conversion from fossil fuel to bio mass fuel in FY2023.

Major categories of energy projects are:

## 1. Installation of Innovative technology:

Implemented Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) for HVAC systems for continuous monitoring and automatic control on real time basis, based on demand /load and climate changes to reduce 20% to 25% power consumption across all FTOs. Replacement of conventional plug type or belt driven blowers with electronically commutated axial flow FLP motors with blower assembly to achieve 25% to 30% of power consumption reduction in

## (B) TECHNOLOGY ABSORPTION

- i. Efforts made towards technology absorption
- ii. Benefits derived like product improvement, cost reduction, product development or import substitution

AHUs across CTO-1, CTO-6, CTOSEZ plants. Horizontal deployment of Electronically Commutated (EC) motor technology in HVAC systems across FTO sites. Replacement of the existing Aluminum/ GRP/ FRP fans with energy efficient E Glass Epoxy FRP fan assembly to achieve 20% to 33% of power consumption reduction in Cooling Towers. Installed 450 TR Magnetic levitated bearing chiller in place of traditional old chiller to reduce energy loss and improve heat transfer efficiency at FTO 3 plant. Replacement of twin lobe blowers with energy efficient blowers in sewerage treatment plants.

## 2. Optimization of designs and operational efficiencies:

Replacement of 7 numbers of screw air compressors having specific power consumption of 0.21KW/ CFM with a single centrifugal air compressor having specific power consumption of 0.148 KW/CFM at CTO 6 plant. Replacement of existing screw air compressors (2 x 450 CFM) with single screw air compressor (900 CFM) to reduce the power consumption at CTO-1 plant. Replacement of existing multiple operating pumps with single pump with right head and flow for optimizing the power consumption. Existing 650 TR chiller replaced with VFD fitted energy efficient chiller in FTO 8 to reduce the power consumption.

To reduce the power consumption, non-inverter AC units were replaced with DC inverter units. Steam condensate recovery improvement from 60% to 70%, to improve the boiler efficiency. Frigitech oil additives for HVAC chillers to increase heat transfer efficiency. Optimization of compressed air pressure, arresting the air leakages & reduction of the loading hours of air compressor units. Power consumption reduction by using heat pump instead of geyser for hot water generation. Moved from Furnace oil to Natural gas for steam generation in FTO-2, 3 & Biologics plants to reduce scope-1 emissions.

## 3. Identifying renewable power sources at low cost:

Roof top solar power plants of 2.4 MW got commissioned in FTO-8, FTO-11, FTO-12 and biologics plants. 3 MW hydel power supply started to CTO-6 plant. 13 MW solar power supply started to FTO-2, 0.8 MW solar power supply to FTO-11 and 2.2 MW solar power supply started to IPDO.

With above renewable power additions, the Company has reduced 29,650 tons of CO$\_{2}$ emissions during the year.

With the above renewable capacity additions, the total roof top capacity has become 5.6 MW, 51.5 MW third party PPA's and 15 MW through JVC.

The Company has a full-fledged R&D division continuously engaged in research on new products and process improvement on existing products as part of continuous improvement in and outside India. As a part of technology absorption and adoption, once technology is developed for a product, it is tested in a pilot plant and thereafter commercial production is performed. Innovation is embarked by an incremental approach towards cost, time, quality and complex product development by adopting cutting edge technology and our philosophy is to continuously upgrade the technology.

Successful development of complex generics products accomplished through innovation and science. Improved quality by adopting quality by design concept. Technology adoption yielded improvement in robustness and cost.

development respectively in the standalone fi nancial statements)

As at 31 March 2022, the Company has intangible

- assets, including intangible assets under development, of ' 20,551 million and goodwill of ' 853 million. The carrying value of these intangible assets are based on future cash flows and there is ·
- a risk that the assets may be impaired if cash flows are not in line with projections. ·
- Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to management's assessment of recoverable amount, being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell, involving signifi cant ·
- operating costs and profit margins; appropriate discount rate and terminal value growth rate; and probability of technical and regulatory success factors in applying discounted cash fl ow valuation methodology. As the assessment of recoverable ·
- judgment and are based on number of variables and estimates including projection of future sales, ·

## Key audit matters

Contingencies, including litigations and tax contingencies in the standalone fi nancial statements)

- The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case- tocase basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation. · ·
- ·

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the diffi culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the standalone fi nancial statements. · ·

·

Returns, discounts and other deductions in Revenue statements and note 2.13 of the standalone fi nancial statements)

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for sales returns and discounts etc. The estimates relating to these accruals are important given the significance of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter. · · · ·

- d) Current and non-current classifi cation

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classifi cation.

All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements .

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classifi ed as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

## f) Prior period

Prior period amounts have been reclassifi ed to conform to the current year classifi cation.

## 1.3 Signifi cant accounting policies:

## a) New Standards adopted by the Company

On 24 July 2020, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) has issued amendments to certain Ind AS as summarised below:

## Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8: Defi nition of Material

The amendments provided a new definition to the word material as follows:

'Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose fi nancial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.'

The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to infl uence decisions made by the primary users.

An information is considered to be obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar eff ect for primary users of financial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The amendments provided examples of circumstances that may result in information being obscured.

An entity should apply the amendments prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020.

The amendments to the definition of material had no impact on the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## Amendments to Ind AS 103: Defi nition of a Business

The amendments clarified the definition of a business for the purpose of identifying a business combination under Ind AS 103-" Business Combinations ". As per the revised defi nition, business is 'an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities'.

A related amendment has been made to the defi nition of 'output' as an element of business.

The amendments include an election to use a 'concentration The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair assets.

An entity is required to apply the amendments to business the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after the 1 April 2020 and to asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period.

This amendment had no impact on the fi nancial statements of the Company but may impact future periods should the Company enter into any business combinations.

## Amendments to Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform

The amendments to Ind AS 109 "Financial Instruments" benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is aff ected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.

The amendments to Ind AS 107 " Disclosures reliefs as per the amendments in Ind AS 109 are applied.

beginning on or after the 1 April 2020.

statements of the Company as it does not have any interest rate hedge relationships.

## Amendments Ind AS 116: concessions

lessors.

The amendments provide a practical expedient that lessees lessors as a direct consequence of COVID-19 pandemic, as lease modifi cations. However, to be eligible for this relief:

- · the revised consideration for the lease should be less before the change, the rent concession should be for

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

(for example, lease rents are reduced for a period upto 30 June 2021 and increased for periods thereafter); and

- · there should be no substantial modifi cation to the other terms and conditions of the lease.

Lessee should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020. In case a lessee has not yet approved the financial statements for issue before the issuance of the amendments, then the same may be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after the 1 April 2019.

The aforesaid amendments had no impact on the fi nancial statements of the Company.

## b) Foreign currency

## Functional and presentation currency

These financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates diff erent from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- · certain debt instruments classified as measured at FVTOCI;
- · certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value;

- · a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is eff ective; and
- · qualifying cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are eff ective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## c) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a fi nancial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

## Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the fi nancial asset. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any significant financing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115 " Revenue from Contracts with Customers ".

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

- · Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- · Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
- · Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
- · Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and

- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specifi ed dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

Interest income from these financial assets is included in fi nance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in statement of profit and loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the OCI. However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the statement of profit and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the statement of profi t and loss, even on sale of investment.

However, on sale the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture:

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an the investment is assessed and written down immediately subsidiaries and joint venture, the diff erence between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Upon first-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1 April 2015.

## Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fi nancial primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

- · expired; or
- · obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through"

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

arrangements and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other fi nancial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as fi nancial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as eff ective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains or losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of profit and loss.

However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as FVTPL.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the eff ective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the eff ective interest rate. The eff ective interest rate amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles Brazilian reals, South African rands ("ZAR"), Romanian new leus ("RON") and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classifi ed as fi nancial assets when the fair value is positive and as fi nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifi es its derivative fi nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classified to the statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately .

The Company also designates certain non-derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash fl ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments having original maturities of three months or less from the management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash fl ows.

## d) Business combinations and goodwill

acquisition method regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

input and a substantive process that together signifi cantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is comprised of:

- · fair values of the assets transferred;
- · liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
- · equity interests issued by the Company;
- · fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
- · fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values.

For each business combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifi able net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Contingent consideration classified as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Amounts classified as a fi nancial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of:

- · the consideration transferred;
- · the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and
- · the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity.

over the fair value of the net identifi able assets acquired.

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the Company re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

## e) Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

An item of property, plant and equipment and any signifi cant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Selling and other expense" in the statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefi ts embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

## The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                                 | Years    |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                   |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings      | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                      | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and equipment                         | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi  ce equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                    | 4 to 5   |

## f) Goodwill and other intangible assets

|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Other intangible assets                                                                      |                    |
| Research and development                                                                     |                    |

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortisation expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

## The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                 | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 15 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful lives or expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate and are treated as change in accounting estimate.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

## Derecognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are derecognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from their use. Losses arising on such derecognition are recorded in the statement of profit and loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of derecognition.

## g) Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognises a right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

- · fi xed payments (including in-substance fi xed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- · variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date
- · amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees
- · the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- · payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term refl ects the Company exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The Company's lease liabilities are included in borrowings.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to statement of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of the following:

- · the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- · received
- · any initial direct costs, and
- · restoration costs.

straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment comprise IT equipment and small items of offi ce furniture.

## h) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

work-in-progress and finished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

weighted average method.

and condition.

packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton process.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to reflect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## i) Impairment

## Non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefi nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

## j) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefi t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the statement of profit and loss in employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defi ned benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the statement of profi t and loss.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defi ned benefit obligation and plan assets are recognized in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefi ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## k) Share-based payments

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding increase recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and performance that meet the related service and performance conditions was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss.

## l) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash fl ows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the statement detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring Future operating costs are not provided.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss when the expected benefi ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the specific expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an infl ow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## m) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

## Profit share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confirmation of units sold and net sales or net profit computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

for the difference between the price at which the product Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with holding by the wholesalers/other customers.

## Shelf stock adjustments

competition or otherwise. These credits are customary in applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Refund Liability

recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where categories where established products exist and are sold At the time of recognising the refund liability the Company

goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## n) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling and other expenses.

## o) Other income and fi nance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash flows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash fl ows. Finance cost consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss using the effective interest method. The associated cash flows are classified as financing activities in the statement of cash fl ows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange diff erences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash fl ow hedges.

## p) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for fi nancial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

## Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary diff erences, except:

- · temporary diff erences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that aff ects neither accounting nor taxable profi t;
- · temporary diff erences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary diff erences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi t will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

- · When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that

is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profi t nor taxable profi t or loss;

- · In respect of deductible temporary diff erences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary diff erences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profi t will be available against which the temporary diff erences can be utilised

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in OCI or directly in equity, respectively.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and reflects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## q) Earnings per share

profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## r) Government grants and incentives

there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the reporting the related expense in the statement of profi t and loss.

recognised in the statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive respect of the exports made by the Company, and where collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## s) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## t) Rounding of amounts

statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-fi nancial measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specifi c to that asset or liability.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which suffi cient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

- · Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the Management, based on market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefi ts.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable profit margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

## h) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on signifi cant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS 103, "Fair Value Measurement" refers to as Level 3 inputs.

As at 31 March 2022, the Group has intangible assets, including intangible assets under development, of ' 27,011 million and goodwill of ' 5,473 million.

## Key audit matters





The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Group assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case-to-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the diffi culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the consolidated financial statements.

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for chargeback, rebates, sales returns and discounts, etc. The estimates relating to these accruals are important given the significance of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

## d) Current and non-current classifi cation

The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classifi cation. All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, " Presentation of Financial Statements ".

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or

<!-- image -->

- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classifi ed as non-current.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classifi ed as non-current.

The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.

## 1.3 Signifi cant accounting policies:

- a) New Standards adopted by the Company

On 24 July 2020, the Ministry of Corporate Aff airs (MCA) has issued amendments to certain Ind AS as summarised below:

## Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8: Defi nition of Material

The amendments provided a new definition to the word material as follows:

'Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose fi nancial statements make on the basis of those financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.'

The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the financial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary users.

An information is considered to be obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar eff ect for primary users of financial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The amendments provided examples of circumstances that may result in information being obscured.

An entity should apply the amendments prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020.

The amendments to the definition of material had no impact on the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## Amendments to Ind AS 103: Defi nition of a Business

The amendments clarified the definition of a business for the purpose of identifying a business combination under Ind AS 103 " Business Combinations ". As per the revised defi nition, business is 'an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities'.

A related amendment has been made to the defi nition of 'output' as an element of business.

The amendments include an election to use a 'concentration test'. This is a simplified assessment that would cause in an acquisition to qualify as an asset acquisition. The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets.

An entity is required to apply the amendments to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after the 1 April 2020 and to asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period.

This amendment had no impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Company but may impact future periods should the Company enter into any business combinations.

## Amendments to Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform

The amendments to Ind AS 109 " Financial Instruments " provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is affected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.

The amendments to Ind AS 107 " Financial Instruments: Disclosures " prescribe the disclosures which entities are required to make for hedging relationships to which the reliefs as per the amendments in Ind AS 109 are applied.

These amendments are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after the 1 April 2020.

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company as it does not have any interest rate hedge relationships.

## Amendments Ind AS 116: COVID-19 related rent concessions

Ind AS 116 has been amended to provide limited relief to lessees in respect of rent concessions arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. No relief has been allowed to the lessors.

The amendments provide a practical expedient that lessees may elect to not treat any rent concessions, provided by lessors as a direct consequence of COVID-19 pandemic, as lease modifi cations. However, to be eligible for this relief:

-  the revised consideration for the lease should be less than or equal to the lease consideration immediately before the change;
-  the rent concession should be for a period that does not extend beyond 30 June 2021 (for example, lease rents are reduced for a period upto 30 June 2021 and increased for periods thereafter); and
-  there should be no substantial modifi cation to the other terms and conditions of the lease.

Lessee should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020. In case a lessee has not yet approved the financial statements for issue before the issuance of the amendments, then the same may be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after the 1 April 2019.

The aforesaid amendments had no impact on the consolidated fi nancial statements of the Company.

## b) Basis of consolidation

## Subsidiaries

The consolidated financial statements comprise the fi nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at 31 March 2022. Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.

other events in similar circumstances. If a subsidiary of the Company uses accounting policies other than those appropriate adjustments are made to that subsidiary's fi nancial statements in preparing the consolidated fi nancial accounting policies.

## Joint arrangements (equity accounted investees)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the parties have joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic fi nancial and operating decisions. The considerations made in determining whether signifi cant influence or joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over the subsidiaries.

A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

With respect to joint operations, the Company recognises expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identified on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest ("NCI") holders have certain significant participating rights that provide for effective involvement in significant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated fi nancial have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. Furthermore, the fi nancial statements of the joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as of the Company.

<!-- image -->

## Consolidation procedure

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated fi nancial statements, intra-group transactions are consolidated using the following procedures:

Combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. For this purpose, income and expenses of the subsidiary are based on the amounts of the assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated financial statements at the acquisition date.

Offset (eliminate) the carrying amount of the parent's investment in each subsidiary and the parent's portion of equity of each subsidiary.

Eliminate in full intragroup assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactions between entities of the group (profits or losses resulting from intragroup transactions that are recognised in assets, such as inventory and fixed assets, are eliminated in full). Intragroup losses may indicate an impairment that requires recognition in the consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Changes in ownership interests

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the difference arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash flows are classified as financing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## Loss of Control

-  derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost
-  derecognises the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interests
-  derecognises the cumulative translation diff erences recorded in equity
-  recognises the fair value of the consideration received
-  recognises the fair value of any investment retained
-  recognises any surplus or defi cit in profi t or loss
-  recognise that distribution of shares of subsidiary to Group in Group's capacity as owners
-  reclassifi es the parent's share of components previously recognised in OCI to profi t or loss or transferred directly to retained earnings, if required by other Ind ASs as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.

## c) Foreign currency

## Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All financial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these entities are largely restricted to importing of fi nished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash flows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The cash flows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The costs incurred by these entities are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The financing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been generally determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions, unless use of a different currency is considered appropriate.

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates diff erent from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous financial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

-  certain debt instruments classified as measured at FVTOCI;
-  certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value;
-  a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is eff ective; and
-  qualifying cash flow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are eff ective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash flows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash fl ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## Foreign operations

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR").

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is different from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the reporting currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the reporting currency at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency differences are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, such that control, signifi cant influence or joint control is lost, the relevant amount in the FCTR is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## d) Financial instruments

A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a fi nancial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

## Initial recognition and measurement

All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the fi nancial asset.

Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain significant financing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any significant financing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115 " Customers ".

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, fi nancial assets are classifi ed in four categories:

-  Debt instruments at amortised cost;
-  Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
-  Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
-  Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash fl ows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on specifi ed principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

<!-- image -->

After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the effective interest rate.

Interest income from these fi nancial assets is included in fi nance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in consolidated statement of profit and loss and presented in other income. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the fi nancial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash fl ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the OCI. However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the effective interest rate method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classifi ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies, are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss, even on sale of investment.

However, on sale the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Derecognition

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a fi nancial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheet) when:

-  the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
-  Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other fi nancial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another fi nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simplified approach" for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as fi nancial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.

All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative fi nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classifi cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classifi ed as held for trading unless they are designated as eff ective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk subsequently transferred to the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any fi nancial liability as FVTPL.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eff ective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the effective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any The effective interest rate amortisation is included as fi nance costs in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## Derecognition

A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modifi ed, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

<!-- image -->

## Derivative fi nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus, Australian dollars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, South African rands, Mexican pesos, Ukrainian hryvnias and Brazilian reals.

The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classified as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as fi nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative fi nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash flow hedges and measures them at fair value. The eff ective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as fi nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative fi nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash fl ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassified to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in OCI is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash fl ows.

## e) Business combinations and goodwill

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together signifi cantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it

significantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without significant cost, effort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is comprised of:

-  fair values of the assets transferred;
-  liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
-  equity interests issued by the Company;
-  fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
-  fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired, and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values. For each business combination, the Company elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifi able net assets.

Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Contingent consideration classifi ed as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Amounts classified as a fi nancial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of:

-  the consideration transferred,
-  the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and
-  the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity.

over the fair value of the net identifi able assets acquired.

If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess re-assesses whether it has correctly identified all of the reviews the procedures used to measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. If the reassessment still results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregate consideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as capital reserve. However, if there is no clear evidence of bargain purchase, the entity recognises the gain directly in equity as capital reserve, without routing the same through OCI.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

## f) Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use.

Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange differences to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Capital work in progress is stated at cost, net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.

<!-- image -->

An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Selling and other expense" in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefi ts embodied within the part will flow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                                 | Years    |
|---------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                   |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings      | 20 to 50 |
| - Ancillary structures                      | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and equipment                         | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, fi xtures and offi  ce equipment | 3 to 10  |
| Vehicles                                    | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## g) Goodwill and other intangible assets

| Goodwill                                                                                      |                |

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortization expense is recognised in the statement of profit and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| Particulars                 | Years   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 20 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 15 |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a finite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful lives or expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the assets are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate and are treated as change in accounting estimate.

development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic benefits are expected from loss, and are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## h) Leases

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies, if the contract asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis.

<!-- image -->

Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

-  fi xed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
-  variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date
-  amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees
-  the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
-  payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term refl ects the Company exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to consolidated statement of profit and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of the following:

-  the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
-  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
-  any initial direct costs, and
-  restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in consolidated statement of profit and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of offi ce furniture.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Company.

## i) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and finished goods. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition.

In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to reflect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## j) Impairment

## Non-fi nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefi nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March 2022.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as defined below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash infl ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the "cash-generating unit").

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, and reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## k) Employee benefi ts

## Short-term employee benefi ts

Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## Defi ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of qualifi ed obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related defi ned benefi t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the defined benefit plan, recognised in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss in employee benefit expense, reflects the increase in the defined benefit obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, benefit changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defi ned benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for defi ned benefit obligation and plan assets are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the benefits under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of profit and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a defined benefit plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

<!-- image -->

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefits are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an off er made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefi ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## l) Share-based payments

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to refl ect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount

recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.

The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss.

## m) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a fi nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when the expected benefits to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the consolidate statement of profit and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet,

with a corresponding credit to the specific expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated financial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an inflow of economic benefits is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## n) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unfulfilled obligations that could affect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates. Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

| Particulars                                                             |              |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| Sales of generic products in India                                      |              |
| Sales of active pharmaceutical  ingredients and intermediates in  India | the Company. |
| Export sales and other sales  outside of India                          |              |

## Profi t share revenues

arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price. The profit share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net profits, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide confirmation of units sold and net sales or net profit computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## and royalties

out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the

<!-- image -->

undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesalers for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesalers/other customers.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to reflect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition or otherwise. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better reflect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not specifi cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be off ered.

## Refund Liability

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of actual sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability, the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satisfied. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## o) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling and other expenses.

## p) Other income and fi nance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as it accrues, using the eff ective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash fl ows are classified as investing activities in the statement of cash flows. Finance cost consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss using the eff ective interest method. The associated cash flows are classified as fi nancing activities in the statement of cash fl ows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange diff erences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ineffective portion of cash fl ow hedges.

## q) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for fi nancial reporting purposes at the reporting date.

## Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary diff erences, except:

-  temporary diff erences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that aff ects neither accounting nor taxable profi t;
-  temporary diff extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
-  taxable temporary diff erences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:

-  deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the taxable profi t or loss;
-  In respect of deductible temporary diff erences associated with investments in subsidiaries, tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary diff available against which the temporary diff erences can be utilised

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary differences in respect of unrealised inter-company profit or loss on inventories held by the Company in different tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

<!-- image -->

Current and deferred tax is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in OCI or directly in equity, respectively.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax benefits are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax benefit and refl ects the effect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## r) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## s) Government grants and incentives

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of profi t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## t) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Chief Executive Offi cer of the Company is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and accordingly is identifi ed as the chief operating decision maker.

## u) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in consolidated statement of profit and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any diff erence between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## v) Non-currents assets held for sale

The Company classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding finance costs and income tax expense. The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Property, plant and equipment are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for sale. Assets classifi ed as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the consolidated balance sheet.

## w) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and notes have been rounded off to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 Determination of fair values

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain financial and non-fi nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes specifi c to that asset or liability.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which suffi cient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:

-  Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
-  Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
-  Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of signifi cant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and signifi cant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the Management, based on market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the benefits excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those benefi ts.

## c) Inventories

combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated margin based on the effort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash fl ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative fi nancial liabilities

Fair value, w hich is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For finance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have floating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

## h) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS 103, " Fair Value Measurement " refers to as Level 3 inputs.
