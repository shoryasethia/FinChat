## DEAR SHAREHOLDER,

FY2015 has been a good year for your Company. Let me begin by sharing with you the key results.

- · Consolidated net revenue increased by 12% over the previous year to ' 148.19 billion. This translated to US$ 2.38 billion.
- · Profi t before taxes (PBT) grew by 6% over the previous year to ' 28.16 billion, or US$ 452 million.
- · Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose by 9% to ' 36.17 billion, or 24% of consolidated revenue.
- · Profi ts after tax (PAT) increased by 3% to ' 22.18 billion, at 15% of consolidated net revenue.
- · Cash and cash equivalents (including other investments) rose by 18% to ' 39.65 billion as on 31 March 2015, or US$ 636 million.

Revenue from your Company's Global Generics business increased by 15% and stood at ' 120.56 billion. This was driven by North America, where revenues grew by 17%; by India, which registered a growth of 14%; and by Emerging Markets, which grew by 13% despite the sharp depreciation of the Russian rouble.

In Global Generics, North America performed well with revenues at ' 64.72 billion, thus crossing the US$ 1 billion mark. Twelve new products were launched during the year. Last quarter of FY2015 saw the commencement of OTC sales of Habitrol® - nicotine replacement therapy transdermal patches - a brand that was acquired from Novartis Consumer Health Inc. in November 2014.

We are well on track with the introduction of new generics in the US market. As of 31 March 2015, we have 68 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) fi led for approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). Of these, 43 are Para IV fi lings, and we believe that 13 of them have the 'First to File' status.

India Generics also performed satisfactorily. Revenues in FY2015

grew to ' 17.87 billion. In doing so, the business accounted for 15% of your Company's Global Generics sale, and 12% of total revenues. The only problem was in Russia and Ukraine, where the sharp depreciation of the rouble and the hryvnia, reduced revenues in rupee terms - although the business grew smartly in the local currencies.

FY2014 was a diffi cult year for the Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients (PSAI) business - one that saw declining revenues. That has been reversed. PSAI revenues in FY2015 increased by 6% to reach ' 25.46 billion; the business also posted signifi cant margin improvement due to a more profi table product mix. Regarding active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), we globally fi led 77 drug master fi les (DMFs) in FY2015, taking the cumulative number of DMF fi lings on 31 March 2015 to 735.

As your Company's founder, Dr. K. Anji Reddy always said, we are in the business of treating diseases and saving lives. We strive every day to do what matters most to patients - accelerating access to affordable medicines and fi nding intelligent solutions for unmet therapeutic needs. In this j ourney, we have steadily moved on from producing relatively simple APIs and formulations to diffi cult-toproduce APIs, complex generics including injectables, proprietary products and biosimilars - many of which deal with cancers, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, serious infections, gastrointestinal ailments, pain management, pediatrics and dermatology. With more than 2000 scientists across our development centers in India, the UK, the US and the Netherlands, we have the ability to leverage the best of global scientifi c talent.

Our skills in science and technology range from synthetic organic chemistry, development of biologics and formulation development to small-molecule-based drug discovery. These are complemented by specialized research facilities.

Our product development capabilities in India span synthetic organic

chemistry, analytical chemistry, process engineering, formulations development, polymorphism, bio-pharmaceutics, management of intellectual property and projects and regulatory science. Octoplus, our specialty research facility in the Netherlands, concentrates on development of injectables, which works better, longer and with fewer side effects. Chirotech, a facility located at Cambridge (UK) helps our custom pharmaceutical services business with its distinctive competencies in organic and bio-catalysis. And our biologics facility in Hyderabad has helped us build unique biotechnology capabilities and so create biosimilars for complex and expensive therapies and make them accessible to patients.

Your Company's commitment to fi nding new cures is evident in its focus on R&D. I am proud to inform you that in FY2015 alone R&D expenses grew by 41% to ' 17.45 billion, and accounted for 11.8% of sales, versus 9.4% in FY2014.

I look forward to an even better year in FY2016. A year when we will introduce new formulations, maintain best-inclass globally certifi ed scientifi c, technological and manufacturing facilities, and remain both strategic and nimble in providing complex medicines to meet critical therapeutic needs.

With the commitment of your Company's outstanding set of employees and your good wishes, I believe we will get there.

With best regards,

## GLOBAL GENERICS

Our Generics business helps make healthcare affordable by offering reasonably priced alternatives to expensive innovator medicines. Global generics is our biggest business driver. We offer over 200 high-quality generic drugs, keeping costs reasonable by leveraging our integrated operations. Our expertise in active ingredients, product development skills, a keen understanding of regulations and intellectual property rights, as well as our streamlined supply chain, makes us leaders in this segment.

## BIOLOGICS

Biologics, or biologically synthesized medicines, are increasingly preferred for the treatment of diseases like cancer and auto-immune disorders. Biologics offer higher effi cacy and fewer side effects, but are priced out of the reach of most patients. Our biosimilars, generic equivalents of the innovator's biologics, offer affordable yet equally effective alternatives. Our product development capabilities and commercial reach have made us global leaders in this therapeutic area. We have four products in the market and an industry-leading pipeline spanning oncology, nephrology and autoimmune diseases.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES & ACTIVE INGREDIENTS

## ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICALS INGREDIENTS

We are one of the world's largest manufacturers of Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (APIs) and partner with several leading innovator companies in bringing their molecules fi rst to market. An affordable API is key to reasonably priced medicines. Our focus on innovation-led affordability gives our customers access to the most complex active ingredients, while maintaining a consistent global quality standard. Besides, our APIs development efforts enable our own generics business to be cost competitive and get to market faster.

## CUSTOM PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES

Dr. Reddy's has one of the largest custom pharmaceutical services businesses in India. We offer end to end product development and manufacturing services and solutions to innovator companies. Our clients have access to the best technologies and a global delivery network. Further, our rich and extensive knowledge repository of various types of formulations helps shorten time to market and support lifecycle management. We have a well-earned reputation for bringing innovations to the market quickly, effi ciently and economically.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS

Our Proprietary Products business focuses on developing differentiated formulations that present signifi cantly enhanced benefi ts in terms of effi cacy, ease of use and the resolution of unmet patient needs. The aim is to improve the patient's holistic experience with our medicines, so as to strengthen compliance with the therapeutic regimen and ensure positive outcomes.

Dr. Reddy's is well positioned in the most signifi cant segments of the pharmaceutical value chain to make a big difference to patients around the world.

## REVENUE DISTRIBUTION AND GEOGRAPHICAL MIX FY2015 (%)

Good Health Can't Wait. Diseases don't care who pays for the medicine.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost anyone. According to the CDC, between 50 percent and 80 percent of adults in the United States have had a CMV infection by the age of 40.

## Strategy for Valganciclovir

Built predictability into the launch timeline

<!-- image -->

Estimates show that congenital (present at birth) CMV infection affects one in 150 children in the US. In adults, Valganciclovir is used to treat CMV retinitis (eye infection that can cause blindness) in people who have acquired immunodefi ciency syndrome (AIDS), and in people who have received an organ transplant (heart, kidney or kidney-pancreas).

In the pediatric population, Valganciclovir is used for the prevention of CMV disease in patients with kidney or heart transplant. Valganciclovir is in a class of medications called antivirals. It works by preventing the spread of CMV disease or slowing the growth of CMV.

We decided to bring this much-needed therapy to address this disease by accelerating the availability of an affordable option in this critical antiviral segment.

We pieced together a strategy for the product and more importantly built predictability into the launch timeline. Using information available in the public domain, information about the API Supply Chain, an IP strategy and litigation, we were able to launch the product ahead of all the others.

Used information available in the public domain and the API supply chain

Created an IP strategy

Launched product ahead of all others

Working closely with various cross-functional teams, such as R&D, Regulatory API and Manufacturing across geographies, we were able to successfully navigate the legal requirements and launch the product in an accelerated time frame.

That day we broke a boundary. Not just for our Company, but for the industry as a whole. We created a new pathway to the patient, one that is more affordable, equally high quality and just as effective.

We overcame the skepticism of peers to meet a huge unmet need. Our supply chain management teams ensured the complex drug was available on shelf within a short period of approval. Since its launch in December 2014, nearly 40% of patients in the US are now using Dr. Reddy's Valganciclovir and today we still remain an affordable option in bringing this critical medicine to patients.

Children and adults can now look forward to an affordable option for the treatment of CMV. This encourages us to continue to seek new ways to make expensive medication affordable and improve patients' lives.

Good Health Can't Wait. Little children can't wait to smile.

Vesicoureteral Refl ux (VUR) is an uncommon disease that mostly affl icts little children around the world. A bladder valve defect, VUR leads to infected urine traveling back from the bladder through one or both ureters up to the kidneys. This increases the likelihood of urinary tract infection (UTI), scarring of kidneys and if not treated, can result in kidney failure.

Given that VUR is rare, its treatment options are few and inconvenient. They include antibiotics and surgery that involve long hospital stay and painful procedures. Not only is this diffi cult for children under six, it is also an expensive proposition.

At Dr. Reddy's, we believe limited treatment options should not be a hurdle to care. Even for rare diseases that affect only a few people, our aim is to respond with urgency to offer affordable and innovative solutions.

A safe, affordable alternative approach to treating VUR, therefore, became a mission for us.

Following extensive research and coordination with multiple teams, we tied up with Oceana Therapeutics Inc. to import Defl ux®, a minimally invasive endoscopic injection to treat Grade II-IV VUR effectively with 80-90% success rate. It provides a higher level of protection against infection, compared to antibiotics, and has an excellent safety profi le. Independent studies also established that there was nearly a four-fold reduction in

painful and more affordable

Our next step was to make pediatric surgeons aware of the availability of a viable therapy and also train them in its proper use. We organized special crossspecialty meetings for pediatricians and pediatric surgeons to inform doctors of the benefi ts of the drug and facilitate early diagnosis. We also collaborated with Olympus (a medical device company) to provide pediatric surgeons with an expensive device used for injecting Defl ux®. As a result, we have been able to treat more than 280 children in India till date. smile more. VUR can be the treatment is faster, less - an encouraging reality for

Small children can now smile more. VUR can be effectively managed, as the treatment is faster, less - an encouraging reality for doctors and families of the affected children.

## Medication can't be taken lightly.

## Good Health Can't Wait.

We are always seeking new ways to improve our products, packaging and services to enhance patient care. The basis for our actions comes from robust insights generated by talking to patients. These deep discussions with patients help us understand their unstated needs.

## Redesigned packaging for patient convenience

Color-coded pack extensions

Dosing matrix included on pack

Critical information clearly displayed

Packs designed to hold 14 pills

In our research, we found patients often forget to take their prescribed drug, interrupting the treatment cycle; or sometimes the dosage information is not visible from the packaging once he or she has started taking a particular medicine. There are many such daily challenges that the patient has to encounter. These critical priorities encouraged us to redesign our drug packaging, keeping our patients' convenience in mind.

The result is an innovative, patient-centric blister packaging that brings about signifi cant advantages and facilitates adherence to medicine and convenience for the patient. We introduced this innovative packaging for our Reclimet-XR, Bilefi x™ and Olsertain-CT™ brands in the Indian market.

First, the pack extensions are color-coded with a dual purpose: to help patients identify a particular medicine among the rest of his or her medication; the extensions also enhance the ease of repurchase. Second, we provide a dosing matrix to record the doctor's prescription on the pack itself, so that there is no need to refer to the prescription for the exact dosing. Third, the brand name, expiry date and MRP are clearly marked on the

pack extension. These are not removed even if the patient consumes pills from the pack (a very common problem found with most blister and strip packages in India). The white color of the aluminum foil gives a paper-like reading experience by reducing glares and refl ections.

<!-- image -->

We learnt from our patient interviews that week-based purchase rituals are better suited for adherence to the treatment cycle than monthbased rituals. We therefore specially designed our packs to have 14 pills to ensure patients do not fail to take their medicines regularly and help them move from a monthly to a weekly buying pattern.

To take our innovation from the drawing board to a manufacturing reality, we redesigned parts of machines in our facilities and trained our people for the purpose. We will be extending these insights and innovations to multiple other products and dosage formats.

Small things matter, like making the pill consuming experience as hassle-free as possible for patients. These incremental innovations in packaging will surely help our patients manage their disease better. While we can defi nitely do a lot more, this is a good start.

Venezuela is a country blessed with rich oil and gas reserves. Its citizens have been largely prosperous and the economy strong.

All that changed in 2014 with a steep drop in the global oil prices - the key income stream of the Venezuelan government.

Coupled with other events, this led to a steep decline in the situation, and a scarcity of essential commodities, including medicines. So sudden was the change, that citizens did not even realize that this was happening.

For Dr. Reddy's it was a time to demonstrate our commitment to the purpose and values of our organization in Venezuela, and to the millions we served for 15 years. It was a challenging situation, especially because we had to understand the nuances of market behavior in the context of the socio-economic conditions. We were able to read the situation and get early indicators, regarding specifi c availability issues.

Putting our organizational capabilities to use, we were the fi rst to respond to the needs of patients and our channel partners. We ensured that our products were available to patients, where required, through independent pharmacies, retail chains and insurance pharmacies. We received solid support from our back-end and supply chain management, to fi rst understand the

need and then respond with agility and speed.

Therefore, when availability became a critical factor in choosing a brand, we had a natural advantage. We were able to reach out to many more patients in the year. Our effective planning gave us a minimum lead time saving of three to four months on an average.

Registered growth in units

## 141 %

Emerged as the fastest growing company in FY2015 despite unfavorable market conditions

Reliable provider of Zovanta™, Plagril™, Omez®, Olanzapina

We supported this reputation with regular information dissemination regarding availability and promotions.

This was appreciated, and served as an assurance to doctors and pharmacies in serving patients.

As a result, we emerged as the fastest growing company in FY2015, registering a 141% growth in units. Our reputation as a reliable provider of medicines such as Zovanta™, Plagril™, Omez® and Olanzapina, helped us become a partner of choice for medical professionals.

## Good health takes everyone along.

Good Health Can't Wait.

Effective healthcare cannot be viewed through the limited prism of managing ailments alone. It is beyond that. The role of meaningful communication between the care provider and the patient is critical in this context.

Dr. Reddy's Foundation for Health Education (DRFHE) was founded to bring patients and care providers closer.

90

<!-- image -->

Patients want to be heard, understood and treated like individuals. They know the importance of good health and want to be a part of the decision-making process. Active engagement with providers gives them the confi dence to manage their conditions better. On the contrary, ineffective communication can hamper the process of healing. Therefore, profi ciency in communication on the part of care providers is important to convey the message that 'we care'.

Dr. Reddy's Foundation for Health Education (DRFHE) was founded to bring patients and care providers closer. Through its various programs, DRFHE attempts to aid hospitals in improving their readiness to match the expectations of patients.

Studies show that effective communication and counseling contribute to faster and complete healing. The Foundation's programs touch all

We initiated a day-long program called Akriti for orthopedicians in 2015 to help them manage patients with better understanding of emotional intelligence as well as transactional analysis. A team of 90 outsourced trainers, conduct pan-India programs through module-based interventions.

The workshop sensitized doctors to the need for developing better communication techniques with patients.

We believe care providers have to go beyond the 'stated and obvious' to develop a holistic perspective of patient needs. We will continue to drive initiatives to strengthen engagements between patients and care providers.

The specifi c features of the three products are detailed below:

## Eslicarbazepine acetate

Eslicarbazepine acetate is considered to be a second generation drug to oxacarbazepine and a third generation drug to carbamazepine, meant for treating epilepsy. As a pro drug to (S)-licarbazepine, Eslicarbazepine acetate is evolved in order to have improved effi cacy and safety preventing the formation of toxic epoxide metabolite.

Our previously reported synthesis involved a resolution strategy, which by design, yielded a maximum of 50% conversion. This process left behind almost the same quantity of material as waste, along with a significant quantity of liquid and solid effluents. We adopted an asymmetric reduction method, allowing for 80% yield. We also avoided a significant amount of waste. As a result, our manufacturing process has become energy efficient.

## Voriconazole

Voriconazole has become the new standard of care in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. This condition may occur in immunocompromised patients, including allogeneic BMT, hematologic cancers and solid organ transplants.

Our previously reported synthesis involved a resolution strategy, which by design, yielded a maximum of 50% conversion. This process left behind almost the same quantity of material as waste, along with a signifi cant quantity of liquid and solid effl uents. We adopted the diastereoselcetive coupling method, allowing for relatively higher yields and selectivity. Eventually, a signifi cant amount of waste was avoided, making the manufacturing process more energy effi cient.

## Pregabalin

(S)-3-(Aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid ((S)-Pregabalin) is a 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) analogue. Our Pregabalin is used as an anticonvulsant drug to treat epilepsy, anxiety and social phobia.

Our previously reported synthesis involved a resolution strategy, which by design, yielded a maximum of 50%

our initiatives in this area include:

- Imparting mandatory supplier trainings for new vendors;
- Sharing good practices through audits and workshops;
- Reworking packaging design to reduce carbon footprint; and
- Inculcating a culture of resource conservation among local and small producers.

Additionally, we improved solvent recovery effi ciencies and eliminated the use of hazardous solvents like Methylene Dichloride.

- 5. Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and waste? If yes what is the percentage of recycling of products and waste (separately as <5%, 5-10%, >10%). Also, provide details thereof, in about 50 words or so.

Yes, we do have a mechanism to recycle products and waste.

We practice the alternate reuse of potassium salts in our CTO (Chemical Technical Operations). Nearly 3,000

TPA of potassium salt, generated from evaporation processes, is disposed to authorized recyclers to produce valuable fertilizers. Potash is reprocessed by a recycler and 2,000 TPA of potassium salt is produced on a dry basis.

Of the 2,000 TPA potassium salt produced, 800 T of chloride-free salt is used for the cultivation on 4,000 acres. About 400 T is sold as fertilizer for horticulture crops like palm oil, cocoa, coconut, sugarcane and more, covering 4,000 acres.

The balance 800 T is given to the oil drilling sector, which enables savings in foreign exchange.

These initiatives have helped us minimize the hazardous waste to landfi ll, by completely reusing the salts with an annual savings of ' 84 lakhs.

We also reuse waste at our Formulation Technical Operations (FTOs).

During the year, we commissioned an ETP Sludge dewatering facility, which

At Dr. Reddy's, we build lasting bonds with all our stakeholders through meaningful deliberations. This process helps us review our actions, rethink our roadmap, redress grievances and recognize new avenues of growth.

Table 3 details our engagement platforms for each stakeholder group.

reduced sludge generation from 648 T/ annum to 480 T/annum, resulting in an annual savings of ' 10.8 lakhs.

Our FTOs identifi ed Geocycle as an alternate vendor for the disposal of market returned goods, such as expired pharmaceutical products. Earlier these were disposed to a Sludge Disposal Facility (SDF). Through Geocycle, we have been able to reduce around 800 T/annum of disposal to incineration at TSDF.

We have also taken up similar initiatives at our other business units to recycle the waste generated.

Equally, thanks to variations of one form of the Eurozone crisis to another, European spending on healthcare is not expected to witness much growth. Across Latin America, spending is projected to increase at an average of 4.6% per year over 2014-2018, as several governments attempt to improve their public healthcare systems amid general budget constraints.

The growth is expected to be rapid in the Middle East and Africa, which could see an annual average increase of 8.7% over 2014-2018 - due, in part, to population growth and efforts to expand access to healthcare.

By 2018, among the large geographical blocks, North America's share of global pharmaceutical market is expected to remain stable at over 41%. Asia-Pacifi c's share is expected to rise to almost 29%; while that of Western Europe is expected to reduce to 17%.

## NORTH AMERICA

USA continues to remain the largest pharmaceuticals market representing over one third of the global total. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of around 5% through 2018, signifi cantly higher than the 3.6% growth over the past fi ve years. Strong economic recovery in the USA coupled with recent healthcare reforms have already had a positive impact on the use of medicines. This is expected to grow the market through the fi rst half of the forecast period.

Implementation of the Affordable Care Act will have a positive impact on demand for medicines during the fi rst half of the forecast period due to expanded enrolment in the state-funded Medicaid programs and increased use of tax credits to purchase private health insurance. However, expanded coverage will increase budgetary pressure on payers, with drug spending being a popular target for cost containment.

The Economist Intelligence Unit also expects healthcare spending in the USA to rise by around 5% in nominal terms in 2015. Of developed markets, the USA will see the largest per capita health spend increase from 2013 to 2018, while other developed countries such as France and Spain will see a fall due to implementation of policies to control spending growth.

- to the sharp depreciation of the rouble.
- Revenues from India stood at ' 17.87 billion registering a yearon-year growth of 14%.
- Revenue from the Rest of the World (RoW) territories was ' 13.06 billion and grew by 77%.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

- 77 Drug Master Files (DMFs) wer e fi led globally, including 12 in the US and 16 in Europe. The cumulative number of DMF as on 31 March 2015 was 735.
- Revenues from PSAI stood at ' 25.46 billion registering a yearon-year growth of 6%. Despite moderate sales growth, the margins improved signifi cantly due to a better product mix.

## OUTLOOK FOR THE GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY

The global pharmaceutical market seems to be showing signs of recovery with several positive factors projected for the next four to fi ve years. Global spending on medicines is expected to reach US$ 1.3 trillion by 2018, representing a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) varying between 5-6% on a constant currency basis for the forecast period of 2014-2018. This is slightly higher than the 5.2% growth rate recor ded over the past fi ve years.

Higher growth is primarily on account of general economic well being, the effect of aging populations and chronic/lifestyle diseases on the demand side - and the introduction of new specialty medicines and increased accessibility of patients to medical infrastructure and funding, expansion of emerging markets and advances in treatment and allied technologies on the supply side.

On a regional basis, healthcare spending in North America is expected to increase on an average by approximately 5% per year during 2014-2018. This expenditure is expected to be partly driven by expanded consumer access to healthcare through the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and partly because of the introduction of new medicines as well as the general economic recovery of the area.

## PHARMERGING MARKETS

- Tier 1: China;

Pharmerging markets are defi ned as those with more than US$ 1 billion absolute spending growth over 2014-18 and which have GDP per capita of less than US$ 25,000 at purchasing power parity (PPP). These include:

- Tier 2: Brazil, India, Russia; and
- Tier 3: Mexico, Turkey, Venezuela, Poland, Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Colombia, Thailand, Ukraine, South Africa, Egypt, Romania, Algeria, Vietnam, Pakistan and Nigeria.

Pharmerging markets have long been regarded as the 'promised land' of the pharmaceutical industry. Given the slow growth of pharmaceutical sales in developed markets, multinational companies have made substantial investments in emerging markets in recent years. With their large populations, increasing prosperity, and improving longevity, these territories are very attractive to companies that are suffering from stagnation of mature markets, patent expirations, and increased regulatory hurdles.

Pharmerging markets are expected to move from representing a fourth of the global pharmaceutical market in 2012 to a third by 2017. The growth will mainly be driven by government healthcare investment, private and out-of-pocket spend, and the increasing burden of chronic disease. Between 2012 and 2017, pharmerging markets will have growth rates far higher than mature markets. The forecast for the former is at a CAGR of 13% during 2012-2017 compared to 2% for the top eight mature markets. This will represent two-thirds of global pharmaceutical growth and will increase the pharmerging markets' global share from 23% in 2012 to 33% in 2017, with all four BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) ranking among the top10 by value of sales. Chart A gives the data.

## INDIA'S FORMULATIONS MARKET

The Indian pharmaceutical market grew at a CAGR of approximately 14% in the past fi ve years and is expected to grow at a CAGR of between 9% and 12% to reach around US$ 20 billion to US$ 30 billion by 2018. This is being, and will be, driven by epidemiological factors, increasing affordability, enhanced accessibility and rising acceptability - though partially offset by pricing

controls put in place by the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) and high levels of competition due to existing market fragmentation.

The government and regulatory authorities continue to focus on: (a) reduced taxes and import duties; (b) incentives for setting up manufacturing units through special economic zones and other facilities; (c) incentives for higher in-house research and development; and (d) improving the quality of healthcare infrastructure as well as the availability of medicines through the 'Jan Aushadhi' scheme at affordable prices.

## ACTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL INGREDIENTS AND INTERMEDIATES

The global active pharmaceutical ingredients market is currently valued at approximately US$ 120 billion and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 7% to reach US$ 180 billion by 2020. Over the years, some large pharmaceutical corporations have tended to be vertically integrated for critical products. Simultaneously, others have favored using trusted external sources for their APIs and intermediates sourcing. Countries like India and China have continued to benefi t from this external sourcing strategy.

## EMERGING TRENDS IN THE GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL SPACE

POSITIVE TRENDS

- Increasing contribution of the Indian generics players in the largest pharmaceutical market, namely the US generic prescriptions (Gx) market. Based on a review of the ANDA approvals, it is evident that Indian generic players have, over time, increased their share in the US Gx market. Today, Indian companies are the second-largest suppliers of pharmaceutical products to the US. Charts B and C speak for themselves.
- Generics price infl ation. Generic pharmaceutical companies have been credited with getting the off-patent branded price down by 50% to 99% depending on the competitive intensity. However, of late there have been instances of price increases of some generics products. The predominant cause of this has been supply disruptions due to the USFDA restricting some companies from selling in the US

## CHART D: BRAND VALUE GOING OFF-PATENT

- Epidemiological factors. Population growth in emerging markets coupled with a steady rise in the disease prevalence is set to increase the size of the global patient pool. Moreover, the disease profi le of countries like India and China is also changing with continued increase in chronic cases attributable to an aging population, more sedentary lifestyles, diet changes, rising obesity levels, coupled with improved diagnostics. All these factors augur in favor of a signifi cant increase in the use of medicines.
- GDUFA to enable faster approvals. The Generics Drug User Fees Amendments (GDUFA), 2012, of the USFDA is designed to speed access to safe and effective generic drugs to the public and reduce costs to industry. The law requires industry to pay user fees to supplement the costs of reviewing generic drug applications and inspecting facilities. Such additional resources should enable the USFDA to reduce the current backlog of pending applications and cut the average time required to review generic drug applications.
- Increasing accessibility and affordability. With most global economies returning to the growth track, another cycle of rising disposable incomes is expected, primarily across emerging economies. This trend plus a reasonably steady growth in health insurance coverage should help in increasing affordability of medicines among the patient communities. Besides, accessibility to healthcare, diagnostic interventions and pharmaceutical products is expected to expand due to growth in medical infrastructure, new business models for TierII towns and rural areas, new product launches (patented, proprietary products, complex generics and biosimilars) and greater government spending on healthcare.
- R&D productivity. Even as scientifi c uncertainty looms and most low hanging fruits have been picked up, pharmaceutical companies are pushing the boundaries of innovation to address issues like extended release technology, the treatment of diabetes, CNS, HIV and cancer, injectable technology,
- and slower ANDA approvals. The IMS data for the period JanuaryMarch 2015 shows an upward trend in prices ( ≥ 10%) across 50-plus products. This is likely to continue for some time till the ANDA backlog gets cleared and/or manufacturing/ quality related issues get resolved with USFDA.
- The injectable opportunity. There is a good opportunity for Indian generic companies to grow from injectable launches. Some US$ 16 billion of injectable product patents will expire in the US over the next four years. The US generic injectable market is today at around US$ 7.6 billion in sales. It is expected to grow at approximately 10% per year faster than orals and other generic categories.
- Brand price infl ation. Over the past few years, a set of branded drugs that are to come off patent protection in the near future have taken systemic price increases. This has accelerated from around 6% to nearly 9% annually in the past fi ve years. The number of branded drugs that have effected price hikes has also accelerated. As an example, in 2005, brands equaled 50% of total US prescriptions with sales of US$ 230 billion. In 2014, the share of brands was down to 20% of total prescriptions, but their sales revenue was US$ 316 billion - and much of this 38% increase over the decade was on account of price rises in the last fi ve years. With US$ 102 billion worth of branded drugs scheduled to go off patents between 2015 and 2020 (see Chart D ), this could not only set the stage for pre-expiry price increases but also for a much greater scope for generics.
- Settlement with innovator companies. Although long drawn out product patent battles continue between innovators and patentchallenging generic companies, there has been a trend in favor of out-of-court settlements - which close the litigations, with the concerned parties deciding on the terms and date of the generic product launch. It is diffi cult to predict whether such settlements will dominate in the years to come; but wherever these occur, the process will certainly reduce excessively high legal costs of patent defense and generic entry.

Anti-cancer treatments still attract the largest R&D investments. Leading Indian generics companies will attempt to increase the pace of differentiated fi lings in the US, especially in limited competition areas.

among Pharmacy Benefi t Managers (PBMs) in the US. This has resulted in higher bargaining power for PBMs vis-à-vis manufacturers. Despite consequential pricing pressures, large manufacturers are likely to benefi t by:

- b. being able to provide a large basket of products; and
- a. being a stable and reliable supply source;
- c. deriving a higher proportion of revenues from complex generics, where the number of manufacturers or suppliers is limited.
- Emerging support technologies. Three technologies will play an increasingly important role in bettering our health care systems. The fi rst is bioinformatics. With major sequencing of the human genome and further expansion of bioinformatics, we are able to see molecular pathways in new light and draw linkages between diseases. The second is big data. Increasing use of big data will help unlock personalized medicine and improve patient response rates, reduce development times and choose safer therapies. The third is wearable technology, which has the potential to advance remote patient monitoring, patient compliance and self-care. We are already seeing the trend take hold. For example, Google recently unveiled a contact lens containing a small silicon chip which helps detection of sugar levels for diabetic patients.

## CONCERNS

- Price controls. These are prevalent in many pharmerging markets, some with generic substitutes (branded or unbranded) and some without. For instance, Russia implemented price controls through reference price model for prescription drugs in April 2010, which covered nearly 40% of the market by value. In 2013, India enhanced the scope of price controls from 74 (12% of the market by value) to over 350 molecules (or 34% of the market by value). This has certainly affected the economics of pharmaceutical companies in such markets, although the impact across companies has varied depending on their sale of such listed drugs.

biotech interventions as well as incremental innovations to meet niche unmet medical needs. Large pharmaceutical companies will increase focus on R&D to develop new chemical or molecular entities in their attempt to move up the value chain. There is an extensive line-up of diabetes and cancer drugs in late-stage development, with about half of these focusing on cancer and HIV. Anti-cancer treatments still attract the largest R&D investments. Leading Indian generics companies will attempt to increase the pace of differentiated fi lings in the US, especially in limited competition areas like dermatology, ophthalmic, injectable, transdermal patches, oncology and respiratory, which collectively offer a US$ 50 billion plus opportunity. Governments in emerging markets such as China and India are providing robust funding to kick-start their countries' biotechnology industries. The number of product patents coming from emerging economies has increased by double digits over the past few years. Recognizing these countries' growing capabilities, many leading pharmaceutical and biotech companies are outsourcing certain R&D activities to these geographies.

- Channel consolidation in the US. Over the last three years, there have been a number of big-ticket M&As
- Consolidation within the industry. There has been a wave of consolidation within the industry. Rising demand for generic drugs, start-ups holding differentiated product and technology offerings, loss of revenue with the expiry blockbuster patents, among others, are some of the driving force behind this consolidation wave. Both research-based innovator enterprises and development based generics companies are looking for acquisitions of all sizes. Large pharmaceutical companies are acquiring biotech fi rms, especially if their products are in late-stage development or showcase new technology. It remains to be seen whether the recent surge in M&A activities signals the beginning of a general recovery or refl ects the only way that companies can grow in an industry facing considerable pricing pushback from payors and patients.

systems, data integrity and product safety. Some of these have led to import restrictions coupled with large fi nancial penalties. Dr. Reddy's welcomes such inspections. Equally, it believes that where such observations are relatively minor in nature - and are appropriately addressed by the audited company - the USFDA should resolve these outstanding issues as quickly as possible. Having said so, it is important to recognize that, despite following best-in-class good manufacturing practices (GMP) norms, there remain risks of adverse USFDA action -which, in turn, might delay the monetization of opportunities in the US.

## DR. REDDY'S MARKET PERFORMANCE FOR FY2015

This section starts with Table 1 which summarizes Dr. Reddy's performance in different markets and product segments; and then goes on to describe matters in greater detail.

## NORTH AMERICA GENERICS

North America remains an important growth engine for Dr. Reddy's. Revenues from the region grew by 17% to ' 64.7 billion in FY2015 - thus crossing the US$ 1 billion mark. b We are the 9th largest generics pharmaceutical company in the US.

- USFDA inspections. Any importing country's drug administrator has the right to, and duty of, periodically inspecting and certifying the manufacturing facilities of the exporting pharmaceutical companies. This fact is readily accepted by all. Over the last few years, such audits on Indian generics manufacturers have substantially increased in their number and frequency, especially those carried out by the USFDA. On occasions, the USFDA inspectors have noted several Form 483 observations - which, in their opinion, are possible infringements of established standards in manufacturing, testing, quality

- Diffi cult economic and geopolitical situations in major emerging markets. Through the year, several pharmaceutical companies have been affected by such events, especially in Russia, Ukraine and Venezuela. In FY2015, Russia witnessed a very sharp depreciation of the rouble versus the US dollar which, in turn, negatively affected all imports including those of pharmaceutical products. Ukraine was hit by serious political and military confl ict which created signifi cant uncertainties and affected the market. Despite being an excellent market for pharmaceutical products, Venezuela's mechanism of having multiple administered exchange rates and severe controls on dollar repatriations have constrained business in the country.

supplied generics to the US market. However, the Company's business maintained its growth momentum on the back of:

- (ii) 12 new launches, including major products like Valganciclovir and Sirolimus.
- (i) Market share gains in some of the key molecules such as azacitadine, decitabine and atorvastatin. Of these, sales of the fi rst two crossed US$ 100 million each.
- (iii) Consolidating/sustaining the market position of key injectables launched in FY2014. Our injectable franchise - comprising assets that have limited competition - continues to be a critical component, accounting for over a fourth of the total North America generics business.

Dr. Reddy's OTC portfolio is a signifi cant component of the overall performance in the US. We are currently ranked 2nd in the store brand OTC space. This segment is poised for rapid growth in the coming

years with increasing coverage and 'prescription' (Rx) to 'OTC' switches.

Our store brand OTC offerings got strengthened with the acquisition of Habitrol® brand - an OTC nicotine replacement therapy transdermal patch - from Novartis Consumer Health Inc. Based on a consent order from the US Federal Trade Commission on 26 November 2014, Dr. Reddy's has now formally acquired the title and rights of Habitrol® brand and the permission to market the product in the US. Thus, FY2015 includes revenues from Habitrol® for January-March 2015.

## RUSSIA AND CIS

CY2014 saw a major slowdown in the volume growth of the Russian pharmaceutical market, on account of price controls and the slowdown of an economy that is heavily dependent on oil and gas export prices. According to the IMS, the market by volume grew by only 1%, one of the lowest in recent

The business also deepened its commitment to the medium-term growth drivers - OTC, institutions, and corporate hospitals - by augmenting teams dedicated for these channels. Additionally, go-to-market innovation efforts were driven through multiple technology-based patient-care services for super-specialty and chronic drugs. These services are aimed at improving access to medicines by providing hassle-free fi nancial support, enhancing diagnosis through appropriate diagnostic subsidies and detection camps, and driving better patient outcomes through therapy adherence support.

## REST OF THE WORLD (ROW)

For us, RoW includes markets like Venezuela and South Africa, in addition to Australia, New Zealand and Southeast Asia. Led by Venezuela, this business has shown impressive growth with consistent rise in volume and value uptake.

Venezuela has been the growth driver. We have stayed committed to the country despite its economic diffi culties and have continued to ensure consistent supply of drugs to patients at affordable prices. Consequently, we have enjoyed a revenue CAGR of 52% between FY2011 and FY2015. In FY2015, sales in Venezuela increased by 187% to become Dr. Reddy's fourth largest market.

The supply of pharmaceuticals in this country is heavily dependent on imports, which has grown at a CAGR of almost 18% from 2008 to 2013. Even so, pharmacies face shortages of essential medicines. There is a signifi cant growth potential. The country's pharmaceutical market was approximately US$ 10 billion in 2013 and is projected to reach US$ 22.2 billion by 2020 at a CAGR of 12%. The elderly population accounted for 6.3% of the total Venezuelan population in 2013, which is expected to rise to 7.8% in 2020. Chronic conditions associated with changes in lifestyle and increasing population are primary drivers for this market.

However, growth is dependent upon the resolution of concerns related to repatriation of foreign currency, drug pricing policy, currency devaluation and how the country treats pharmaceutical

years. Even so, in value terms, the growth for CY2014 was 13%, thanks to an impressive growth in the hospital sector and rising prices in the retail and OTC markets towards the end of 2014. Chart E gives the IMS estimates for CY2014.

In this context, our volumes grew by 5% in FY2015. In value terms, we grew at 13%, which was as fast as the Russian market as a whole. Our growth was driven by hospital sales and price increases in select permitted molecules. OTC continues to remain an important lever, clocking in at 36% of sales. Our focus is to continue strengthening our presence across all three channels - Rx , OTC and hospitals through a stronger differentiated product portfolio with relevant in-house and inlicensed products.

## INDIA

India generics business growth was driven by strong performance of the top brands within the portfolio, which contribute close to 50% of sales. More than two-thirds of the top brands grew faster than their respective markets - which was achieved through rigorous execution of marketing and sales excellence initiatives. Our super specialty and chronic category brands grew further due to a well calibrated sales force expansion.

A key driver of growth was the increased productivity from the 18 new products launched by the domestic business on account of the focus on fi rst-tomarket/differentiated products and superior launch planning efforts. Key launches included Resof TM (sofosbuvir for Hepatitis C), Melgain® (for the treatment of white patches on skin, or vitiligo), Defl ux® (for the treatment of vesico-uretic refl ux), Reclimet XR (a combination of gliclazide and metformin for Type-2 diabetes) and Acrofy TM (a moisturizer for acne).

Our top brand, Omez®, received the AWACS Marketing Excellence Award for robust performance despite facing sharp price reductions on account of omeprazole falling under the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM) in India. Razo-D® achieved the coveted top-300 ranking among all the brands of the Indian pharmaceutical market.

## CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALS

## FINANCIALS

## REVENUES

Revenues increased by 12% to ' 148,189 million in FY2015. Revenue growth was largely driven by our Global Generics segment's operations in the North America, Venezuela and India. Adverse exchange rates movement resulted in lower reported revenues because of the decrease in Indian rupee realization from sales in euro and Russian rouble.

## GROSS PROFIT

Gross profi t rose by 13% to ' 85,403 million in FY2015. This translates to a gross profi t margin of 57.6% in FY2015 versus 57.4% in FY2014. The gross profi t margin for Global Generics was 65.2%; and for the PSAI business, it was 22.4%.

After taking into account the impact of the exchange rate fl uctuations of the Indian rupee against multiple currencies in the markets in which the Company operates, gross profi ts from our Global Generics segment decreased due to impact of changes in our existing business mix (i.e., a fall in the share of sales of higher gross margin products and an increase in the share of relatively lower gross margin products). Factors that positively affected gross profi t margins for the PSAI segment include an increase in

imports. Despite uncertainties, we continue to remain positive about our therapy focused fi rst to market approach in this market.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

Our PSAI segment includes active pharmaceutical ingredients, intermediates and contract research services business.

The latest report from Transparency Market Research on active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) suggests that the segment, currently valued at approximately US$120 billion, is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 7% to reach US$180 billion by 2020. There has also been an increase in the infl uence of API players from emerging economies, especially India and China, which is expected to continue going forward.

Although the life cycle of API emulates that of a commodity business, we expect our PSAI segment to show growth thanks to our investments in newer technologies and platforms of the future. We are also pursuing a partnership model to enable our customers to reach more markets faster and effi ciently by leveraging our cost leadership and presence across the globe. We continue to be one of the signifi cant API players in the industry, supporting internally as well as global customers such as Teva, Mylan, Sandoz, Actavis among others. Over one-third of our API sales in FY2015 wer e to the top fi ve generics players in the world.

Our focus on leadership development and talent management was further strengthened this year. We continue to invest in our leadership development program which is built on the four tenets of 'Lead Self, Lead Others, Lead Change and Lead Business'.

Dr. Reddy's is an employer of choice for women. We lay special emphasis on helping our women colleagues grow professionally and personally as a part of our strategy to attract and retain the best talent in the industry. This year we made distinct progress in this area and rolled out our enabling policies and programs to help enhance gender diversity. Our focus on productivity also got an impetus as we benchmarked our productivity with industry and executed organizational design interventions that focused on delayering, reducing spans, sharply defi ning roles and agreeing on tighter manning norms. We also launched our new HR IT portal to help automate key HR processes.

## OUTLOOK

The Company believes that its focus on profi table growth and targeting a leadership position in Global Generics and PSAI will create signifi cant value in the near term.

In GG, improving depth through portfolio expansion, cost leadership, consistent delivery of limited competition products and supply chain excellence should lead us to leadership positions in key markets. In PSAI, the objective is to be the partner of choice by creating compelling value

The Finance, Investment and Risk Management Council (or FIRM Council), is the Company's management committee that helps the ERM function to prioritize organization-wide risks, review and steer mitigation efforts in line with the Company's risk capacity and appetite. T he FIRM council also oversees fi nancial risk management and capital allocation decisions.

## REVIEWING THE STATUS OF MITIGATION AND RESIDUAL RISKS

The Head of Dr. Reddy's ERM team provides periodic updates to the FIRM Council and the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. These include: (i) quarterly updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks, and (ii) specifi c initiatives carried out on risks during the year.

During FY2015, the ERM team facilitated mitigation for certain geo-political and country risks, on forex and devaluation of currencies, on transfer risk and on people security. The team enhanced its key risk indicator tracking capabilities, developed a loss-data tracker and constructed a key learning's summary for the year. On fi nancial risk management, the team helped in developing a framework to enable making capital allocation decisions. It also assisted management in documentation and review of internal fi nancial controls as required by the Companies Act, 2013.

The Company has a positive outlook for the next year. The largest increment of growth is expected to be contributed by the North America generics and Emerging Markets businesses.

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited (Dr. Reddy's or the Company) believes that timely disclosures, transparent accounting policies and a strong and independent Board go a long way in maintaining good corporate governance, preserving shareholders' trust and maximizing long-term corporate value.

Given the Company's size and complexity in operations, Dr. Reddy's corporate governance framework is based on the following main principles:

- Proactive fl ow of accurate information to the members of the Board and Board Committees to enable effective discharge of fi duciary duties
- Appropriate composition and size of the Board, with each Director bringing in key expertise in different areas
- Ethical business conduct by the Board, management and employees
- Protect and facilitate the exercise of shareholders' rights
- Well-developed systems and processes for internal controls across all operations, risk management and fi nancial reporting
- Adequate, timely and accurate disclosure of all material, operational and fi nancial information to the stakeholders

In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates corporate

governance for listed companies through Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement. Dr. Reddy's is in full compliance with Clause 49. It is also in compliance with the applicable corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

This chapter of the annual report together with information given under the chapters entitled Management Discussion and Analysis and Additional Shareholders' Information constitute the compliance report of the Company on corporate governance during FY2015.

## BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPOSITION

As on 31 March 2015, the Board of Dr. Reddy's had 10 Directors, comprising (i) two Executive Directors, including the Chairman, and (ii) eight Independent Directors, including a woman Director, as defi ned under the Companies Act, 2013, the SEBI's Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement and the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Detailed profi les of the Directors have been put forth in this annual report.

The Directors have expertise in the fi elds of strategy, management, fi nance, operations, science, technology, human resource development and economics. The Board provides leadership, strategic guidance, objective and an independent view to the Company's management while discharging its fi duciary responsibilities, thereby ensuring that the management adheres to high standards of ethics, transparency and disclosure.

The Board continuously reviews the Company's governance, risk and compliance framework, business plans, and organization structure to align with the global standards and competitive benchmark.

Each Director informs the Company on an annual basis about the Board and Board Committee positions he/ she occupies in other companies including Chairmanships, and notifi es any changes during the term of their directorship in the Company. In addition, the Independent Directors provide a confi rmation to the effect that they meet the criteria of independence as defi ned under Indian laws. Table 1 gives

the composition of Dr. Reddy's Board, their positions, relationship with other Directors, date of joining the Board, other Directorships and memberships of Committees held by each of them.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

The Board, on the recommendations of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, considers the appointment and re-appointment of Directors.

Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013, provides that an Independent Director shall hold offi ce for a term of up to fi ve consecutive years on the Board of a Company and shall be eligible for re-appointment on passing of a special resolution by the shareholders of the Company. However, the Independent Directors shall not retire by rotation.

Accordingly, all the Independent Directors of the Company were appointed as Independent Directors under Section 149 of the Companies Act, 2013, for a term ranging from 1-5 years at the 30th Annual General Meeting. As a consequence, the term of Dr. J P Moreau

ends at the forthcoming 31st Annual General Meeting.

Section 152 of the Companies Act, 2013, states that one-third of the Board members other than Independent Directors who are subject to retire by rotation, shall retire every year and shall be eligible for re-appointment, if approved, by the shareholders at their meeting. Accordingly, at the 30th Annual General Meeting, the Company has amended the terms of appointment of Mr. G V Prasad and Mr. Satish Reddy, making them liable to retire by rotation.

In view of the above, Mr. G V Prasad, Whole-time Director, retires by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, and being eligible, seeks reappointment.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Induction of a new member on the Board of Directors is the responsibility of the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee, consisting entirely of Independent Directors. Considering the existing composition

of the Board and requirement of new domain expertise, if any, the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee reviews potential candidates. The assessment of members to the Board is based on a combination of criterion that includes ethics, personal and professional stature, domain expertise, gender diversity and specifi c qualifi cation required for the position. The potential Board member is also assessed on the basis of independence criteria defi ned in Section 149(6) of the Companies Act, 2013 and Clause 49 of the Listing Agreement. The Committee then places the details of shortlisted candidate who meet these criteria to the Board for its consideration. If the Board approves, the person is appointed as an Additional Director, subject to the approval of shareholders in the Company's general meeting.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## To the members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Standalone Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 March 2015, the statement of profit and loss and the cash flow statement for the year then ended, and a summary of the signifi cant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

## Management's Responsibility for the Standalone Financial Statements

The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act") with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Act, read with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal fi nancial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the fi nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these standalone financial statements based on our audit.

We have taken into account the provisions of the Act, the accounting and auditing standards and matters which are required to be included in the audit report under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Those Standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control relevant to the Company's preparation of the fi nancial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on whether the Company has in place an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of such controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Company's Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the fi nancial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone fi nancial statements.

## Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 March 2015 and its profit and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## a) Basis of preparation

The fi nancial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("DRL" or "the Company") have been prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India (Indian GAAP). Indian GAAP comprises Accounting Standards specifi ed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with Rule 7 of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, other pronouncements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Collectively referred to as "IGAAP"). The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees rounded off to the nearest million.

## b) Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IGAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the fi nancial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the year. Examples of such estimates include estimation of useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, valuation of inventories, assessment of recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets and cash generating units, provision for sales returns, provision for obligations relating to employees, provisions against litigations and contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

## c) Current and non current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets / liabilities include the current portion of non current assets / liabilities respectively. All other assets / liabilities are classified as non current.

## d) Tangible fi xed assets and depreciation

Fixed assets are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation. The cost of fixed assets includes non refundable taxes, duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the respective assets.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible fixed asset is capitalised only if it increases the future benefits from the existing assets beyond its previously assessed standards of performance.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the assets as estimated by the Company's management. Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of installation till the date the assets are sold or disposed. Assets acquired on finance leases and lease hold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life whichever is shorter.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of fixed assets are given below:

|                                           | Years    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                 |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings    | 20 to 30 |
| - Ancillary structures                    | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and machinery                       | 3 to 15  |
| Electrical equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Laboratory equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                                  | 4 to 5   |

Gains or losses from disposal of tangible fixed assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are differentGLYPH<nobreakspace>from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Advances paid towards acquisition of tangible fi xed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are shown under long term loans and advances. Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on the balance sheet date, is shown as capital work-in-progress.

## e) Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of those fixed assets which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by the Company in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.

## f) Intangible assets and amortisation

Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition including any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing authorities), and any directly attributable expenditure in making the asset ready for its intended use.

Intangible assets are amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for its use.

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of intangible assets are given below:

|                                                                    | Years   |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Customer contracts                                                 | 2 to 5  |
| Technical know-how                                                 | 10      |
| Product related intangibles                                        | 5 to 10 |
| Copyrights and Patents (including marketing / distribution rights) | 3 to 10 |
| Others                                                             | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year end. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from previous estimates, the amortisation period is changed accordingly.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal. Gains or losses arising from the disposal of intangible assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## g) Investments

Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be held for not more than 12 months from the date, on which such investments are made, are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as non current investments.

Current investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value. The comparison of cost and fair value is done separately in respect of each individual investment.

Non current investments are carried at cost less any other-than-temporary diminution in value, determined separately for each individual investment. The reduction in the carrying amount is reversed when there is a rise in the value of the investment or if the reasons for the reduction no longer exist. Any reduction in the carrying amount and any reversal in such reductions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss.

## h) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). Cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchase, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. The cost of all categories of inventory is determined using weighted average cost method. NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

## i) Research and development

Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized as expense in the statement of profit and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if:

- a) the product or the process is technically and commercially feasible;
- b) future economic benefits are probable and ascertainable;
- c) the Company intends to and has suffi cient resources, technical and financial, to complete development of the product and has the ability to use or sell the asset; and
- d) development costs can be measured reliably.

## j) Employee benefi ts

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The long term obligations are measured at present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations. Short term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

All actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## Other long term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Defined contribution plans

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Compensated leave of absence

The Company provides for accumulation of compensated absences by certain categories of its employees. These employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof as per Company policy. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The measurement of such obligation is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Employee stock option schemes

In accordance with the SEBI guidelines, the cost calculated based on intrinsic value method i.e., the excess of the market price of shares, at the date prior to the day of grant of options under the Employee stock option schemes, over the exercise price is treated as employee compensation and amortised over the vesting period.

## k) Foreign currency transactions and balances

Foreign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the respective transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date are reported using the foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. The resultant exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non monetary assets and liabilities are carried at the rates prevailing on the date of transaction.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of the Company's net investment in a non integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve in the Company's financial statements. Such exchange differences are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the event of disposal of the net investment.

## l) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The premium or discount on foreign exchange forward contracts is amortized as income or expense over the life of the contract. The exchange difference is calculated and recorded in accordance with AS 11 (revised) " The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" in the statement of profi t and loss. The changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts and swap contracts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as they arise. Fair value of such option and swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques considering the terms of the contract.

Pursuant to ICAI Announcement "Accounting for Derivatives" on the early adoption of AS 30 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement", the Company has adopted the Standard, to the extent that the adoption does not conflict with existing mandatory accounting standards and other authoritative pronouncements, Company law and other regulatory requirements.

## Cashfl ow hedges

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted tr ansactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified into the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, gets expired or is sold, terminated or exercised before the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, the hedge accounting on such transaction is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in hedging reserve continues to remain there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the balance in hedging reserve is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## m) Revenue recognition

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is reasonably certain, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances.

Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

## Sales returns

The Company accounts for sales returns by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates.

## Profi t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profit share which is over and above the base purchase price.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base purchase price is recognized in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the profit share component is recognized as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales of the products made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measurement of the profi t share is available.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Service Income

Service income is recognised as per the terms of contracts with customers when the related services are performed, or the agreed milestones are achieved.

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Dividend and interest income

Dividend income is recognised when the unconditional right to receive the income is established. Income from interest on deposits, loans and interest bearing securities is recognised on a time proportion basis.

## Export incentives

Export entitlements are recognised as reduction from cost of material consumed when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## n) Income tax expense

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.

## Current tax

The current charge for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the relevant tax regulations applicable to the Company.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax charge or credit reflects the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period. The deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future; however, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is a virtual certainty of realisation of such assets.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are written-down or written-up to reflect the amount that is reasonably/virtually certain (as the case may be) to be realised.

## Minimum Alternate Tax

Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credit is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specifi ed period. Such asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the carrying amount of the MAT credit asset is written down to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specifi ed period.

## o) Earnings per share

The basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the profit after tax for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, profit after tax for the year and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the period, unless they have been issued at a later date. The diluted potential equity shares have been adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e., the average market value of the outstanding shares).

## p) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## q) Impairment of assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (Cash Generating Unit or CGU) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its net selling price. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.

If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profi t and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of amortised historical cost.

## r) Leases

At the inception of the lease, a lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the lease arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an asset. A finance lease is recognized as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalized and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

## s) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment.

(d) DPCO matters

The Company is contesting various demands for payment to the credit of the Drug Prices Equalisation Account under Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1995 for few of its products, including norfloxacin. Based on its best estimate, the Company has made a provision for the potential liability related to the overcharged amount including the interest thereon and believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of penalty on this demand is not probable. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in its litigation in the Supreme Court, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and including penalties, if any, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (e) Fuel surcharge adjustment

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") has passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Company filed separate writs petitions before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh (the "High Court") challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC for various periods.

The Company, after taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, has recorded an amount of ' 215 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1GLYPH<nobreakspace>AprilGLYPH<nobreakspace>2008 to 31 MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2013 is approximately ' 473. As of 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 349 demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to addition al fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

## (f) Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Company believes that the possibility of additional liability is remote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT.

## (g) Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board ("APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specified by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board ("the APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (h) Assessable value of products supplied by a vendor to the Company

During the year ended 31 GLYPH<nobreakspace> March GLYPH<nobreakspace> 2003, the Central Excise Authorities of India ("the Central Excise Authorities") issued a demand notice to a vendor of the Company regarding the assessable value of products supplied by this vendor to the Company. The Company has been named as a co-defendant in this demand notice. The Central Excise Authorities demanded payment of ' 176 from the vendor, including penalties of ' GLYPH<nobreakspace> 90. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 70 against the Company. During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 226 from the vendor, including a penalty of ' 51. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 7 against the Company. Furthermore, during the year ended 31 March 2006, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 34. The Company filed appeals against these notices with the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the "CESTAT"). In October 2006, the CESTAT passed an order in favour of the Company setting aside all of the above demand notices. In July 2007, the Central Excise Authorities appealed against CESTAT's order in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi.

The below table shows the details of such show cause notices and the consequential actions on and status of the same.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded                                       | Status                                                                                                                         |

| October 2009 to March 2011        | '  125 plus penalties of  ' 100 and  interest thereon | The Company has filed an appeal before the CESTAT.                                                                             |
| April 2011 to March 2012          | ' 51 plus interest and penalties                      | The Company has responded to such show cause notice and is  currently awaiting a hearing with the Central Excise Commissioner. |
| April 2012 to March 2013          | ' 54 plus interest and penalties                      | The Company has responded to such show cause notice and is  currently awaiting a hearing with the Central Excise Commissioner. |
| April 2013 to March 2014          | ' 69 plus interest and penalties                      | The Company has responded to such show cause notice and is  currently awaiting a hearing with the Central Excise Commissioner. |

The Company believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of the alleged inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable.

## (j) Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

The Company received various show cause notices from the Government of Telangana's Commercial Taxes Department objecting to the Company's methodology of calculation of VAT input credit. The below table shows the details of each of such show cause notices and the consequential actions on and status of the same.

| Period covered under the notice   | Amount demanded        | Status                                                                     |
|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| April 2006 to March 2009          | '  66 plus 10% penalty | The Company has filed an appeal before the Sales Tax Appellate  Tribunal.  |
| April 2009 to March 2011          | '  59 plus 10% penalty | The Company has filed an appeal before the Sales Tax Appellate  Tribunal.  |
| April 2011 to March 2013          | '  86 plus 10% penalty | The Company has filed an appeal before the Appellate Deputy  Commissioner. |

The Company believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of the allegedly inappropriate claims to VAT credits is not probable.

Additionally, the Company is in receipt of various show cause notices from the Indian Sales Tax authorities. The disputed amount is ' 43. The Company has responded to such show cause notices and believes that the chances of any liability arising from such notices are less than probable. Accordingly, no provision is made in the Company's financial statements as at 31 March 2015.

## (k) Direct tax matter

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Indian Income Tax authorities disallowed for tax purposes certain business transactions entered into by the parent company with its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The associated tax impact is ' 570. The Company believes that such business transactions are allowed for tax deduction under Indian Income Tax laws and has accordingly filed an appeal with the Income Tax Appellate Authorities. The Company further believes that the probability of succeeding in this matter is more likely than not and therefore no provision was made in the Company' s fi nancial statements as of 31 March 2015.

Additionally, the Company is contesting various other disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact is ' 611. The Company believes that the chances of an unfavorable outcome in each of such disallowances are less than probable and accordingly, no provision is made in the Company's financial statements as of 31 March 2015.

- (l) Additionally, the Company is involved in other disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Except as discussed above, the Company does not believe that there are any such contingent liabilities that are expected to have any material adverse effect on its fi nancial statements.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.30: EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME

Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan-2002 ("the DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002GLYPH<nobreakspace>Plan for all eligible employees in pursuance of the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24GLYPH<nobreakspace>SeptemberGLYPH<nobreakspace>2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees of DRL and its subsidiaries and directors (excluding promoter directors) of DRL and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Under the Scheme, the Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board ('the Committee') shall administer the Scheme and grant stock options to eligible directors and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Committee shall determine the employees eligible for receiving the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for the options issued on the date of the grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of fi ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>5 per option).

The fair market value of a share on each grant date falling under Category A above is defined as the average closing price (after adjustment of Bonus issue) for 30 days prior to the grant, in the stock exchange where there was highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after getting the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the issue of bonus shares by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock options granted in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------|

| Balance of shares that can be allotted on exercise of options (B) | 205,939                               | 1,847,685                             | 2,053,624 |
| Options arising from issue of bonus shares (C)                    | 205,939                               | 1,847,685                             | 2,053,624 |
| Total options after bonus shares (A+B+C)                          | 505,939                               | 3,843,163                             | 4,349,102 |

In the case of termination of employment, all unvested options would stand cancelled. Options that have vested but have not been exercised can be exercised within the time prescribed under each option agreement by the Committee or if no time limit is prescribed, within three months of the date of employment termination, failing which they would stand cancelled.

The term of the DRL 2002 Plan was extended for a period of 10 years with effect from 29 January 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company has issued 230,840 Category B options to eligible employees under the DRL 2002 Plan. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

The date of grant, number of options granted, exercise price fixed by the Committee for respective options and the market price of the shares of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant are given below:

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.35: HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Russian roubles and Euros, and foreign currency debt in U.S. dollars, Russian roubles and Euros.

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Further, the Company also uses non derivative financial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy.

In respect of the aforesaid foreign exchange derivative contracts, the Company has recorded, as part of foreign exchange gains and losses, a net gain of ' 1,040 and a net loss of ' 297 for the years ended 31 March 2015 and 2014, respectively.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

In respect of the aforesaid hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions, the Company has recorded, in reserves and surplus, a net gain of ' 51 and a net loss of ' 407 for the years ended 31 March 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company also recorded, as part of revenue, a net gain of ' 810 and a net loss of ' 946 during the years ended 31 March 2015 and 2014, respectively.

The net carrying amount of the Company's "hedging reserve" was a gain of ' 46 as at 31 March 2015, as compared to a loss of ' 5 as at 31 March 2014.

The table below summarises the periods when the forecasted cash flows associated with hedging instruments that are classified as cash flow hedges, are expected to occur:

## 2.36: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee are responsible for overseeing Company's financial risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.

## Trade receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. As at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, the maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables is ' 47,117 and ' 45,615, respectively (net of allowances).

Trade receivables include foreign currency receivables of USD 37 million (amounting to ' 2,333) from Dr. Reddy's Venezuela, C.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in Venezuela. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Venezuelan economy was adversely impacted by a signifi cant decline in crude oil prices, leading to higher inflation rates and significantly delayed approvals for import payments. Further, Venezuelan government has introduced multi-tiered exchange rate system for different category of imports.

As of 31 March 2015, the exchange rates in all the three aforesaid tiers are as follows:

- · CENCOEX preferential rate - 6.3 VEF per USD;
- · SICAD rate - 12 VEF per USD; and
- · SIMADI rate - approximately 193 VEF per USD.

As per the existing laws in Venezuela, payments towards the importation of pharmaceutical products qualify for the CENCOEX preferential rate of 6.3 VEF per USD, and the Company's Venezuelan subsidiary has been receiving approvals at such preferential rate. Accordingly, no provision for bad and doubtful debts is recorded during the year ended 31 March 2015 in respect of these outstanding trade receivables.

## Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired

Trade receivables amounting to ' 28,687 and ' 30,673 were neither past due nor impaired as at 31 MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015 and 31 March 2014 respectively.

## Trade receivables that are past due but not impaired

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The age analysis of the trade receivables has been considered from the due date of the invoice. The ageing of trade receivables that are past due but not impaired is given below:

| PERIOD (IN DAYS)   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2015   | AS AT  31 MARCH 2014   |

## Financial guarantees

Financial guarantees disclosed in Note 2.25 have been provided as corporate guarantees to financial institutions and banks that have extended credits and other financial assistance to the Company's subsidiaries. In this regard, the Company does not foresee any significant credit risk exposure.

## c. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from a change in the price of a fi nancial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk-sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive fi nancial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Roubles and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in U.S. dollars, Euros and Roubles). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's financial performance gets adversely impacted. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding derivative contracts are given in Note 2.35 above.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,308/(631) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 1,460/ (1,604) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2015.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,254/(945) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 2,745/ (2,892) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2014.

For the year ended 31 March 2015 and 2014, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies in the above mentioned financial assets/liabilities would affect the Company's net profit by approximately ' 664 and ' 1,492 respectively, from such fi nancial assets/liabilities.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2015, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 26,366 carrying a fl oating interest rate of LIBOR plus 7.5 - 125 bps whereas as of 31 March 2014, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 17,219 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 20-179 bps and ' 846 carrying a fl oating interest rate of Moscow Prime Offered Rate plus 60 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates.

An increase or decrease of 10%GLYPH<nobreakspace>in the floating interest rate component applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by approximatelyGLYPH<nobreakspace> ' GLYPH<nobreakspace> 4 andGLYPH<nobreakspace> ' GLYPH<nobreakspace> 10 for the year ended 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015 and 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2014, respectively.

The Company's investments in fixed deposits with banks and short term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## 2.36: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients.These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate signifi cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. The Company has historically not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

The Board of Directors of the Company are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

## Auditors' Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and the disclosures in the consolidated fi nancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated fi nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal financial control relevant to the Holding Company's preparation of the consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on whether the Holding Company has in place an adequate internal fi nancial controls system over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of such controls. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of the accounting estimates made by the Holding Company's Board of Directors, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated fi nancial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in Other Matters paragraph below, is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated fi nancial statements.

## Opinion

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid consolidated financial statements give the information required by the Act in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the Company, as at 31 March 2015, and their consolidated profi t and their consolidated cash fl ows for the year ended on that date.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## NOTE 1: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## a) Basis of preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements

The consolidated financial statements h ave been prepared and presented in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India ("Indian GAAP"). Indian GAAP comprises Accounting Standards specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013, read with Rule 7 of Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014, other pronouncements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, the relevant provisions of the Companies Act, 2013 and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) (Collectively referred to as "IGAAP"). The fi nancial statements are presented in Indian Rupees rounded off to the nearest million.

## b) Use of estimates

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with IGAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the fi nancial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the year. Examples of such estimates include estimation of useful lives of tangible and intangible assets, valuation of inventories, assessment of recoverable amounts of deferred tax assets and cash generating units, provision for sales returns, rebates and chargebacks, provision for obligations relating to employees, provisions against litigations and contingencies. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Any revision to accounting estimates is recognised prospectively in the current and future periods.

## c) Current and non current classifi cation

All the assets and liabilities have been classifi ed as current or non current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013.

## Assets:

An asset is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities:

A liability is classified as current when it satisfies any of the following criteria:

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classifi cation.

Current assets/ liabilities include the current portion of non current assets/ liabilities respectively. All other assets/ liabilities are classified as non current.

## d) Principles of consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("DRL" or the "parent company"), and all of its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "the Company" or "the Group"), in which the parent company has more than one-half of the voting power of an enterprise or where the parent company controls the composition of the board of directors. In accordance with AS 27 - "Financial Reporting of Interests in Joint Ventures", the Company has accounted for its proportionate share of interest in joint venture by the proportionate consolidation method. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the following basis:

- · The fi nancial statements of the parent company and the subsidiaries have been combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after eliminating intra-group balances / transactions and resulting unrealised profi ts in full. Unrealised losses resulting from intra-group transactions have also been eliminated except to the extent that recoverable value of related assets is lower than their cost to the Company. The amounts shown in respect of reserves comprise the amount of the relevant reserves as per the balance sheet of the parent company and its share in the post-acquisition increase in the relevant reserves of the subsidiaries.
- · The proportionate share of Company's interest in Joint Ventures is combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses after eliminating intra-group transactions and resulting unrealised profits, to the extent it pertains to the Company.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

- · The excess / defi cit of cost to the parent company of its investment in the subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates over its portion of equity at the respective dates on which investment in such entities were made is recognised in the financial statements as goodwill / capital reserve.
- · The consolidated financial statements are presented, to the extent possible, in the same format as that adopted by the parent company for its separate fi nancial statements.

## e) Tangible fi xed assets and depreciation

Tangible fi xed assets are carried at the cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation. The cost of tangible fixed assets includes non-refundable taxes, duties, freight and other incidental expenses related to the acquisition and installation of the respective assets.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Subsequent expenditure related to an item of tangible fixed asset is capitalised only if it increases the future benefits from the existing assets beyond its previously assessed standards of performance.

Depreciation on tangible fixed assets is provided using the straight-line method based on the useful life of the assets as estimated by Management. Depreciation is calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of installation till the date the assets are sold or disposed.

Assets acquired on finance leases and leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease agreement or the useful life whichever is shorter. Land is not depreciated.

The Management's estimates of the useful lives for various categories of fixed assets are given below:

|                                           | Years    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                                 |          |
| Factory and administrative buildings      | 20 to 50 |
| Ancillary structures                      | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and machinery                       | 3 to 15  |
| Electrical equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Laboratory equipment                      | 5 to 15  |
| Furniture, fixtures and offi ce equipment | 3 to 10  |
| Vehicles                                  | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are different from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

Gains or losses from disposal of tangible fixed assets are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Advances paid towards acquisition of tangible fi xed assets outstanding at each balance sheet date are shown under long-term loans and advances. Cost of assets not ready for intended use, as on the balance sheet date, is shown as capital work-in-progress.

## f) Borrowing costs

General and specific borrowing costs directly attributable to acquisition or construction of those fixed assets which necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use are capitalised. Borrowing costs are interest and other costs incurred by the Company in connection with the borrowing of funds. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they are incurred.

## g) Intangible assets and amortisation

Intangible assets are recorded at the consideration paid for acquisition including any import duties and other taxes (other than those subsequently recoverable by the enterprise from the taxing authorities), and any directly attributable expenditure on making the asset ready for its intended use.

Intangible assets are amortised on a systematic basis over the best estimate of their useful lives, commencing from the date the asset is available to the Company for its use.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The Management's estimates for useful lives of various categories of intangible assets are as follows:

|                                                                      | Years   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Goodwill                                                             | 5 to 20 |
| Customer related intangibles                                         | 2 to 11 |
| Patents, trademarks, etc. (including marketing/ distribution rights) | 3 to 16 |
| Technology related intangibles                                       | 3 to 13 |
| Product related intangibles                                          | 5 to 15 |
| Others                                                               | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets are reviewed at each fi nancial year-end. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from previous estimates, the amortisation period is changed accordingly.

An intangible asset is derecognised on disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use and disposal. Gains or losses arising from the disposal of intangible asset are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

## h) Investments

Investments that are readily realisable and are intended to be held for not more than one year from the date on which such investments are made are classified as current investments. All other investments are classified as non current investments. Current investments are carried at the lower of cost and fair value. The comparison of cost and fair value is done separately in respect of each individual investment.

Non current investments are carried at cost less any other-than-temporary diminution in value, determined separately for each individual investment. The reduction in the carrying amount is reversed when there is a rise in the value of the investment or if the reasons for the reduction no longer exist. Any reduction in the carrying amount and any reversal in such reductions are charged or credited to the statement of profit and loss.

## i) Inventories

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). Cost of inventories comprises all cost of purchase, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. The cost of all categories of inventory is determined using weighted average cost method. NRV is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of the business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

## j) Research and development

Expenditure on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding is recognized in the statement of profit and loss when incurred.

Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes. Development expenditure is capitalized only if:

- a. the product or the process is technically and commercially feasible;
- b. future economic benefits are probable and ascertainable;
- c. the Company intends to and has suffi cient resources to complete development of the product and has the ability to use or sell the asset; and
- d. development costs can be measured reliably.

## k) Employee benefi ts

## Defi ned benefi t plans

The liability in respect of defi ned benefit plans and other post-employment benefits is calculated using the projected unit credit method and spread over the period during which the benefit is expected to be derived from employees' services, consistent with the advice of qualifi ed actuaries. The long term obligations are measured at present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at rates reflecting the yields on risk free government bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Company's obligations. Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided.

All actuarial gains and losses arising during the year are recognized in the statement of profit and loss.

## Other long term employee benefi ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long term employee benefits is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Defined contribution plan

The Company's contributions to defined contribution plans are recognized in the statement of profit and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## Termination benefi ts

Termination benefits are recognized as an expense when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination benefits for voluntary redundancies are recognized as an expense if the Company has made an offer encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the offer will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Compensated leave of absence

The Company provides for accumulation of compensated absences by certain categories of its employees. These employees can carry forward a portion of the unutilized compensated absences and utilize it in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof as per Company policy. The Company records an obligation for compensated absences in the period in which the employee renders the services that increases this entitlement. The measurement of such obligation is based on actuarial valuation as at the balance sheet date carried out by a qualifi ed actuary.

## Employee stock option schemes

In accordance with the SEBI guidelines, the cost calculated based on intrinsic value method i.e. the excess of the market price of shares, at the date prior to the day of grant of options under the Employee stock option schemes, over the exercise price is treated as employee compensation and amortised over the vesting period.

## l) Foreign currency transactions, balances and translation of financial statements of foreign operations

## Foreign currency transactions

Foreign currency transactions are recorded using the exchange rates prevailing on the dates of the respective transactions. Exchange differences arising on foreign currency transactions settled during the year are recognised in the statement of profit and loss.

Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date are reported using the foreign exchange rates as at the balance sheet date. The resultant exchange differences are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried at the rates prevailing on the date of transaction.

Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that, in substance, forms part of Company's net investment in a non-integral foreign operation are accumulated in a foreign currency translation reserve in the Company's financial statements. Such exchange differences are recognized in the statement of profit and loss in the event of disposal of the net investment.

## Foreign operations

The fi nancial statements of the foreign integral subsidiaries, representative offi ces and branches collectively referred to as the 'foreign integral operations' are translated into Indian rupees as follows:

- · Items of income and expenditure are translated at the respective monthly average rates;
- · Monetary items are translated using the closing rate;
- · Non-monetary items are translated using the monthly average rate which is expected to approximate the actual rate on the date of transaction; and
- · The net exchange difference resulting from the translation of items in the financial statements of foreign integral operations is recognised in the statement of profit and loss as foreign exchange gain/loss.
- In the circumstances where there are several exchange rates available within a country, or where the closing exchange rate does not refl ect the amount that is likely to be realized, then the relevant monetary items are translated using a rate that best represents the amount which is likely to be realized from, or required to disburse, such item at the balance sheet date.

The fi nancial statements of non-integral foreign operations are translated into Indian rupees as follows:

- · All assets and liabilities, both monetary and non-monetary, are translated using the closing rate;
- · Items of income and expenditure are translated at the respective monthly average rates; and
- · The resulting net exchange difference are recognized in foreign currency translation reserve account forming part of Company's reserves and surplus.

## m) Derivative instruments and hedge accounting

The Company uses forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts (derivatives) to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company does not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The premium or discount on foreign exchange forward contracts is amortized as income or expense over the life of the contract. The exchange difference is calculated and recorded in accordance with ASGLYPH<nobreakspace>11 (revised), "The Effect of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates" in the statement of profi t and loss. The changes in the fair value of foreign currency option contracts and swap contracts are recognised in the statement of profi t and loss as they arise. Fair value of such option contracts and swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques considering the terms of the contract.

Pursuant to the ICAI Announcement "Accounting for Derivatives" on the early adoption of AS 30 "Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement", the Company has adopted the Standard, to the extent that the adoption does not conflict with existing mandatory accounting standards and other authoritative pronouncements, the Companies Act, 2013 and other regulatory requirements.

## Cash fl ow hedges

The Company classifies its derivative contracts that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted tr ansactions as cash fl ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The effective portion of such cash flow hedges is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified into the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ineffective portion is immediately recorded in the statement of profit and loss.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative financial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for the hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions and, accordingly, applies cash flow hedge accounting for such relationships. Re-measurement gain/loss on such non-derivative financial liabilities is recorded as part of reserves and surplus within the Company's "hedging reserve", and re-classified in the statement of profit and loss as revenue in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, gets expired or is sold, terminated or exercised before the occurrence of the forecasted transaction, the hedge accounting on such transaction is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in hedging reserve continues to remain there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the balance in hedging reserve is recognized immediately in the statement of profit and loss.

## n) Revenue recognition

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, recovery of the consideration is reasonably certain, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.

Revenue from the sale of goods includes excise duty and is net of returns, sales tax and applicable trade discounts and allowances.

Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Accrual for chargeback, rebates, discounts and medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the difference between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Accrual for such chargeback is made considering the factors such as historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers / other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Sales returns

The Company accounts for sales returns by recording an allowance for sales returns concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This allowance is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates.

## Profi t share revenues

From time to time the Company enters into various marketing arrangements with its business partners for the sale of its products. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a profi t share which is over and above the agreed price. Revenue in an amount equal to the agreed price is recognized on these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. The additional amount representing the profit share component is recognized as revenue in the period which corresponds to the ultimate sales made by business partners only when the collectability of the profit share becomes probable and a reliable measure of the profit share is available.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Milestone payments and out licensing arrangements

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. Non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognized over the period in which the Company has continuing performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognized as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, if the milestones are considered substantive, or over the period the Company has continuing performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

## Service Income

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognized in the statement of profit and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fee

The Company enters into certain dossier sales, licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Income from licensing arrangements is generally recognised over the term of the contract. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## Dividend and interest income

Dividend income is recognised when the unconditional right to receive the income is established. Income from interest on deposits, loans and interest bearing securities is recognised on a time proportion basis.

## Export incentives

Export incentives are recognised as reduction from cost of material consumed when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made and where there is no significant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## o) Income tax expense

Income tax expense comprises current tax and deferred tax charge or credit. Total tax expense is the aggregate of the amounts of tax expense appearing in the separate financial statements of the parent company and its subsidiaries. Accordingly, tax expense is not adjusted for consolidation adjustments such as elimination of unrealized intra-group profi ts.

## Current tax

The current charge for income taxes is calculated in accordance with the relevant tax regulations applicable to the entities in the Company.

## Deferred tax

Deferred tax charge or credit reflects the tax effects of timing differences between accounting income and taxable income for the period. The deferred tax charge or credit and the corresponding deferred tax liabilities or assets are recognised using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be realised in future; however, where there is unabsorbed depreciation or carry forward of losses, deferred tax assets are recognised only if there is a virtual certainty of realisation of such assets.

Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are written-down or written-up to reflect the amount that is reasonably/virtually certain (as the case may be) to be realised.

## Minimum Alternate Tax

Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credit is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specifi ed period. Such asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and the carrying amount of the MAT credit asset is written down to the extent there is no longer convincing evidence to the effect that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specifi ed period.

## Offsetting

Current tax assets and current tax liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Company has a legally enforceable right to set-off assets against liabilities representing current tax, and where such deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes on income levied by the same governing taxation laws.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## p) Earnings per share

The basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing the net profit after tax for the year by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net profit after tax for the year and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential equity shares. The dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as of the beginning of the year, unless they have been issued at a later date. The diluted potential equity shares have been adjusted for the proceeds receivable had the shares been actually issued at fair value (i.e. the average market value of the outstanding shares).

## q) Impairment of assets

The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.

For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets (Cash Generating Unit or CGU) that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or CGUs.

The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its net selling price. Value in use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life.

If such recoverable amount of the asset or the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its recoverable amount. The reduction is treated as an impairment loss and is recognised in the statement of profit and loss. If at the balance sheet date there is an indication that if a previously assessed impairment loss no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is reflected at the recoverable amount subject to a maximum of amortised historical cost.

## r) Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A provision is recognised when the Company has a present obligation as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.

## Onerous contracts

A contract is considered as onerous when the expected economic benefits to be derived by the Company from the contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision for an onerous contract is measured at the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. Where there is possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made. Contingent assets are not recognised in the financial statements. However, contingent assets are assessed continually and if it is virtually certain that an inflow of economic benefits will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## s) Government grants

The Company recognizes government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction from the carrying amount of the related asset. Revenue Grants are deducted in reporting the related expense.

## t) Leases

At the inception of the lease, a lease arrangement is classified as either a finance lease or an operating lease, based on the substance of the arrangement.

## Finance leases

A fi nance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incident to ownership of an asset. A finance lease is recognized as an asset and a liability at the commencement of the lease, at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Initial direct costs, if any, are also capitalized and, subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset. Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

## Operating leases

Other leases are operating leases, and the leased assets are not recognized on the Company's balance sheet. Payments made under operating leases are recognized in the statement of profit and loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.

## u) Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignifi cant risk of changes in value. For this purpose, "short-term" means investments having maturity of three months or less from the date of investment.

## (d) DPCO matters

The Company is contesting various demands for payment to the credit of the Drug Prices Equalisation Account under Drugs (Price Control) Order, 1995 for few of its products, including norfloxacin. Based on its best estimate, the Company has made a provision for the potential liability related to the overcharged amount including the interest thereon and believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of penalty on this demand is not probable. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in its litigation in the Supreme Court, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the notified selling prices to the Government of India with interest and including penalties, if any, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## (e) Ibandronate Sodium litigation

In June 2012, the Company launched its ibandronate sodium 150 mg tablet product, a generic version of Boniva® tablets, which are marketed and distributed by Genentech USA, Inc., a member of the Roche Group.The Company is defending patent infringement actions brought by Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. and Genentech USA, Inc. (collectively, "Roche") in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey with respect to this product. These actions were first commenced in September 2007 and over time expanded to assert infringement of four patents - one formulation patent (U.S. patent number 6,294,196) and three method of use patents (numbers 7,192,938, 7,410,957 and 7,718,634). Claims regarding U.S. patent numbers 6,294,196 and 7,192,938 were dismissed in December 2008 and April 2010, respectively.

On 7 May 2012, the Court granted the Company's motion for summary judgment that U.S. patent number 7,718,634 was invalid based on obviousness. In June 2012, the Company launched its ibandronate sodium 150 mg tablet product. On 1 October 2012, the Court granted summary judgment in the Company's favor finding U.S. patent number 7,410,957 invalid.

On 15 November 2012, the Court issued a fi nal judgment in favor of the Company. Roche fi led a motion for reconsideration on 16 November 2012 which was denied by the Court on 25 January 2013. Roche has appealed both of the Court's summary judgment decisions. Argument of the appeal was heard on 6 December 2013, and on 11 April 2014, the Court of Appeals affi rmed that the U.S. patent numbers 7,718,634 and 7,410,957 are invalid as obvious. A petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc was filed by Roche on 12GLYPH<nobreakspace>MayGLYPH<nobreakspace>2014, and the Company filed its response on 9 June 2014. On 11 July 2014, the Court denied the petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc.

## (f) Nexium litigations

Five federal antitrust class action lawsuits have been brought on behalf of direct purchasers of Nexium, and ten federal class action lawsuits have been brought under both state and federal law on behalf of end-payors of Nexium. These actions have been fi led against various generic manufacturers, including the Company and its U.S. subsidiary Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc. These actions have been consolidated in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The complaints allege that, beginning in 2005, AstraZeneca sued various generic manufacturers, including the Company, for infringement with respect to patents purporting to cover AstraZeneca's branded drug, Nexium.

Plaintiffs allege that AstraZeneca's settlement agreements with these various generic manufacturers, including the Company, violated federal and state antitrust laws, as well as state unfair competition laws. The complaints seek unspecified damages for class members as a result of an alleged delay in the entry of generic versions of Nexium.

The Company believes that each of these complaints lacks merit and that the Company's conduct complied with all applicable laws and regulations. All of the defendants, including the Company, filed motions to dismiss the complaints, which motions were denied in April 2013. T he defendants also fi led motions for summary judgment. Arguments regarding these motions were heard on 21 January 2014.

On 12 February 2014, the Court issued an order granting the Company's motion in part, finding that the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the Company's settlement of patent litigation with AstraZeneca included a large and unjustified reverse payment. On 20 October 2014, the Company reached a settlement with a majority of the plaintiffs, subject to the Court's approval. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company will not make any payment to the plaintiffs. On 28 January 2015, the Court granted the Company's consent motion for approval of the settlement agreements.

In addition, two complaints, similar in nature to those referenced above, were filed in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania by plaintiffs who chose to opt out of the class action lawsuit. No dispositive motions have been filed in these actions.

## 2.27: CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

## (g) Reclast and Zometa litigation

In January 2013, Novartis AG ("Novartis") brought patent infringement actions against the Company and a number of other generic companies in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. Novartis asserted that the Company's ANDA for Reclast® would infringe Novartis' U.S. Patent No. 8,052,987 and that the Company's ANDA for Zometa® would infringe Novartis' U.S. Patent No. 8,324,189. In February 2013, Novartis sought a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Company and the other generic defendants from launching their generic Reclast® and Zometa® products. On 1 March 2013, the Court denied Novartis' motion for a temporary restraining order.

Later in March 2013, the Company launched its generic version of Novartis' Zometa® Injection (zoledronic acid, 4 mg/5mL product) and in April 2013, the Company launched its generic version of Novartis' Reclast® Injection (zoledronic acid, 5 mg/100mL product). After the Company launched its products, Novartis withdrew its application for a preliminary injunction. The Company believes that the asserted patents are either invalid or not infringed by the Company's products. The Court has construed the patent claims and the case is currently in progress at a fact discovery stage. No provision is made in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2015. If Novartis is ultimately successful in its patent infringement case, the Company could be required to pay damages related to the sale of its generic Reclast® and Zometa® products.

## (h) Child resistant packaging matter

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") requested that Dr.GLYPH<nobreakspace>Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information.

The CPSC subsequently alleged, in a letter dated 30 April 2014, that the Company has violated the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and intends to seek civil penalties. Simultaneously, the Department of Justice (DOJ) is also currently investigating a complaint related to these issues under the Federal False Claims Act. A meeting with the DOJ occurred on 20 August 2014 and the Company has provided some additional clarifying information to the DOJ subsequent to that meeting.

At this stage of the proceedings, the Company cannot conclude that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is either probable or remote. Accordingly, no provision is made in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of 31 March 2015. An unfavorable outcome in these matters could result in significant liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

## (i) Land pollution, India

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action filed a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollarum areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollarum and Jeedimetla areas for discharging effl uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was fi xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Company believes that the possibility of additional liability is remote. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT.

## (j) Water pollution and air pollution, India

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, alongwith 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board ("APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities specified by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board").The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-finding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions). The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners in the National Green Tribunal and the matter is currently pending before it.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a notification in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the National Green Tribunal. Importantly, the notifi cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index issued a notifi cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This notification overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government notification that conditionally permitted expansion.

## (k) Fuel surcharge adjustment

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") has passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The Company filed separate writ petitions before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh (the "High Court") challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC for various periods.

The Company, after taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, has recorded an amount of ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1GLYPH<nobreakspace>AprilGLYPH<nobreakspace>2008 to 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2013 is approximately ' 482. As of 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to addition al fi nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

## (l) Assessable value of products supplied by a vendor to the Company

During the year ended 31 March 2003, the Central Excise Authorities of India ("the Central Excise Authorities") issued a demand notice to a vendor of the Company regarding the assessable value of products supplied by this vendor to the Company. The Company has been named as a co-defendant in this demand notice. The Central Excise Authorities demanded payment of ' 176 from the vendor, including penalties of ' 90. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 70 against the Company. During the year ended 31 March 2005, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 226 from the vendor, including a penalty of ' 51. Through the same notice, the Central Excise Authorities issued a penalty claim of ' 7 against the Company. Furthermore, during the year ended 31 March 2006, the Central Excise Authorities issued an additional notice to this vendor demanding ' 34. The Company filed appeals against these notices with the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal (the "CESTAT"). In October 2006, the CESTAT passed an order in favour of the Company setting aside all of the above demand notices. In July 2007, the Central Excise Authorities appealed against CESTAT's order in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi. The matter is pending in the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi.

## (m) Distribution of input service tax credits

The Central Excise Authorities have issued various show cause notices to the Company objecting to the Company's methodology of distributing input service tax credits claimed for one of the Company's facilities. The below table shows the details of each of such show cause notices and the consequential actions on and status of the same.

| October 2009 to March 2011        | '  125 plus penalties of  '  100 and  interest thereon | The Company has filed an appeal before the CESTAT.                                                                             |

The Company believes that the possibility of any liability that may arise on account of the alleged inappropriate distribution of input service tax credits is not probable.

## (n) Value Added Tax ("VAT") matter

## 2.31: SEGMENT REPORTING

The primary and secondary reportable segments are business and geographic segments, respectively.

## Business segments:

The Company is organised on a worldwide basis into the following businesses which are reportable segments:

- GLYPH<square4> Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI");
- GLYPH<square4> Global Generics; and
- GLYPH<square4> Proprietary Products.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients: This segment includes active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as active pharmaceutical products or bulk drugs, which are the principal ingredients for finished pharmaceutical products. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates become finished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are fixed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. This segment also includes contract research services and the manufacture and sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients and steroids in accordance with the specific customer requirements.

Global Generics: This segment consists of finished pharmaceutical products ready for consumption/ use by the patient, marketed under a brand name (branded formulations) or as generic finished dosages with therapeutic equivalence to branded formulations (generics). This segment includes the operations of the Company's biologics business.

Proprietary Products: This segment consists of the Company's differentiated formulations business, New Chemical Entities ("NCEs") business, and the dermatology focused specialty business operated through Promius™ Pharma.

Others: This includes the operations of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary,Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited, a discovery stage biotechnology company developing novel and best-in-class therapies in the fields of oncology and inflammation and which works with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in early-stage collaborations, bringing drug candidates from hit generation through Investigational New Drug ("IND") fi ling.

## Geographic segments:

The Company's business is organised into five key geographic segments viz. India, North America, Russia and other CIS countries, Europe and Others. Revenues are attributable to individual geographic segments based on the location of the customer.

Segment revenues and expenses: All segment revenues and expenses are directly attributable to the segments.

Segment assets and liabilities: As certain assets of the Company including manufacturing facilities, development facilities, and treasury assets and liabilities are often deployed interchangeably across business segments, it is impractical to allocate these assets and liabilities to each business segment.

Inter-segment transfers: Segment revenue, segment expenses and segment result include transfers between business segments. Inter-segment transfers are accounted for at cost to the transferring segment. Such transfers are eliminated on consolidation.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 2.32: EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION SCHEME (CONTINUED)

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at Annual General Meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27GLYPH<nobreakspace>JulyGLYPH<nobreakspace>2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 reserved for grant of options having exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>5 per option).

The fair market value of a share on each grant date falling under Category A above is defined as the average closing price (after adjustment of Bonus issue) for 30 days prior to the grant, in the stock exchange where there was highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after getting the approval of the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the issue of bonus shares by the Company in August 2006, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock options granted in the above two categories as follows:

| PARTICULARS                                                       | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY A   | NUMBER OF OPTIONS  UNDER CATEGORY B   | TOTAL     |

In the case of termination of employment, all unvested options would stand cancelled. Options that have vested but have not been exercised can be exercised within the time prescribed under each option agreement by the Committee or if no time limit is prescribed, within three months of the date of employment termination, failing which they would stand cancelled.

The term of the DRL 2002 Plan was extended for a period of 10 years with effect from 29 January 2012 by the shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 20 July 2012.

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company has issued 230,840 Category B options to eligible employees under the DRL 2002 Plan. The vesting period for the options granted varies from 12 to 48 months.

The date of grant, number of options granted, exercise price fixed by the Committee for respective options and the market price of the shares of the Company on the day prior to the date of grant are given below:

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest rates.GLYPH<nobreakspace> The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.GLYPH<nobreakspace>

The changes in fair value of such interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognized as part of fi nance cost. Accordingly, the Company has recorded, as part of finance cost, a net loss of ' 10 and a net gain of ' 259 for the years ended 31 March 2015 and 2014, respectively.

## 2.37: FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimize potential adverse effects of market risk on its fi nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.

## Trade receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country, in which the customer operates, also has an influence on credit risk assessment. As at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, the maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to trade receivables is ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>41,012 and ' 33,253 respectively (net of allowances).

## Trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired

Trade receivables amounting to ' 33,473 and ' 24,422 were neither past due nor impaired as at 31 March 2015 and 31 March 2014, respectively.

## Trade receivables that are past due but not impaired

The Company's credit period for customers generally ranges from 20 - 180 days. The age analysis of the trade receivables has been considered from the due date of the invoice. The ageing of trade receivables that are past due, but not impaired, is given below:

## b. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2015 and 2014, the Company had unutilized credit limits from banks of ' 10,619 and ' 14,596, respectively.

As at 31 March 2015, the Company had working capital (i.e. current assets less current liabilities) of ' 50,554 including cash and bank balances of ' 18,724 and current investments of ' 21,022. As at 31 March 2014, the Company had working capital of ' 45,354 including cash and bank balances of ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>23,006 and current investments of ' 10,664.

## c. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings or fair values or future cash fl ows that may result from a change in the price of a fi nancial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other market changes that affect market risk-sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive fi nancial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables and long term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in U.S. dollars, British pounds sterling, Roubles, Venezuelan bolivars and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in U.S. dollars, Euros and Roubles). A significant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a significant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's financial performance may get adversely impacted. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses derivative fi nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecasted transactions and recognized assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding derivative contracts are given in Note 2.36 above.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease / increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,308 / (631) increase / (decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 1,601 / (1,791) increase / (decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2015.

In respect of the Company's derivative contracts, a 10% decrease / increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in an approximately ' 1,254 / (945) increase / (decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and an approximately ' 3,856 / (4,004) increase / (decrease) in the Company's net profit as at 31 March 2014.

For the year ended 31 March 2015 and 2014, every 10% depreciation / appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies in the above mentioned fi nancial assets / liabilities would affect the Company's net profi t by approximately ' 1,173 and ' 1,606, respectively, from such financial assets / liabilities.

Further, the Company is exposed to a potential adverse devaluation risk on its monetary assets of VEF 245 million in Venezuela, which are currently recorded at the CENCOEX preferential rate of VEF 6.3 per U.S. dollar. Refer to Note 2.43 for further details.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2015, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 37,419 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 7.5 -130 bps whereas as of 31 March 2014, the Company had foreign currency loans of ' 34,375 carrying a floating interest rate of LIBOR plus 20 - 179 bps and ' 846 carrying a fl oating interest rate of Moscow Prime Offered Rate plus 60 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary. An increase or decrease of 10% in the floating interest rate component applicable to its loans and borrowings would affect the Company's net profit by approximately ' 6 and ' GLYPH<nobreakspace>13 for the years ended 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2015 and 31GLYPH<nobreakspace>MarchGLYPH<nobreakspace>2014, respectively.

The Company's investments in term deposits with banks and short term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to significant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients.These are commodity products, whose prices may fl uctuate signifi cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally fluctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. The Company has historically not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices.

## 2.42: COLLABORATION AGREEMENT WITH CURIS, INC.

On 18 January 2015, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited ("Aurigene"), a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company, entered into a Collaboration, License and Option Agreement (the "Collaboration Agreement") with Curis, Inc. ("Curis") to discover, develop and commercialize small molecule antagonists for immuno-oncology and precision oncology targets.

Under the Collaboration Agreement, Aurigene has the responsibility for conducting all discovery and preclinical activities, including Investigational New Drug ("IND") enabling studies and providing Phase 1 clinical trial supply, and Curis is responsible for all clinical development, regulatory and commercialization efforts worldwide, excluding India and Russia. The Collaboration Agreement provides that the parties will collaborate exclusively in immuno-oncology for an initial period of approximately two years, with the option for Curis to extend the broad immuno-oncology exclusivity.

As a partial consideration for the collaboration, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated 18 January 2015, Curis issued to Aurigene approximately 17.1 million shares of its common stock, representing 19.9% of its outstanding common stock immediately prior to the transaction and approximately 16.6% of its outstanding common stock immediately after the transaction. The shares issued to Aurigene are subject to a lock-up agreement until 18 January 2017, with the shares being released from such lock-up in 25% increments on each of 18 July 2015, 18 January 2016, 18 July 2016 and 18 January 2017, subject to acceleration of release of all the shares in connection with a change of control of Curis. In connection with the issuance of such shares, Curis and Aurigene entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated 18 January 2015 which provides for certain registration rights with respect to resales of the shares.

The fair value of these equity shares on the date of agreement was ' 1,452 (USD 23.5 million). The upfront consideration received in the form of equity shares is deferred and recognized as revenue over the period in which Aurigene has continuing performance obligations.

Aurigene is also entitled to development and commercial milestone payments as follows:

- · for the first two programs: up to USD 52.5 million per program, including USD 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus pre-specifi ed approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any;
- · for the third and fourth programs: up to USD 50 million per program, including USD 42.5 million for approval and commercial milestones, plus prespecified approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any; and
- · for any program thereafter: up to USD 140.5 million per program, including USD 87.5 million in approval and commercial milestones, plus prespecified approval milestone payments for additional indications, if any.

In addition, Curis has agreed to pay Aurigene royalties, ranging between high single digits to 10%, on its net sales in territories where it commercializes products. Furthermore, Aurigene is entitled to receive a share of Curis' revenues from sublicenses, which share varies based upon specifi ed factors such as the sublicensed territory, whether the sublicense revenue is royalty based or non-royalty based and, in some cases, the stage of the applicable molecule and product at the time the sublicense is granted.

## 2.43: VENEZUELA OPERATIONS

Dr. Reddy's Venezuela, C.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is primarly engaged in import of pharmaceutical products from parent company and other subsidiaries of the company and the sale of such products in Venezuela. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Company's revenues from Venezuela were ' 8,335 (Venezuelan bolivar ("VEF") 813 million).

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government launched an overhaul of the exchange rate system and introduced a new exchange rate mechanism. The Marginal Currency System (known as "SIMADI"), is the third mechanism in the new three-tier exchange rate regime and allows for legal trading of the Venezuelan bolivar for foreign currency with fewer restrictions than other mechanisms in Venezuela (CENCOEX and SICAD) .

The new second tier, SICAD, is a combination of the former second and third tiers, SICAD I and SICAD II, with a rate of approximately 12.0 VEF per USD. The first tier, the offi cial exchange rate, is unchanged and sells dollars at 6.30 VEF per USD for preferential goods.

As on 31 March 2015 the exchange rates in all the three aforesaid tiers are as follows:

- · CENCOEX preferential rate - 6.3 VEF per USD;
- · SICAD rate - 12 VEF per USD; and
- · SIMADI rate - approximately 193 VEF per USD.

As per the existing laws in Venezuela, payments towards the importation of pharmaceutical products qualify for the CENCOEX preferential rate of 6.3 VEF per USD, and the Company has been receiving approvals from the CENCOEX at such preferential rate. Accordingly, monetary assets of VEF 245 million which equate to the amount of import payments (USD 39 million) that are eligible and pending for approval are translated at such preferential rate.

The balance of the Company's Venezuelan monetary assets and liabilities, in the net amount of VEF 88 million, may not qualify for the preferential rate of 6.3 VEF per USD. The Company assessed the rate at which such balances are likely to be realized or settled and believes that it is appropriate to use the SIMADI rate (VEF 193 per USD) to translate such balances. Accordingly, foreign exchange loss amounting to ' 843 on translation of such balance monetary assets and liabilities at SIMADI rate was recorded during the year ended 31 March 2015.
