K SATISH REDDY Chairman

## Dear Member,

There has never been a year such as this. We pray that there never will be any more in our lifetime as well as of our children and grandchildren.

As on May 14, 2021, the virus has infected over 160 million and has claimed the lives of 3.4 million people worldwide. India, the second worst infected country in the world, has witnessed over 25 million cases and more than 270,000 deaths.

Your company's core dictum is 'Good Health Can't Wait'.

Never before in the history of Dr. Reddy's has this maxim been more important than now. In the context of this horri�c pandemic, let us brie�y share with you what your company has done to address the situation.

With the pandemic �aring for the �rst time in April 2020, the primary objective was to ensure health and safety of our employees and their families while continuing to supply medicines across the world. Some of the interventions that we quickly put in place were:

- Ÿ A well-being and support plan that comprised tele-consulting, helplines, 24x7 access to clinical psychologists

G V PRASAD

Co-Chairman and Managing Director

through an online platform and a home isolation program.

- Ÿ Dedicated separate COVID-19 care facilities were launched for employees and dependents in three locations to provide pre-hospitalization care.
- Ÿ For employees working on-site, stringent social distancing and safety measures were deployed in work locations, transport facilities and cafeterias. Other measures included multiple stages of disinfection, provision of personal protective equipment, automating actions that require manual contact. Moreover, we provided a daily hardship allowance.
- Ÿ We contracted for additional insurance coverage for COVID-19 which covered hospitalization and home quarantine expenses. This was extended to our employees and their dependents in India. Employees were also provided additional COVID-19 leave.

At the same time, Dr. Reddy's acted quickly to bring various preventive and curative medicines to deal with COVID-19, including a vaccine. Let us start with our vaccine journey.

## Sputnik V vaccine

- Ÿ In September 2020, when the �rst phase of the pandemic was still raging in India, Dr. Reddy's signed up with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) - Russia's sovereign wealth fund - to cooperate on clinical trials and distribution of Sputnik V vaccine in India. Upon regulatory approval in India, RDIF committed to supply 100 million doses of the vaccine to Dr. Reddy's.
- Ÿ Thereafter, we created a partnership with the Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) of the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India, for advisory support and to use some of BIRAC's clinical trial centers for clinical trials of Sputnik V vaccine.
- Ÿ From December 2020, we commenced clinical trials of Sputnik V. Based on satisfactory data from Phase II trials, we received approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct Phase III clinical trial on 1,500 subjects as part of a randomized, doubleblind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study in India.
- Ÿ Simultaneously, Sputnik V showed strong e�cacy, immunogenicity and safety results in Phase III clinical trials conducted on 19,866 people in Russia by RDIF. The e�cacy of Sputnik V against COVID-19 was reported at 91.6%.
- Ÿ In February 2021, we initiated the process with DCGI for Emergency Use Authorization of Sputnik V. This authorization was granted in April 2021.
- Ÿ On May 1, 2021, the �rst consignment of imported doses of the Sputnik V vaccine landed in India. These received regulatory clearance from the Central Drugs Laboratory, Kasauli, on May 13, 2021. The soft launch of the vaccine commenced and the �rst dose of the vaccine was administered in Hyderabad on May 14, 2021.
- Ÿ Further consignments of imported doses are expected over the coming period. Subsequently, supply of the Sputnik V vaccine will commence from Indian manufacturing partners. Your company is working closely with six manufacturing partners in India to ful�l regulatory requirements to ensure smooth and timely supply.
- Ÿ Sputnik V makes Dr. Reddy's, the third enterprise in India that has been authorized to supply COVID-19 vaccines.
- Ÿ We will work closely with stakeholders in the government and the private sector in India to ensure the widest possible reach of the Sputnik V vaccine as part of the national inoculation e�ort. This is a rea�rmation of our determination to �ght against the COVID-19 pandemic in India.

Sputnik V is not the only commitment of your company regarding COVID-19 treatments. In addition, we have been involved in three other medicines.

- a) Remdesivir: We signed a licensing agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. that grants us the right to register, manufacture and sell Remdesivir, a potential treatment for COVID-19, in 127 countries including India. We launched Remdesivir under the brand name "Redyx™" in India in September 2020. With the surge of COVID-19 cases in the second wave, we ramped-up our capacities to increase availability of the medicine.
- ® b) Avigan (Favipiravir): We entered into a licensing agreement with Fuji�lm Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd. to develop, sell and ® distribute Avigan (Favipiravir) in all countries other than Japan, China and Russia. This has enabled us to launch ® Avigan 200 mg tablets in India and few other markets. We are also conducting
- Phase III trials in North America for outpatient setting with mild to moderate symptoms.
- c) 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG™): The 2-DG has been developed by Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO) laboratories, in collaboration with Dr. Reddy's. The drug received emergency use approval as adjunct therapy for hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients.

We are also working on Molnupiravir, Baricitinib and other COVID-19 drugs for treatment ranging from mild to severe conditions.

To retain basic continuity across our annual letters, let us share the consolidated �nancial results of your company for FY2021.

- Ÿ Consolidated revenues were ' 189.7 billion, or a 9% growth over the previous year.
- Ÿ Consolidated gross pro�t was ' 103.1 billion, which was 10% greater vis-à-vis FY2020.
- Ÿ Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) increased to ' 47.4 billion, or an increase of 2% versus the previous year.
- Ÿ Operating pro�t increased by 52% to ' 24.3 billion.
- Ÿ Pro�t before taxes (PBT) was ' 26.4 billion, which was 46% higher than ' 18 billion earned in the previous year.
- Ÿ Pro�t after taxes (PAT) was ' 17.2 billion, or 12% less than in FY2020.
- Ÿ Diluted earnings per share (EPS) was ' 103.65 in FY2021, versus ' 117.40 in FY2020.

We wish to take this opportunity of thanking every employee of your company for putting in all the extra e�orts in these trying times to make these results happen. They have done spectacular work.

Two of our key promises have been addressing unmet patient needs, and helping patients to manage disease better. Nothing has underscored the importance of these promises as the COVID-19 pandemic.

We do not know when the second wave will subside. Neither do we know whether there will be a third wave and of what intensity. But we do know that the only preventive worth the name is vaccination. And we are committed to seeing that your company plays a key role in the vaccinating program for our citizens.

Because Good Health Can't Wait.

Many of us have lost loved ones during this pandemic, especially in the second wave. Our sincerest condolences to them and our prayers that the families have the spirit and strength to overcome their tragedies.

Stay safe. Vaccinate as soon as you can. Wear masks. Maintain social distancing. This, too, shall pass. But it needs our combined e�orts. And determination to succeed.

With our best regards and prayers,

## VENTURING INTO AMAZON'S ® HEALTHCAREAISLE

## An important milestone for the OTC team in the U.S.

Dr. Reddy's �rst began selling its over-the-® counter Habitrol brand nicotine patches on Amazon in 2016, as an experiment. Shortly after ® ® launching Habitrol , Doan's was added to the portfolio.

The big change came two years later in 2018 when Amazon reached out to us looking for companies that could launch Amazon-exclusive brands in the OTC space. A veteran of the OTC team, Lindsay Pro�tt, was put in charge of an exhaustive branding development program working with one of the best pharma-branding agencies in the business, Brand Institute. Under Pro�tt's leadership, the team worked through hundreds of names and naming conventions and conducted multiple brand research e�orts.

Interestingly, the name 'HealthCareAisle' came up in a casual discussion among the team members. Consumer research seemed to point to the name as innovative and likeable.

In January this year, ® the HealthCareAisle store brand hit a key milestone, achieving US$ 100,000 of sales in a week.

After landing on the name, the team hired another company to design the logo. With the brand and logo in hand, the team went about the business of designing the packaging in-house. Initially, the team thought they were simply going to develop and sell store-brand OTC products to Amazon, not unlike the way they sell to other big-box retailers and drug store chains. However, they quickly learned that, in order to be successful, you need to sell through Amazon, not to Amazon.

The team hired another experienced agency to help them navigate the Amazon business framework and also develop a marketing and merchandising plan speci�cally for Amazon. The key learnings, as well as strategy and brand development, took most of 2019, and by 2020, Dr. Reddy's direct-to-consumer strategic priority gained the necessary traction and proved its ® viability. In January this year, the HealthCareAisle store brand hit a key milestone, achieving US$ 100,000 of sales in a week.

At the current growth rate, the Amazon direct-toconsumer channel is now a key growth driver for the OTC business, and the team plans to launch products on Amazon �rst and then to other channels. Additionally, they anticipate ramping up to double their online portfolio to 50+ products in the foreseeable future.

## LIVING OUR PURPOSE

## How our teams kept medicine supplies to Europe moving during the pandemic

When �ights began to be grounded at the beginning of the pandemic, our global supply chain acted quickly and with persistence to �nd new solutions. One example is the launch of a crucial generic medicine (Cinacalcet) in Europe.

In April 2020, with �ve days to go for the launch of the product, lockdowns and work-from-home policies began to be enforced in Europe. We found ourselves suddenly needing to �nd various alternatives on extremely short notice. Working remotely in many cases, colleagues began to hunt for the same. A major hurdle was the closing of airports in some countries - including at our import location in the European Union (EU), which was critical for this launch as the product was being �own in from India. To �nd alternatives, the Supply Chain team worked closely together with the Quality and Logistics teams to �nd ways to address the situation working late nights and through the weekend in an attempt to approve a new import location. In parallel, the manufacturing site in India implemented safety and hygiene measures in record time to ensure that manufacturing continued without delay.

## AIR, ROAD, SEA

Instead of a direct �ight from India to the �nal destination in Europe as originally planned, the new arrangement was to �y the product from India to another country with an open airport in Europe, then transport the medicines �rst by road through two more countries before taking the ferry to reach the �nal destination � of course, ensuring supply chain security at every step of the journey.

What followed was an excellent demonstration of clockwork precision and team play to ensure that the product made it to the destination on time. After due procedures, the product was launched as per plan with no delay.

## STRONGER TOGETHER

To us, this story is an example of how our colleagues around the world have truly lived our brand principles of empathy and dynamism during the pandemic. It is as much a tribute to the sense of ownership and steadfastness shown by our colleagues in quickly adapting to new and unforeseen challenges posed by the pandemic, as it is to the personal and professional adjustments made by them to enable the same. The joy derived from recognizing the impact of one's work in meeting the unmet needs of patients and contributing to society is unmatched and has renewed our commitment to deliver on our purpose and responsibility towards patients and society.

Hard work, collaborative e�ort, clockwork precision and team play ensured that the product made it to Europe on time, and was launched without delay.

## FUTURE-READY WITH VIRTUAL REALITY

## Training employees using VR in Hyderabad and Vizag

As a pharmaceutical company, we believe in applying scienti�c techniques not only to come up with quality products, but also to increase overall e�ciency in our facilities around the world. Manufacturing is a key process where we have embraced future-ready innovations so that our employees can learn new things quickly and easily. At the same time, manufacturing must also ensure quality, safety and e�ciency � crucial tenets in the pharmaceutical world.

After intensive training, workers who join the shop �oor are often overwhelmed by the plant environment and machine sizes for the �rst few days. In addition, they must apply their training in this environment, which can be challenging. We realised that a simulated training environment could go a long way to teach new employees the ropes, without them being intimidated by the equipment and keeping safe.

Enter our Virtual Reality Labs in Hyderabad and Vizag, where our employees train in manufacturing processes before joining the production �oor. They get accustomed to their work environment, learn to perform safety checks, machine operations and quality checks.

The success of any virtual reality implementation project stands on selecting the most challenging scenarios and converting them into simulated cases or situations. Our content and technology partners worked seamlessly together to replicate our plant designs, machines and processes in the virtual world so that our employees can train in accurate modes and environments. For example, the VR module of our compression machine sees the employee performing various tasks virtually such as wearing PPEs, reviewing safety checks,

machine calibrations and so on. In real life, this is a huge hydraulics machine where a new operator may face a variety of safety and e�ciency challenges. Operated with Human-Machine Interface, in a real scenario, a new resource can run into various safety hazards.

Our virtual reality training programmes help to bridge gaps in skill among incoming employees. It is at least �� percent more e�cient than traditional training methods and allows trainers to monitor employees' psychomotor skills, their levels of alertness and their reactions during emergencies. And our people, in turn, enjoy the experience.

Sridhar Sunkara, who anchored the VR fermentation module, says, "This is an excellent initiative. The machine is very interactive, it will de�nitely boost interest in learning." In fact, those who have trained in our VR labs are eagerly awaiting the opening of our third lab in Baddi. "This setup is very good, and it provides excellent on-the-job training," says Shweta Sharma, who attended the blender module.

As we go onwards and upwards, we know our people are the wind beneath our wings. We are committed to empowering them using the latest technologies and scienti�c know-how.

## LIGHTHOUSE FACTORIES

## Creating role models to lead the way to a smarter world

The world is progressing at a dizzying pace as we experience the Fourth Industrial Revolution - the automation of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices using smart tech. We too are gearing up to be future-ready, and one of the steps we've taken in this direction is to initiate an internal pilot to gradually transform our factories to become 'lighthouse' factories.

The lighthouses are some of the world's most advanced factories from both digital and sustainable perspectives. These serve as beacons of light for the rest of the industry, and Dr. Reddy's wants to be at the forefront as a leading pharmaceutical company.

Our �rst pilot site for this transformation �ourney is the FTO-2 manufacturing unit located in Hyderabad. We believe in embracing the most current technologies to improve manufacturing e�ciency, while at the same time contributing to sustainable goals. The transformation has signi�cant impact on our culture and capability, product quality, process robustness, e�ciency and productivity.

A digitally enabled factory of the future transforms the lives of the people on the shop�oor and in the labs. Integrated systems provide information about priorities, shift planning, performance against plan indicators and realignment of plans where necessary based on exceptions and delays. All equipment is monitored real-time; information tracking and decision-making are easier, thereby signi�cantly improving supply chain metrics.

"The scale and speed at which new-age technology solves problems is amazing. It has to be applied aptly to improve end-to-end value for the organization," says G V Prasad, our CoChairman and Managing Director. Of course, manufacturing e�ciency will ultimately help us to make our medicines more accessible and a�ordable, because Good Health Can't Wait.

We believe in embracing the most current technologies to improve manufacturing e�ciency� while at the same time contributing to sustainable goals.

## SECTION E

## PRINCIPLE 1

## ETHICS, TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY

- 1. Does the policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption cover only the company? Does it extend to the group/joint ventures/suppliers/ contractors/NGOs/others?

Yes. The policy relating to ethics, bribery and corruption extends beyond our employees, both whole-time and independent directors and covers our wholly-owned subsidiaries. While contracts with our business partners, contractors and business partners include adherence to our principles concerning ethics, there is a separate code of conduct required to be adhered to by our business partners and service providers.

- 2. How many stakeholder complaints have been received in the past �nancial year and what percentage was satisfactorily resolved by the management?

During FY2021, the company received 167 concerns through various channels of Ombuds reporting. All these concerns are investigated and acted upon. As of March 31, 2021, 23 of these concerns were pending for closure.

## PRINCIPLE 2

## PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE SUSTAINABILITY

- 1. List up to three of your products or services whose design has incorporated social or environmental concerns, risks and/or opportunities.
- Ÿ Sitagliptin
- Ÿ Continuous Manufacturing (b) Canagli�o�in (a) Atorvastatin Calcium
- 2. For each such product, provide the following details in respect of resource use (energy, water, raw material etc.) per unit of product (optional):

## i. Sitagliptin

We have continued to apply and embed 12 principles of green chemistry in our research and development pursuits. We identi�ed a synthesis of Sitagliptin in which a catalytic enantioselective carbonyl reduction aiming to develop a greener and cost e�ective route to meet the business needs without compromising on the environmental considerations is adopted.

I n this endeavor, we have reduced the Process Mass Intensity substantially and quanti�ed as given below:

## ii. Continuous Manufacturing

The pharmaceutical industry has so far relied on batch processes for manufacturing drug substances as well as drug products. However, longer campaign times, labor intensive nature of batch manufacturing (which has a signi�cant impact on production cost) and batch rejections/batch to batch variations in the product quality (which leads to wastage/regulatory concerns) are huge drawbacks of batch processing. In addition, an increasing pressure on quality and costs has all led the pharma industry towards gradually embracing the concept of continuous manufacturing.

Continuous manufacturing o�ers many advantages such as shorter processing times, increased safety, increased e�ciency, less WIP material, lesser manual handling and smaller footprint. It is also amenable to real-time release testing approaches.

At Dr. Reddy's, the API team has embarked upon this journey & signi�cant progress has been made on two products:

## (a) Atorvastatin Calcium:

An existing batch/commercial process of high volume API (Atorvastatin Calcium) consisting of multiple chemical conversions & unit operations is being redeveloped to generate a completely integrated system starting from raw materials to dried API via �ow processing. There are four chemical conversions followed by unit operations of crystalli�ation, �ltration, drying & powder processing involved in commercial process and two chemical conversions as per the improved CIP process . There is isolation & quality testing of compounds at each of these steps. A continuous manufacturing process is developed using �ow chemistry principles wherein isolations at all intermittent steps are eliminated thus making the process lean. This new process has the potential to reduce the cycle time of manufacturing from days to few hours. Reaction times in continuous mode are in minutes as compared to long hours of reaction in batch mode. Flow approach has enabled to explore design space that would be impractical (even impossible) in batch mode.

Few salient comparisons between batch & �ow process are mentioned in the table below:

Note: ATV & ATN refers to Atorvastatin calcium

This process has been successfully tested at pilot scale. Bene�ts of this approach, when implemented at commercial level, lesser space for machine, reduction in manual activity and reduction in overhead cost.

## (b) Canagli�o�in

In this product, a highly exothermic & hazardous reaction involving the use of n-Butyl Lithium has been designed & optimized in�ow using a Vapourtec �ow reactor at lab. Rig, which is designed for scale up to plant, is installed at API-SEZ & few trials have been taken to establish �ow process at plant scale. Better control on reaction & inherent safety is achieved by changing this reaction from batch to �ow.

## 3. Does the company have procedures in place for sustainable sourcing (including transportation)? If yes, what percentage of your inputs was sourced sustainably?

Yes, we have well de�ned and documented "Supplier Code of Conduct" for our business partners, wherein we ensure that our business partners are aware of the code of conduct and follow the same appropriately. The Code of Conduct addresses all the elements of sustainable sourcing with special emphasis on supply continuity, quality and compliance, capacity and capability building, long-term business relationships, and overall sustainable performance management. We also have dedicated team at SCM which helps business partners align with our vision of sustainability and for capability building.

Few of the initiatives are listed below:

## Risk Mitigation:

At Dr. Reddy's, we believe in mutually sustainable growth coupled with stability. In line with this philosophy, we conduct a business partner risk assessment to ensure the sustainability and stability of our business partners. Our business partner risk assessment framework comprises two key aspects viz. "Organizational Risks" and "Supplier Sustainability Risks".

We are associated with an independent risk assessment agency to conduct the risk assessment for our business partners. The agency M/s. Dun & Bradstreet-India conducts a full �edged sustainability assessment for our business partner and if necessary specify any improvement areas based on a scoring criteria which becomes part of the �nal assessment report.

Ÿ Ÿ

Ÿ

Ÿ

All critical business partners contributing to 80% of sales value have to undergo assessment and reassessment at a �xed frequency depending on the sourcing category i.e. (API's, excipients, packaging etc). The frequency of assessment is once in every two years for API's/excipients, three years for primary packaging and four years for secondary packaging.

## Ease of doing business:

In order to build transparency and to simplify business transactions, we carry out our routine transactions on a digital platform and a dedicated portal is available for our partners viz. Vikreta2Connect, which facilitates the whole process of procure to pay (P2P). It serves as a one stop solution to provide our business partners better visibility on RFQs, POs release, PO acknowledgement, ASN, invoice submission, GRNs & payment status and other related services.

The Vikreta portal has e�cient invoice management resulting in faster processing of invoices that has resulted in on-time payments to our business partners. Also, uploading digital invoices has promoted paperless transactions. Here, business partners can make advance shipment noti�cation before executing dispatches making the operations quite easy.

## Forecasting Accuracy:

We have been working to improve the forecasting model across all major geographies and the overall forecast accuracy level is above 70%. Despite the challenges due to COVID-19 we have been able to sustain and service the markets without any major impact.

There is a reduction of approx. 31% in overall COPE (Cost of Poor Execution) due to better forecasting and accuracy levels, which led to less wastage while serving more volume of business during FY2021.

Rolling forecasts on a quarterly basis are also shared with our business partners to help them to plan their input materials availability, capacity allocation etc. Sharing forecasts on a regular basis has helped in better inventory management, avoiding rushorders, avoidance of air mode shipments/reduction in logistics costs.

## Cost Competitiveness:

We work with our business partners to drive the process of Cost Improvement Programmes (CIPs) wherein we jointly identify and explore new ideas or opportunities that would help in overall reduction of costs or reduce expenditure or also help in increasing e�ciency (like reduction of wastages, reduction of solvent consumption, improving process/minimising ine�ciency etc).

We develop plans/strategy to generate savings opportunities and to stay cost competitive in end markets and improve a�ordability of the �nal product.

Alternate vendor development for imported materials that has signi�cant cost-reduction opportunity and to promote local manufacturing.

## Air vs. Sea shipment:

We have a process in place to monitor the overall air vs. sea shipments to maximize the export shipments by sea, and yearly plans are laid down (market speci�c targets are assigned) for shifting �nished goods movement from air to sea.

There has been an increase of approximately 2-3% in the share of sea shipments in the reporting period as compared to FY2020, contributing 57% in total export shipments in FY2021.

There has been an increase of approximately 2-3% in the share of sea shipments in the reporting period as compared to FY2020, contributing 57% in total export shipments in FY2021.

- 4. Has the company taken any steps to procure goods and services from local & small producers, including communities surrounding their place of work? If yes, what steps have been taken to improve their capacity and capability of local and small vendors? Yes, small scale industries form a crucial part of our business partner base. We have been making continuous e�orts to encourage both local and small scale business partners by hand-holding them and providing technical support to meet any speci�c requirement of Dr. Reddy's, sometimes making advance payment to help them in their sourcing activities, building capacity and supply of materials to us.

Import Substitution is another initiative in our e�orts of localization that has helped us in getting better costadvantage, better management of inventory, better compliance control and it has led to signi�cant reduction in lead time and cost savings along with reduction in carbon footprint due to signi�cant reduction in transportation. Local manufacturers were encouraged to take up the related development activities of the import substitution products, and required technical support is provided by Dr. Reddy's in troubleshooting, conducting process validations, quality improvements and better process controls, and overall also providing long-term commitments.

## Few of the initiatives taken in this direction include:

- Ÿ We help local business partners to customize their existing products to meet our product requirements and thus eliminate import shipments.
- Ÿ In terms of packaging materials, procurement from small scale industries has been recorded to be about 17% of total packaging material procurement.
- Ÿ The imports contributed to about 24% of the total packaging material procurement cost, which was reduced by around 3% in the current year especially from the large volume materials.
- 5. Does the company have a mechanism to recycle products and wastes? If yes, what is the percentage of recycled products and wastes?

We have aspiringly taken the target to attain 100% waste neutrality by 2023 for India and globally by 2025 including plastic waste.

In this reporting period of FY2021, we had achieved waste neutrality in India of 98.98% and 100% in plastic waste whereas globally waste neutrality is 98.16% & plastic waste 50%.

On the waste water recycling front, we have nine ZLDs across our manufacturing facilities in India, which provide 100% waste water recycling for 16 out of our 18 facilities.

Our community development initiatives are inclusive and designed towards sustainability. We involve the gram panchayat or local government in the project development discussions.

For education programs, we encourage the participation of parents in the school management committee (SMC) meetings, in which even local leaders participate, to instill ownership, and a mandal education o�cer (MEO) reviews the school performance on a quarterly basis. Youth participating in the vocational skills enhancing program, pay a small percentage of the course fees. For health programs, local panchayat and villagers were involved right at the beginning. Villagers and local government authorities have given space for running out patient (OP) wards and bene�ciaries, i.e. the community members are given the responsibility of running the OP and scheduling the patients. Patients are showing a positive attitude towards minimal contribution sought from them for rendering medical services at their door steps. For other community development initiatives as well, we engage the local authorities whose active involvement encourages participation and ownership from the community members.

- 3. Is there any case �led by any stakeholder against the company regarding unfair trade practices, irresponsible advertising and/ or anticompetitive behavior during the last �ve years and pending as on end of the �nancial year?

On December 18, 2016, the Attorneys General for 19 states in the United States of America �led claims in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against a number of pharmaceutical companies alleging conspiracies to �x prices and to allocate bids and customers from 2013 through at least 2016, with respect to two generic drugs. Initially, our U.S. subsidiaries were not named as defendants. However, in April 2017, a total of 45 states, plus the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, joined as plainti� s in this case (the "State AG Action") which in August 2017, were consolidated with the private plainti� class actions pending in the multi-district litigation ("MDL-2724") in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. On October 31, 2017, the Attorneys General for the 45 States, plus the District of Columbia and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, �led an amended complaint in the State AG Action in MDL-2724 which added our U.S. subsidiary, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., as a defendant. Further, on May 10, 2019, the Attorneys General of forty-nine U.S. States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, �led a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against 21 generic pharmaceutical companies (including our U.S. subsidiary) and 15 individual defendants alleging that our U.S. subsidiary and the other named defendants engaged in a conspiracy to �x prices and to allocate bids and customers in the United States in the sale of the 116 named drugs. Our U.S. subsidiary is speci�cally named as a defendant with respect to �ve generic drugs (cipro�oxacin HCL tablets, glimepiride tablets, oxaprozin tablets, paricalcitol and tizanidine), and is named as an alleged co-conspirator on an alleged "overarching conspiracy" with respect to the other 13 generic drugs named. We deny the claims asserted and intend to vigorously defend against the claims asserted.

<!-- image -->

COVID-19 related disruptions impacting the demand for certain sets of products, the supply chain and operations. We rose to the challenges and ensured minimal impact to operations. We ensured the health and safety of our employees and business partners. We continued innovating new solutions to operate under the di�cult circumstances. We worked upon new avenues of growth such as development and launch of COVID-19 products portfolio and successfully integrated the portfolio acquired from Wockhardt for our India business. We were able to grow businesses across all our geographies, viz. GG for North America, Europe, India, several emerging economies, and PSAI across many parts of the world.

Our focus on cost controls, productivity improvements and on creating a leaner and more de-layered business model continued from the previous year. This helped us to become more e�cient and also improve our pro�ts.

Improvements in revenue and EBITDA in FY2021 were mainly due to the following factors.

Growth in branded generics markets: We continued our growth momentum across the key branded generics markets of India, CIS countries, China and some other regions. This was due to improved base business as well as the launch of new products. We also acquired a select portfolio from Wockhardt for the India business. Growth in Russia, however, was hindered due to an overall market slowdown.

Growth in the PSAI business: PSAI growth was driven by base business traction in API, custom pharmaceutical services and a favorable forex movement.

Continued growth momentum in the Europe generics business: FY2021 saw signi�cant growth in the existing geographies as well as newer markets in Europe - driven by expansion of the base business coupled with new product launches.

Moving ahead on our journey of cost control: We continued making solid progress on the journey that began in FY2019 to trim cost structures through enhanced productivity and elimination of waste across our businesses. The initiatives that were put in place to drive cost e�ciencies and productivity improvement across manufacturing, procurement, R&D expenditures and marketing spends played a signi�cant part in improving the �nancial performance of the company. While we focused on productivity, we are also making investments to build capabilities, brands and product pipeline.

EBITDA growth was, however, impacted on a higher base of FY2020, when we had recognized income on the sale of our commercialized neurology products in the Proprietary Products (PP) in the US and selected territory rights.

## A SNAPSHOT OF PERFORMANCE

Revenue from GG in FY2021 was GLOBAL GENERICS (GG)

₹ 154.4 billion , which represented an increase of 12% compared to the previous year. This growth was largely attributable to impressive performances witnessed in Europe, certain emerging markets, contribution from portfolio acquired from Wockhardt for India business as well as favorable forex rates.

Revenue from North America Generics (NAG) was ₹ 70.5 billion, with a growth of 9% versus FY2020. This growth was supported by the launch of 27 new products. Of these, the major new launches were Cipro�oxacin Dexamethasone, OTC Diclofenac, Sapropterin, Abiraterone (Canada) and Colchicine tablets. It should be noted that while there was a healthy growth in the sales volumes of our existing products and favorable forex movement, these were o�set by pricing pressures on some of our key products, such as Buprenorphine and Naloxone sublingual �lms, Atorvastatin, Metoprolol and Liposomal Doxorubicin.

In FY2021, we �led 20 new Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and one New Drug Application (NDA) under the section 505(b)(2) with the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). As on March 31, 2021, we had 95 generic �lings pending approval from the USFDA. These comprise 92 ANDAs and three New Drug Applications (NDAs) �led under the Section 505(b)(2) route of the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act. Of these, 47 are Para IV applications and we believe that 23 of these have 'First to File' status.

R evenue from Europe was ₹ 15.4 billion, representing a growth of 32% compared to FY2020. This was primarily due to expansion of the base business and new product launches. Growth was also aided by the scaling up of our businesses in newer markets of Italy, Spain and France, as well as favorable forex movement.

Revenue from Emerging Markets was ₹ 35.1 billion, or a growth of 7% compared to FY2020. This was driven by an improvement in our base business performance, new product launches and scale up of business in some of our new markets.

- Ÿ Revenue from Russia was ₹ 15.8 billion , representing a year-on-year decline of 6% due to a depreciation of ruble compared to the Indian rupee. Moreover, sales were subdued on account of an overall market slowdown.
- Ÿ Revenue from other CIS countries and Romania was ₹ 7.4 billion , or an annual growth of 15%.
- Ÿ Revenue from Rest of the World (RoW) territories was ₹ 11.8 billion , or a yearon-year growth of 25%.

Revenue from India was ₹ 33.4 billion, which represented a growth of 15% compared to FY2020. This was primarily attributable to contribution from acquired portfolio of products from Wockhardt and launch of new products including those related to COVID-19. During FY2021, we launched 20 new brands in India.

## PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES AND ACTIVE INGREDIENTS (PSAI)

Revenues from PSAI stood at ₹ 32 billion, or a growth of 24% versus FY2020 mainly driven by traction in base business, services business growth and favorable forex movement. During the year, we �led 149 Drug Master Files (DMFs) worldwide, including 14 �lings in the US.

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

Revenue from PP was ₹ 0.5 billion . This translated to a decline of 93% following the divestment of commercialized products from our neurology franchise in FY2020.

## GLOBAL PHARMACEUTICAL 1 MARKET OUTLOOK

The last year marked one of the most challenging year for all of humanity with the COVID-19 pandemic severely a�ecting the global population. The pandemic continues unabated with a severe second wave currently engul�ng India, having previously wreaked havoc on the US and certain key European nations. As on May 14, 2021, the virus has infected over 160 million and has claimed the lives of 3.4 million people worldwide. The impact of the pandemic has also been severe in terms of the indirect

number of casualties and su�ering due to global lockdowns, delays in health screenings and treatments along with the rise in cases of mental health disorders. COVID-19 led to a disruption in medicine usage varying in both timing and magnitude in developed and pharmerging countries alike during the last year. These included signi�cant stock-piling of over-the-counter chronic and mental health medicines during the initial stages of the pandemic. Medicine usage was also impacted by frequent and widespread global lockdowns.

The pandemic also emphasized the value of health infrastructure, medical research and science; and prompted a renewed focus on public health institutions, epidemiology and racial and ethical disparities and inequalities in health. It prompted extraordinary responses from the healthcare industry, the research community, public health administrators and governments to develop new therapeutics, repurpose existing drugs, and to develop new vaccines at speeds that have never been seen before.

Relentless e�orts and ingenuity of scientists and the pharmaceutical industry led to cutting the traditional timeline for the development of new vaccines from four to 12 years on an average to just seven months. Novel methods of R&D were created along with active cross-border collaborations. These have set new standards and shorter timeframes for discovery and innovation for other life-threatening diseases in the future.

The pandemic also proved to be a fuel for digitally-driven therapeutic change whether these be remote and virtual patient-doctor engagements through telemedicine and tele-health, digitized clinical trials leveraging arti�cial intelligence and the introduction of new disruptive business models. Indeed, COVID-19 has become the most signi�cant trigger to force the major players in the industry to signi�cantly expand their digital capabilities well beyond their normal annual plans

Equally, none can deny the major disruptions, especially ones relating to manufacturing and the supply chain.

While the landscape of the pharmaceutical industry was radically altered by the pandemic, probably more than any other sector, the industry will surely take stock of how it navigated the pandemic. And, in doing so, it will have to be prepared for similar sudden shifts and disruptions in operations and regulations in the longer term.

Adoption of novel treatments, o�set by sti� competition from generics and biosimilars and patent lifecycles, will continue to in�uence medicine spending and growth in the developed markets. The global

pharmaceutical market is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 6% CAGR over the next �ve years to reach US$ 1.6 trillion from US$ 1.1 trillion currently. In addition, the cumulative spend on COVID-19 vaccinations is anticipated to be around US$ 157 billion over the next �ve years. Much of this growth in vaccine demand will be in the pharmerging markets, being partially o�set by a slower growth in the developed economies.

The US market is expected to grow in the range of 0% to 3% CAGR over the next �ve years, down from 3% CAGR in the past �ve. Japan, the third largest global market, should see a decline in medicine spends as a result of the continued biennial price cut policy, and policies to encourage a shift to generics for older medicines. The European market should grow by US$ 35 billion in the next �ve years with a focus on generics and biosimilars. Growth in pharmerging markets is expected to be led by China, and might accelerate post-COVID-19.

Table 1 gives the historical and forecasted pharmaceuticals growth outlook for the major countries of the world.

The number of new active substances (NAS) launches are projected to continue with an average of 54 to 63 per year over the next �ve years.

Spend on speciality medicines is expected to be nearly 60% in developed markets and 50% globally in the next �ve years, with the older and traditional therapies becoming progressively less expensive over time.

Oncology and immunology, the two largest therapy areas, should grow 9% to 12% CAGR through 2025, led by signi�cant increase in new treatments and medicine use. Oncology is forecasted to add 100 new treatments over the next �ve years, contributing to an increased spend in excess of US$ 100 billion.

Globally, the Oncology market is forecasted to add 100 new treatments over the next �ve years, contributing to an increased spend in excess of US$ 100 billion.

While the future of medicine use will be in�uenced by a number of complex factors which shall emerge after the pandemic �nally peters out, there is expected to be a renewed focus on (i) improved and e�cient manufacturing technologies; (ii) augmenting pharmaceutical supply-chains; (iii) novel methods of drug development; and (iv) increased adoption of digital tools.

We now share with you some key trends that are likely to emerge.

- Ÿ Smaller-scale manufacturing with �e�ible production capabilities for improved e�ciency: Novel technologies such as cell and gene therapy will push the industry towards rapidly deployable facilities, with smaller scale, modular and portable plants being deployed. This will raise speed to market, diversify the manufacturing footprint globally and increase the need for real-time supply chain management. The pharmaceutical industry will also utilize such capability to cater to changing market dynamics such as small batches of precision medicine - unlike what is needed for mass production of pharmaceuticals. On the �ip side, when a smaller number of medications are produced, these will

serve a smaller number of patients. Hence, a challenge associated with this model will be to raise pro�ts through fast production to accommodate di�erent demands.

- Ÿ Emergence of new API competitors and increase in high potency API (HPAPI) capacity: The competition for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is expected to increase as more programs advance into late-stage clinical trials. Strengthening of supply chains will continue to become increasingly important as companies start to think strategically to develop secondary sourcing plans and carry signi�cant inventory to minimize risks of a stock-out. Most likely, this will lead to the emergence of several new competitors in the API space. An area of growth in the industry is the high-potency active pharmaceutical ingredient (HPAPI) space. The HPAPI market alone is expected to grow to US$ 33 billion by 2025, up from US$ 16 billion in 2016. Importance of these HPAPIs lies in creating e�ective patient-centric treatments that require lesser doses to achieve the same therapeutic impact. We expect more API manufacturers, including contract service
- providers, to expand their aseptic and HPAPI capacity to meet higher customer demand.
- Ÿ Greater focus on R&D value leveraging arti�cial intelligence (AI) for improved e�ciency: With an increased focus on the value of medications, pharmaceutical companies are increasingly examining their R&D practices to ensure these are re�ned and sharply focused. The estimated R&D cost of each USFDA approved drug is around US$ 2.6 billion. The use of AI in drug discovery can expedite the overall R&D process by improving success rates by 8% to 10%, resulting in savings worth billions of dollars. AI can be also used to �nd candidate molecules for drugs, develop compounds from scratch, and aid the process of synthesizing the molecules with better e�cacy.
- Ÿ Renewed focus on mergers & acquisitions (M&As): 2020 was slow for M&As in the pharmaceutical industry, thanks to the economic instability brought about by COVID-19. The year saw nearly US$ 184 billion in M&A deals, which was one of the lowest in almost a decade. Instead of M&As, pharmaceutical companies focused on establishing partnerships to help �ght the pandemic and develop vaccines. They not only partnered together but also established crossindustry partnerships with academic and healthcare establishments. However, in 2021, the focus should shift back to traditional level of M&A deals. According to a report by Price Waterhouse Coopers, M&A deals in 2021 are predicted to be about US$ 250-275 billion. If that were so, it will mark a return to normal M&A activity for the industry.
- Ÿ Move towards patient-centric care model: The pandemic has driven the pharmaceutical industry towards a more patient-centered care model. This requires deep understanding of a patient's health condition and needs in order to deliver more e�cient treatment and ensure better availability of such treatments. The emphasis on treating patients with more e�ective drugs is encouraging innovators at early stages of drug production to incorporate patientcentered insights. Sounder targeting of patient's needs will help the industry achieve better clinical results and ensure that pharmaceutical companies produce more e�ective medicines that improve their therapeutic value.
- Ÿ Acceleration in digital transformation: Digital transformation in the pharmaceutical industry was already in progress before the pandemic. COVID-19 gave it an impetus like never before. Several pharmaceutical companies took many positive steps towards digitization

- such as appointing chief digital o�cers to their boards and implementing a data-�rst approach in their operations. The sector recognized that the digital revolution was here to stay and, in a datarich industry, o�ered considerable bene�ts. During the pandemic, many of the industry's core activities moved to the virtual sphere. This has signi�cantly accelerated digital adaptations, both within the pharmaceutical industry and in the healthcare systems it serves.

- Ÿ Increased automation in the pharmaceutical supply chain: Innovation in technology is expected to impact not just drug development but also the supply chain, ranging from speed to safety to manpower. Automation in pharmaceutical manufacturing can help build more resilient, �exible and supply coste�ective chains. These can help make the batch unit operations more e�cient, recon�gurable and streamlined, and thus reduce the production-to-market timeline by allowing the faster technical transfer of data and greater versatility of equipment throughout the API network. It may also help to get better insights and recommendations, whether these be commercial, marketing or clinical trials data.
- Ÿ Expansion of global vaccine manufacturing capabilities: Production of vaccines has traditionally been done by a handful of companies. However, given the pandemic, individual countries want a certain level of autonomy. This has led to expansion in vaccine production capacities in Asia and the Middle East. Biologics and vaccine manufacturing capacity needed globally for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments is expected to take a signi�cant percentage of the overall available capacity. This growth in demand for vaccine manufacturing capacity that we have seen in 2020 will continue into 2021 and perhaps beyond.

## NORTH AMERICA GENERICS (NAG) DR. REDDY'S MARKET PERFORMANCE, FY2021

NAG is Dr. Reddy's largest market. In FY2021, it contributed to around 46% of the company's GG sales, and 37% of overall sales.

Revenue from the region for FY2021 was ₹ 70.5 billion (US$ 948 million), representing a growth of 9% over the previous year. Even so, the year continued to see signi�cant price erosion due to increased competition across some

major products. However, this impact was signi�cantly o�set by an increase in volumes for some of our base products, and contribution from new product launches - the important ones being Cipro�oxacin Dexamethasone, OTC Diclofenac, Sapropterin, Abiraterone (Canada) and Colchicine tablets. Growth was further aided by the strengthening of the US dollar against Indian rupee. Some key developments were:

- Ÿ Launched Cipro�oxacin Dexamethasone Otic suspension, a therapeutic equivalent generic version ® of Ciprodex (cipro�oxacin 0.3% and dexamethasone 0.1%), used in treatment of acute otitis.
- Ÿ Launched OTC Diclofenac Sodium topical gel, the store brand version of ® Voltaren , used in treatment of arthritic pain.
- Ÿ Launched the generic version of Sapropterin Dihydrochloride tablets, used in treatment of blood phenylalanine levels.
- Ÿ Launched Abiraterone Acetate tablets USP, 250 mg, a therapeutic equivalent ® generic version of Zytiga , used in treatment of prostate cancer.
- Ÿ Launched Colchicine tablets USP, a therapeutic equivalent generic version ® of Colcrys , used in treatment of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).
- Ÿ Gained market share in certain key products, such as Omeprazole DR and Metoprolol ER.

The PSAI business recorded revenues of ₹32 billion in FY2021, representing a 24% growth over the previous year.

In FY2021 we �led 149 drug master �les (DMFs) globally, of which 14 were in the US.

This business primarily comprises of APIs and pharmaceutical services. We believe that with recent market developments, there will be a good opportunity for us to expand our API business. We are also focusing on expanding our services business and expect it to be a growth driver. With this intent, Aurigene Pharmaceutical Services Limited (APSL), a newly formed company, has been carved out to focus on contract research, development and manufacturing operations (CDMO).

Our strategy of building a sustainable and growing business involves new product launches and ramping up of base businesses in key geographies. We will also leverage our relationships with key customers by supplying materials that have value addition instead being 'plain-vanilla' APIs. We aim to be a partner of choice for global generics manufacturers and achieve global leadership through costs and service.

## Revenue from PSAI for FY2021 was ₹ 32 billion

## PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS (PP)

The PP business recorded revenue of ₹ 0.5 billion in FY2021, a decline of 93% following the divestment of two brands of our neurology franchise in FY2020. Going forward, our strategy is to focus on an in-house pipeline in a well calibrated manner which strives to achieve an optimal balance between risks and costs. At an overall level, this aligns well with our renewed strategy to enable us to achieve self-sustainability and pro�table growth for each of our businesses.

## ENTERPRISE-WIDE RISK MANAGEMENT (ERM)

Our ERM function operates with the following objectives:

- Ÿ Proactively identify and highlight risks to relevant stakeholders;
- Ÿ Facilitate discussions around risk prioritization and mitigation;
- Ÿ Provide a framework to assess appetite;
- Ÿ Develop systems to warn when the appetite is being breached; and
- Ÿ Provide an analysis of residual risk.

The ERM team connects with our business units and functions, which are the primary sources for risk identi�cation. It also monitors external trends on liabilities and risks reported by peers in the industry. The team collaborates with the compliance, internal audit, information security, safety

and other assurance teams to identify and mitigate risks of business units, including risk relating to cyber security.

Our ERM function focuses on identi�cation of key business, and operational and strategic risks. These are carried out through structured interviews, on-call discussions, and review of incidents.

Risks are aggregated at the unit, function and organization levels and are categorized by risk groups. Our response framework categorizes these risks into (i) internal (preventable), (ii) internal (strategic) and (iii) external risks. The �nance, investment and risk management (FIRM) council is a management level committee that helps the ERM function to prioritize organizationwide risks and steer mitigation e�orts in line with our risk appetite.

Mitigation work carried out by the ERM team is periodically reviewed, and progress on key risks is discussed with the FIRM council, our senior management, as well as at the risk management committee of the board of directors. These include (i) updates on the progress of mitigation of key risks and (ii) speci�c risk-related initiatives carried out during the year.

During FY2021, risk mitigation e�orts included review of cyber security, ethics and compliance program across the company, monitoring of environmental including climate change related risks and reviews of other operating risk exposures.

## HUMAN RESOURCES (HR)

With the pandemic in FY2021, the primary objective was to facilitate health and safety of our employees and their families while ensuring that we continue supplying medicines across the world. A number of interventions and support mechanisms were put in place to transition to remote working and also safeguard the well-being of those employees coming to sites. Some of these were:

- Ÿ A well-being and support plan was launched comprising tele-consulting, helplines, 24x7 unlimited access to certi�ed clinical psychologists through an online platform and a home isolation program. Dedicated separate COVID-19 care facilities were launched for employees and dependents across three locations to provide pre-hospitalization care amidst the dire state of uncertainty in the external environment.
- Ÿ For employees coming on-site in manufacturing and R&D, stringent social distancing and safety measures were deployed in the work locations, transport facilities and cafeterias. Other measures included multiple stages of disinfection, provision of personal protective equipment and automating actions that require manual contact. Daily hardship allowance was also provided.
- Ÿ An additional insurance coverage for COVID-19 which covers hospitalization and home quarantine expenses was extended for employees and their dependents in India. Employees have also been provided a provision of additional COVID-19 leave.
- Ÿ Support mechanisms to enhance work from home experience like ergonomic infrastructure and network support through mobile data plans were provided and work from home guidelines were shared.

A combination of ambiguity in the external environment with the new reality of remote working, virtual collaboration and unsupervised workdays has become the new normal. We have relooked at our people processes with that lens. In doing so, we have revamped our performance process to help employees work in this new reality and pursue individual and organizational priorities. The new performance process has been developed with the following principles in mind:

We revamped our performance process to help employees work in this new reality and pursue individual and organizational priorities.

- Ÿ Clarifying success in terms of outcomes and behaviors aligned to the organization goals.
- Ÿ Frequent check-in and �exibility to change the goals anytime.
- Ÿ Continuous, real time feedback moving away from assessments to development.
- Ÿ Clear feedback on performance against goals and behaviors demonstrated

Digitization of the people processes is a key focus area. We have digitized processes across the employee lifecycle which include joining assistance, on-boarding, internal hiring, employee referrals, learning and compensation processes. This has resulted in reducing turn-around times and enhanced employee experience.

In the new normal, there is also a need to gauge employee engagement in real time. To enable this, we launched 'Heartbeat' our internal engagement platform that measures engagement levels on an everyday basis across di�erent dimensions. Findings from the �rst cycle of Heartbeat indicated that 92% of employees were ready to put in discretionary e�ort for the organization and 82% would recommend Dr. Reddy's as a great place to work. 87% to 89% valued the employee wellness, safety and respect that the organization provided.

With the acquisition of select business of Wockhardt Limited, we successfully integrated the related sales and marketing teams, as well as the manufacturing plant

located in Baddi. During these times, we focused on virtual on-boarding, training and induction. Cultural assimilation sessions focused on people and organization processes were conducted by leaders to enable seamless integration between teams.

We continue to strengthen our talent processes through cadre and capability building interventions. Signi�cant work was done in strengthening the capability building agenda in the organization. Employees were assessed against functional and behavioral skills required for them to be more e�ective in their roles. As part of developing future ready talent, strategic interventions have been designed in areas of digital and analytics. Learning journeys focused on competency building across speci�c cohorts were rolled out examples being in marketing and business development. We also invested in strengthening our learning resources to be more contemporary and set up a digital infrastructure in the form of a Learning Experience Platform.

To promote internal talent mobility, we launched 'growth bridges' that provide employees structured assignments and experiences equipping them to take on vertical and lateral growth opportunities.

Diversity and inclusion continues to remain important in the organizational agenda. 'Chrysalis', our �agship leadership development program, has been launched for women in middle management to prepare them for senior leadership roles.

For the fourth year in a row, we have been featured in the 2021 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for our commitment to st gender equality. We also won the 1 Runner up position in the 'Leadership' category (individual) in UN WEP awards.

## DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION

In FY2021, we continued to make progress on our digital transformation journey, which is structured along the lines of Digitalize the Core and Transform with Digital.

## Digitalize the Core:

We continued to simplify and digitalize our core business processes across the organization and ended the year with nearly 80% digitalization of all core business processes.

We expanded the digital footprint into regulatory and clinical processes resulting in faster cycle time and lower error rates. In manufacturing, we continued to expand implementation and adoption of the Manufacturing Execution System and the Laboratory Information Management Systems which result in paperless shop�oor and labs, eliminates errors and improves productivity. We also digitalized safety processes and equipment lifecycle management across the plants.

In branded markets, our digitalization e�orts have been focused on increasing �eld productivity with improved accuracy of doctors information enriched with geocodes critical for route and call planning. Within B2B markets, digitalization of bid and tender management processes have resulted in higher win rates, improved pricing vis-à-vis pro�tability and maintaining product market share.

We extended our digital footprint to enable two major cross-functional value chain processes: 'Selection to Launch' and 'Product Management'. The 'Selection to Launch' platform digitalizes all core processes involved across R&D, manufacturing and supply chain leading up to the new product launch. The 'Product Management' platform helps facilitate a 360 degree view along the product lifecycles through internal KPIs as well as market intelligence.

## Transform with Digital:

We continued to deploy digital and analytics solutions to improve customer engagement and drive speed and productivity in our value chain.

Within R&D, multiple digital solutions were deployed that drove reduction in cycle time of drug development and help improve our rate of being '�rst time right'.

Within manufacturing, we are building Digital Lighthouse plants to increase plant productivity. These initiatives have markedly reduced Cost of Poor Quality (COPQ) and

per pack costs. Higher productivity is also enabled by scaling up of Robotic Process Automation (RPAs) as well as digitalized processes with automated incident tracking and near zero manual errors.

Market facing digital transformations are focused on improving customer and patient engagement. We had invested in Omnichannel connect platforms for our customers that helped us when the pandemic hit us. Similarly, in the B2B businesses, digital solutions have been deployed to drive improved customer service and account management. We have also deployed advanced analytics-based insights to improve productivity of sales and marketing.

Few experiments have been underway to establish new patient engagement platforms - e.g., for an integrated end-toend care management for cancer patients as well as to look at adjacent business models in the healthcare ecosystem.

## COVID-19 RELATED PRODUCTS

We have continued to play our role in the �ght against COVID-19 by acting proactively to bring multiple preventive and curative treatment options, including a vaccine. Some of our major COVID-19 products are:

- Ÿ Sputnik V vaccine: We partnered with The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia's sovereign wealth fund, for conducting clinical trials and distribution of Sputnik V vaccine in India. We successfully completed Phase III trial for the vaccine, which demonstrated e�cacy at 91.6%, consistent safety and immunogenicity results. In April 2021 we received the Government of India's approval for emergency use of Sputnik-V in India. We have launched Sputnik V in May 2021.
- Ÿ Remdesivir: We signed a licensing agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. that grants Dr. Reddy's the right to register, manufacture and sell Remdesivir, a potential treatment for COVID-19, in 127 countries including India. We launched Remdesivir under the brand name "Redyx ™ " in India in September 2020. With the surge of COVID-19 cases in the second wave, we ramped-up our capacities to increase the availability of the medicine.
- Ÿ ® Avigan (Favipiravir): We entered into a licensing agreement with Fuji�lm Toyama Chemical Co. Ltd. to develop, sell and ® distribute Avigan (Favipiravir) in all countries other than Japan, China and ® Russia. This enabled us to launch Avigan 200 mg tablets in India and few other markets. We are also conducting Phase III trials in North America for outpatient setting with mild to moderate symptoms.
- Ÿ 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG™) : The 2-DG has been developed by Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO), in collaboration with Dr. Reddy's. The drug received emergency use as adjunct therapy for hospitalized moderate to severe COVID-19 patients.

In addition to these, we are also working on Molnupiravir, Baricitinib and several other COVID-19 drugs for treatment ranging from mild to severe conditions. We are committed to do our best in this pandemic situation.

## OUTLOOK, INCLUDING COVID-19

FY2021 started with multiple COVID-19 related disruptions with lockdowns in several of our major markets. This impacted the physical connect of doctors with patients and pharma representatives and also led to several challenges on operations, supply chain and logistics. Some of these challenges continued throughout the year.

We rose to the occasion with proactive measures such as leveraging digital channels for many of our operations examples being the enabling remote working for our employees and digitally connecting with doctors and business partners.

We managed to continue with most of our manufacturing operations through the year and ensured that supplies were available for each of our markets. We worked with innovative solutions ensuring business continuity; and while doing so we ensured the health and safety of our employees and business partners. We also converted the challenge to an opportunity with multiple set of COVID-19 related products.

The pricing pressures in the US, Europe and certain emerging markets have continued. However, our strong performance was led by volume growth and new product launches across these markets. Having said that, some delays in launch of a few key products hampered further growth.

Our commitment towards quality is re�ected in all our facilities being fully compliant with the respective regulatory agencies' regulations.

We remain focused on improving our market share position and continue our journey towards creating a leaner business model, leveraging productivity improvement, cost control and increased e�ciencies across several functions in FY2021.

Simultaneously, we are committed to investing in business to make it even more competitive and future ready, especially

through: (i) investments in digitalization; (ii) development of complex products and biosimilars; and (iii) strengthening sales and marketing activities in branded markets. These initiatives will continue in FY2022, as well, and thus provide necessary impetus to our performance in future years.

We will remain focused on patient centric product innovation, operational excellence, continuous improvement and attaining leadership in chosen spaces. We are committed to look for opportunities aligned with our future business strategies for inorganic growth. This is re�ected in select brand acquisition from Wockhardt and other small scale acquisitions during FY2021. We will continue to seek more such opportunities in future.

The last few months have seen a second wave of COVID-19 impacting several parts of the world, and the most in India. While vaccinations and several treatment options are now available, rapid spread of the infection has led to further uncertainties in terms of business outlook. Consequently, our overall business growth may remain volatile in FY2022.

However, we believe that we have enough levers of growth in terms of expanding our market share, new product launches, scale up of several businesses and opportunities arising from COVID-19 products. These should enable us to deliver satisfactory performance in FY2022.

## CORPORATE GOVERNANCE

Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ('Dr. Reddy's' or 'the company') believes that timely disclosures, transparent accounting policies coupled with a strong and independent board go a long way in maintaining good corporate governance, preserving shareholders' trust and maximizing long-term corporate value. The company's corporate governance framework is based on the following main principles:

- · Appropriate composition, diversity and size of the board, with each director bringing in key expertise in di�erent areas.
- · Proactive �ow of accurate information to members of the board and board committees to enable e�ective discharge of �duciary duties.
- · Ethical business conduct by the board, management and employees.
- · Well-developed systems of internal controls, risk management and �nancial reporting.
- · Protection and facilitation of shareholders' rights.
- · Adequate, timely and accurate disclosure of all material operational and �nancial information to stakeholders.

In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) regulates corporate governance for listed companies through SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (Listing Regulations). We are in full compliance with all the applicable provisions of SEBI's corporate governance norms. We are also in compliance with the appropriate corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (NYSE) and NSE IFSC Exchange Rules.

This chapter, together with information given in the chapters on Management Discussion and Analysis and Additional Shareholders' Information, constitute our report on corporate governance for 2020-21 (or FY2021).

## BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPOSITION

As on March 31, 2021, our board had 10 directors, comprising of (i) two executive directors, including the chairman of the board, and (ii) eight independent directors as de�ned under the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"), the Listing Regulations and the Corporate Governance Guidelines of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Their detailed pro�les are available on the company's website: www.drreddys.com/ourstory/leadership/board-of-directors/

The directors have expertise in the �elds of strategy, management and governance, �nance, operations, science, technology and human resources. Such expertise enables the board to steer the company in the right direction.

Table 1 gives details of their individual competence, expertise and skills.

The board provides leadership, strategic guidance, objective and independent views to the company's management while discharging its �duciary responsibilities, thereby ensuring that the management adheres to high standards of ethics, transparency and disclosure. It regularly reviews the company's governance, risk and compliance framework, business plans, and organization structure to align with the highest global standards.

## TABLE 1 | MATRIX OF BOARD EXPERTISE

Each director informs the company on an annual basis about the board and board committee positions she/he occupies in other companies, and noti�es it of any changes regarding their directorships and committee positions. In addition, the independent directors provide an annual con�rmation that they meet the criteria of independence as de�ned under Indian laws. Pursuant to a noti�cation dated October 22, 2019, issued by the Ministry of Corporate A�airs, all independent directors have completed the registration with the independent directors databank. Requisite disclosures have been received from the directors in this regard. After assessment of such disclosures, declarations and con�rmations, the board has opined that all the independent directors ful�l the conditions speci�ed under Listing Regulations and are independent of the management.

## TERM OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP

On recommendations of the nomination, governance and compensation committee (NGCC), the board considers the appointment and reappointment of directors.

Section 149(10) of the Act, provides that an independent director shall hold office up to �ve consecutive years on the board of a company from the date of appointment and shall be eligible for reappointment for a second term of up to �ve consecutive years on passing of a special resolution by the members. Moreover, independent directors cannot retire by rotation.

Table 2 gives the composition of our board, with all relevant details.

- * Term ended on May 10, 2021, as a director.

During FY2021, the members of the company approved the continuation of directorship of Mr. Prasad R Menon (DIN: 00005078), independent director on attaining the age of 75 years under Regulation 17(1A) of the Listing Regulations.

Additionally, members of the company approved the reappointment of Mr. G V Prasad (DIN: 00057433), as wholetime director, designated as co-chairman and managing director of the company for a further period of �ve years with e�ect from January 30, 2021.

Section 152 of the Act, states that onethird of the board members, other than independent directors, who are subject to retire by rotation, shall do so every year and be eligible for reappointment, if approved by the members. Accordingly, Mr. G V Prasad (DIN: 00057433) retires by rotation at the forthcoming annual general meeting (AGM) and being eligible, seeks reappointment.

Therefore, at the forthcoming annual general meeting, approval of members is being sought for the reappointment of Mr. G V Prasad, who retires by rotation and, being eligible, o�ers himself for the reappointment.

## SELECTION AND APPOINTMENT OF NEW DIRECTORS

Recommending any new member on the board is the responsibility of the NGCC of the board, which consists entirely of independent directors. Given the existing composition of the board, the tenure as well as the years left of the existing members to serve on the board, and the need for new domain expertise are reviewed by this committee. When such a need becomes apparent, the committee reviews potential candidates in terms of their expertise, attributes, personal and professional backgrounds and their ability to attend meetings in India. It then places the details of shortlisted candidates to the board for its consideration. If the board approves, the person is appointed as an additional director, subject to the approval of members in the company's next general meeting.

## FAMILIARIZATION PROCESS FOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS

To familiarize a new independent director with the company, an information kit is provided containing documents about the company. It contains, inter alia , information such as its annual reports, sustainability

reports, investor presentations, recent press releases, research reports, code of business conduct and ethics (COBE) and the memorandum and articles of association and a brief on company's board practices. The new independent director individually meets with board members and senior management. Visits to plants and research locations are organized for the director to understand the company's operations.

We believe that the board should be continuously empowered with knowledge of latest developments a�ecting the company and the industry. Apart from regular presentations on the company's business strategies and associated risks, expositions are made on various topics covering the pharmaceutical industry. Updates on relevant statutory changes and judicial pronouncements around industryrelated laws are regularly circulated to the directors. They also visit the company's manufacturing and research locations. Each director has complete access to any of the company's information and full freedom to interact with senior management.

## LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

Upon their appointment, independent directors are given a formal appointment letter containing, inter alia , the terms of appointment, roles, functions, duties and responsibilities, the company's code of conduct, disclosures and con�dentiality. For such terms and conditions, see: www.drreddys.com/investor/governance/ policies-and-documents/terms-conditiondirectors.html

## BOARD EVALUATION

Since FY2015, the board has carried out an annual self-evaluation of its performance, the working of its committees and peer evaluation of each director internally. Prior to that, on two such occasions, an independent expert was engaged to conduct the evaluation process. In FY2019, an independent expert was engaged to conduct the evaluation process and in FY2020 the evaluation and e�ectiveness process of the board, its committees and individual directors was undertaken internally.

During FY2021, also the evaluation process was undertaken internally. For the purpose, each director completed a questionnaire involving peer evaluation and feedback on processes of the board and its committees. The contribution and impact of individual members were evaluated on a number of parameters, such as level of engagement, independence of judgment, con�ict resolution, contributions to enhance the board's overall e�ectiveness, etc. Peer ratings on certain parameters, positive attributes and improvement areas for each director were provided to them on a con�dential basis.

The committees were evaluated on various parameters such as e�ective discharge of their roles, responsibilities and advice given to the board for discharging its �duciary responsibilities, including adequate and periodical updates to the board on the committees' functioning.

The audit committee comprises entirely of independent directors. All members are �nancially literate and bring in expertise in the �elds of �nance, economics, strategy and management. The committee comprises Mr. Sridar Iyengar (chairman), Ms. Kalpana Morparia and Ms. Shikha Sharma.

Under the Indian laws, the audit committee must meet at least four times in a year, with a maximum gap of 120 days between two meetings. The audit committee met seven times during the year: on May 19, 2020, July 29, 2020, August 17, 2020, October 27, 2020, January 28, 2021, February 11, 2021, and March 24, 2021. It also met the key members of the �nance team and chief internal auditor along with the chairman and the CFO to discuss matters relating to audit, assurance and accounting.

During the year, the committee also met representatives of statutory auditors without the presence of the management.

In addition, the chairman of the committee and other members met to review other processes, particularly the internal control mechanisms to prepare for certi�cation under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, 2002, and subsidiary governance oversight.

The chairman, CFO and the chief internal auditor (CIA) are permanent invitees to all the audit committee meetings. The representatives of statutory auditors are also present. The company secretary o�ciates as the secretary of the committee.

Audit committee meetings are preceded by pre-audit committee conference calls with the members, the CFO, the CCO, the internal audit and compliance teams, external auditors and other key �nance personnel of the company. During these calls, key audit related matters are discussed and items that need further face-to-face discussion at the audit committee meetings are identi�ed.

The internal and statutory auditors of the company discuss their �ndings and updates, and submit their views to the committee. Separate discussions are held with the internal auditors to focus on compliance issues and to conduct detailed reviews of the processes and internal controls in the company. Permissible nonaudit related services undertaken by the statutory and independent auditors are also pre-approved by the committee.

The audit committee also reviews the performance and remuneration of the CIA and chief compliance o�cer (CCO).

## NOMINATION, GOVERNANCE AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE

## COBE AND VIGIL MECHANISM

We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics ('COBE' or the 'Code') which applies to all directors and employees of the company, its subsidiaries and a�liates.

The directors and the employees across the company annually a�rm compliance with the code.

A declaration of the CEO of the company to this e�ect is enclosed as Exhibit 7 to this chapter.

The company has an ombudsperson policy (whistle-blower or vigil mechanism) to report concerns on actual or suspected violations of the code. The audit committee chairperson is the chief ombudsperson. Concerns raised to the company and their resolution are reported through the chief ombudsperson to the audit committee and where applicable, to the board. During FY2021, no personnel has been denied access to the audit committee on ombudsperson issues.

The COBE and ombudsperson policy are available on the company's website: www.drreddys.com/investors/governance/ code-of-business-conduct-and-ethicscobe/ and www.drreddys.com/investors/ governance/ombudsperson-policy

## RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

We have adequate procedures to identify and monitor related party transactions. All transactions with related parties are placed before the audit committee and the board for review and approval, as appropriate. Transactions entered into with related parties during the �nancial year were at arm's length pricing and generally in the ordinary course of business. The details of related party transactions are discussed in note 2.23 to the standalone �nancial statements. The company's policy on materiality of the related party transactions is available on the company's website: www.drreddys.com/media/764069/policymateriality-related-party-transactions.pdf

Interested directors are not present during discussion and voting on such related party transactions. Furthermore, the transactions with directors/their relatives/ entities outside our group in which they are interested, are reviewed by an independent chartered accountant.

## SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES

The audit committee reviews the �nancial statements of our subsidiaries. It also reviews the investments made by such subsidiaries, the statement of all signi�cant transactions and arrangements entered into by subsidiaries and the compliances of each materially signi�cant subsidiary on a periodic basis.

The audit committee also reviews the utilization of loans/advances/investments given by the company to its subsidiaries.

The company has also established a group governance policy for monitoring the governance of its subsidiaries.

## MANAGEMENT

Our management develops and implements policies, procedures and practices that attempt to translate the company's core purpose and mission into reality.

## PROHIBITION OF INSIDER TRADING

We have a policy prohibiting insider trading in conformity with applicable regulations of the SEBI in India and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of the USA. Necessary procedures have been laid down for directors, o�cers, designated persons and their relatives for trading in the securities of the company. These are periodically communicated to such employees who are considered as insiders of the company. Apart from this, regular insider trading awareness sessions are conducted for the bene�t of designated persons. Trading window closure/blackouts/ quiet periods, when the directors and designated persons are not permitted to trade in the securities of the company, are intimated in advance to all concerned. Violations of the policy, if any,

are appropriately acted on and reported to the SEBI/SEs. The company also maintains a structured digital database, as required under the SEBI (Prohibition of Insider Trading) Regulations, 2015.

## INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND STATUTORY AUDITS

We have both external and internal audit systems in place. Auditors have access to all records and information of the company. The board recognizes the work of the auditors as an independent check on the information received from the management on the operations and performance of the company. The board periodically reviews the �ndings and recommendations of the statutory and internal auditors and suggests corrective actions whenever necessary.

## INTERNAL CONTROLS

We maintain a system of internal controls designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories:

- · Organization's strategic objective;
- · E�ectiveness and e�ciency of operations;
- · Adequacy of safeguards for assets;
- · Reliability of �nancial and non-�nancial reporting; and

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 46 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act"), read with Rule 6(2)(a) of the Companies (Share Capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014, duplicate share certificates, in lieu of those that are lost or destroyed, should only be issued with the prior consent of the board. Therefore, based on circular no. 19/2014 dated June 12, 2014, issued by the Ministry of Corporate A�airs, and consequent to delegation of power of issuing duplicate share certi�cates by the board of directors to the stakeholders' relationship committee, the committee attends to such requests at regular intervals.

## PROCEDURE FOR POSTAL BALLOT

In compliance with the Listing Regulations and Sections 108, 110 and other applicable provisions of the Act, read with applicable Rules, the company provides e-voting

facility to all its shareholders, to enable them to cast their votes electronically. The company engages the services of NSDL for the purpose of providing such e-voting facility to all its shareholders. The shareholders have the option to vote either by physical ballot or e-voting.

## BOARD'S REPORT

Dear Member,

Your directors are pleased to present the 37th annual report for the year ended March 31, 2021.

The �nancial year 2021 started with COVID-19 related lockdowns in India and several parts of our major markets. The pandemic which started about 15 months back impacted almost everyone and your company was no exception. There were challenges around movement of people and all the business operations were impacted - be it manufacturing, research and development (R&D), marketing or the supply chain and logistics. Our team accepted the situation as a challenge and solved the issues one by one to ensure that your company continues to make medicines and serve its patients across the globe.

We also collaborated with multiple global partners and have been developing a number of COVID-19 related drugs. We have successfully launched a vaccine.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Members of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited

## Report on the Audit of the Standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

## Opinion

We have audited the accompanying standalone Ind AS �nancial statements of Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited ("the Company"), which comprise the Balance sheet as at 31 March 2021, the Statement of Pro�t and Loss, including the statement of Other Comprehensive the Cash Flow Statement and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and notes to the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements, including a summary of signi�cant accounting policies and other explanatory information.

In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone Ind AS �nancial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013, as amended ("the Act") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of a�airs of the Company as at 31 March 2021, its pro�t including other comprehensive income, its cash �ows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date.

## Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audit of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs), as speci�ed under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the 'Code of Ethics' issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the �nancial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have ful�lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su�cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements.

## Key audit matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi�cance in our audit of the standalone Ind �nancial statements for the �nancial year ended 31 March 2021. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.

We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. We have ful�lled the responsibilities described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying standalone Ind AS �nancial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Business transfer agreement with Wockhardt Limited (as described in note 1.3(d) o� t�e si�ni�cant acco�ntin� �olicies and note �.3� o� t�e standalone Ind A� �nancial state�ents)

During the current year, the Company completed the acquisition of select divisions of the branded generics business of Wockhardt Limited in India and the territories of Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and Maldives. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. The Company's accounting for the acquisition included determining the fair value of the assets acquired, which primarily included product related intangibles. In connection with the acquisition, the Company recognized a contingent consideration liability for acquisition consideration that is payable based on a multiple of incremental revenue targets subject to a maximum amount.

The accounting for the business combination was complex due to the signi�cant estimation required by management to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and the contingent consideration. The signi�cant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying assumptions utilized in the measurement of the fair value of the intangible assets and contingent consideration. The Company used a discounted cash �ow model to measure the fair value of the intangible assets, which included signi�cant assumptions such as the discount rate, useful life, and long-term growth rate. The Company measured the contingent consideration at its estimated fair value, and the signi�cant assumptions used to determine the fair value of contingent consideration included forecasted revenue projections, revenue volatility and a risk adjusted discount rate. Considering the above, this has been included as a Key Audit Matter.

Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- Ÿ We evaluated the design and tested the operating e�ectiveness of the controls over the Company's calculation of the estimated fair values of the intangible assets and the contingent consideration.
- Ÿ We assessed the competence and independence of the third-party valuer by reference to their quali�cations and experience.
- Ÿ We tested the estimated fair value of the intangible assets and the contingent consideration liability, evaluated Company's selected valuation methods and tested the signi�cant assumptions used in the models. In testing the valuation of contingent consideration, we assessed, among others, the terms of the arrangement and the conditions met for the amounts to become payable.
- Ÿ We compared the signi�cant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, assumptions used to value similar assets, and to the historical results of the acquired business.
- Ÿ We involved valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model, key assumptions used in the valuation models and to test the model's computational accuracy.
- Ÿ We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
- Ÿ We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the model.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Assessment of carrying value of intangible assets, intangible assets under development and goodwill (as described in note 1.3(f) and 1.3(i) of the signi�cant accounting policies� and note �.�� �.3 and �.� for details and movement in good�ill� other intangible assets and intangible assets under development respectively in the standalone Ind A� �nancial statements)

As at 31 March 2021, the Company has intangible assets, including intangible assets under development, of Rs. 22,035 million and goodwill of Rs. 853 million. The carrying value of these intangible assets are based on future cash flows and there is a risk that the assets may be impaired if cash flows are not in line with projections.

Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to management's assessment of recoverable amount, being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell, involving signi�cant judgment and are based on number of variables and estimates including projection of future sales, operating costs and pro�t margins; appropriate discount rate and terminal value growth rate; and probability of technical and regulatory success factors in applying discounted cash �ow valuation methodology. As the assessment of recoverable amount involves signi�cant degree of management judgement, we have identi�ed this a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- Ÿ We evaluated the design and tested the operating e�ectiveness of the Company's controls in assessing the recoverable value of goodwill, intangible assets and intangible assets under development.
- Ÿ We assessed the Company's methodology applied in determining the CGUs to which these assets are allocated.
- Ÿ We tested the estimated recoverable value of these assets and assessed the methodologies used by management in deriving the recoverable value and tested the signi�cant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses.
- Ÿ We compared the signi�cant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, to the Company's historical data.
- Ÿ We performed sensitivity analyses of the signi�cant assumptions to evaluate the potential change in the recoverable values of these assets resulting from hypothetical changes in underlying assumptions. We also assessed the recoverable value headroom by performing sensitivity testing of key assumptions used.
- Ÿ We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
- Ÿ We involved valuation specialist to assist in evaluating the methodologies used and signi�cant assumptions and inputs used to determine the recoverable value of certain intangible assets.

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(k) of the signi�cant accounting policies� and note �.�� (A) containing details of contingencies in the standalone Ind A� �nancial statements)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case- to-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation.

This area is signi�cant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the di�culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements.

## Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- Ÿ We evaluated the design and tested the operating e�ectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at di�erent levels in the Company, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.
- Ÿ We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Company's in-house legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We compared the evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements. We tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- Ÿ We obtained legal letters from the Company's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate, we examined correspondences connected with the cases.
- Ÿ We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities.
- Ÿ We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of material indirect tax positions and assessed the technical merits based on the correspondence and assessments from the relevant tax authorities.
- Ÿ We also evaluated the disclosures made in the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements.

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Rebates, discounts and other deductions in Revenue (as described in note 1.3(�� o� t�e si�ni�cant acco�ntin� �o�icies o� standa�one �nd �� �nancia� state�ents and note �.1� o� t�e standa�one �nd �� �nancia� state�ents�

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for chargeback, rebates, sales returns and discounts, etc. The estimates relating to the accruals are important given the significance of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- Ÿ We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating e�ectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes.
- Ÿ We also tested management's controls over the accuracy and completeness of the estimates used to calculate the sales deductions.
- Ÿ We tested management's estimated sales deductions and obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates. We tested management's estimates over the determination of sales deductions accruals by comparing the rates used in management's estimate to rates in the underlying contracts and historical sales deductions data.
- Ÿ We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, as applicable to current payment trends.
- Ÿ We also considered the historical accuracy of the management's estimates in prior years and assessed the estimated amounts, we evaluated trends in actual sales and discount accrual balances.
- Ÿ We also tested the underlying data used in management's calculations for accuracy and completeness and veri�ed source data supporting the inventory levels, rebate claims paid subsequent to period end, and volume discounts settled during the period.
- Ÿ We tested recording of revenue in appropriate period which included the following procedures:
- Ÿ Performed trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous periods;
- Ÿ Veri�ed sample sales transactions near period-end.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone Ind AS Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in�uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone Ind AS �nancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Ÿ Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su�cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Ÿ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal �nancial controls with reference to �nancial statements in place and the operating e�ectiveness of such controls.
- Ÿ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Ÿ Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi�cant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the �nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Ÿ Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi�cant audit �ndings, including any signi�cant de�ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi�cance in the audit of the standalone Ind AS �nancial statements for the �nancial year ended 31 March 2021 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene�ts of such communication.

Securities premium reserve is used to record the premium on issue of shares. The reserve is utilised in accordance with the provisions of Section 52 of the C ompanies Act, 2013. The general reserve is a free reserve which is used from time to time to transfer pro�ts from retained earnings for appropriation purposes. As the general reser ve is created by a transfer from one component of equity to another and is not an item of other comprehensive income, items included in the general reserve will not be reclassi�ed subsequently to statement of pro�t and loss. Pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018, the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") was formed to support the Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 by acquiring, including through secondary market acquisitions, equity shares which are used for issuance to eligible employees upon exercise of stock options thereunder.

This reserve represents mark to market gain or loss on �nancial assets classi�ed as F�TOCI. Depending on the category and type of the �nancial asset, the mark to market gain or loss is either reclassi�ed to statement of pro�t and loss or retained earnings upon disposal of the investment.

All assets and liabilities have been classi�ed as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.

## Assets:

An asset is classi�ed as current when it satis�es any of the following criteria:

- Ÿ it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- Ÿ it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- Ÿ it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- Ÿ it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

- Ÿ it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- Ÿ it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- Ÿ it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- Ÿ the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## 1.3 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Ÿ

## a) New Standards adopted by the Company

On 24 July 2020, the Ministry of Corporate A�airs (MCA) has issued amendments to certain Ind AS as summarised below:

## Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8: Denition of Material

The amendments provided a new de�nition to the word material as follows:

'Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to in�uence decisions t�at t�e primary users of general-purpose �nancial statements ma�e on t�e basis of t�ose �nancial statements, ��ic� pro�ide �nancial information about a speci�c reporting entity.'

The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the �nancial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to in�uence decisions made by the primary users.

An information is considered to be obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar e�ect for primary users of �nancial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The amendments provided examples of circumstances that may result in information being obscured.

An entity should apply the amendments prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020.

The amendments to the de�nition of material had no impact on the �nancial statements of the Company.

## Amendments to Ind AS 103: Denition of a Business

The amendments clari�ed the de�nition of a business for the purpose of identifying a business combination under Ind AS 103. As per the revised de�nition, business is 'an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities'.

A related amendment has been made to the de�nition of 'output' as an element of business.

The amendments include an election to use a 'concentration test'. This is a simpli�ed assessment that would cause an acquisition to qualify as an asset acquisition. The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identi�able asset or a group of similar identi�able assets.

An entity is required to apply the amendments to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the �rst annual reporting period beginning on or after the 1 April 2020 and to asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period.

This amendment had no impact on the �nancial statements of the Company but may impact future periods should the Company enter into any business combinations.

## Amendments to Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform

The amendments to Ind AS 109 " Financial Instruments " provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly a�ected by interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is a�ected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash �ows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The amendments to Ind AS 107 " Financial Instruments: Disclosures " prescribe the disclosures which entities are required to make for hedging relationships to which the reliefs as per the amendments in Ind AS 109 are applied.

These amendments are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after the 1 April 2020.

These amendments had no impact on the �nancial statements of the Company as it does not have any interest rate hedge relationships.

## Amendments Ind AS 116: COVID-19 related rent concessions

Ind AS 116 has been amended to provide limited relief to lessees in respect of rent concessions arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. No relief has been allowed to the lessors.

The amendments provide a practical expedient that lessees may elect to not treat any rent concessions, provided by lessors as a direct consequence of COVID-19 pandemic, as lease modi�cations. �owever, to be eligible for this relief:

- Ÿ the revised consideration for the lease should be less than or equal to the lease consideration immediately before the change, the rent concession should be for a period that does not extend beyond 30 June 2021 (for example, lease rents are reduced for a period upto 30 June 2021 and increased for periods thereafter); and
- Ÿ there should be no substantial modi�cation to the other terms and conditions of the lease.

Lessee should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020. In case a lessee has not yet approved the �nancial statements for issue before the issuance of the amendments, then the same may be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after the 1 April 2019.

The aforesaid amendments had no impact on the �nancial statements of the Company.

## For the year ended 31 March, 2020

Ind AS 116, "Leases"

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate A�airs (MCA) noti�ed Ind AS 116, Leases as part of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases with e�ect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and �nance leases. Lessor accounting, however, remains largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and �nance leases is retained.

Impact of the implementation of Ind AS 116 on the Company:

The Company adopted Ind AS 116 e�ective as of 01 April 2019. Ind AS 116, " Leases " changed the financial statements of the Company as the majority of leases for which the Company is the lessee became on-balance sheet liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets also recognised on the Balance sheet. The lease liability re�ects the net present value of the remaining lease payments adjusted for payments made before the commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement, and the right-of-use asset corresponds to the lease liability.

Upon adoption of the new standard, a portion of the annual operating lease costs, which was previously fully recognised as a rental / lease expense, is recorded as interest expense. In addition, the portion of the lease payments which represents the reduction of the lease liability is recognised in the statement of cash �ows as an out�ow from �nancing activities, which was previously fully recognised as an out�ow from operating activities.

The Company implemented the new standard on 1 April 2019, and applied the modi�ed retrospective method, with right-of-use assets measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to those leases recognised in the balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application and will not restate prior years.

The Company elected to use the transition practical expedient that allows the standard to be applied only to contracts previously identi�ed under Ind AS 17, " Leases " and the contracts assessed using the guidance available under Appendix -C to Ind AS 17, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease".

The Company also elected to use the recognition exemption for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option ("short-term leases") and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value ("low value assets").

On 1 April 2019, the Company recognised lease liabilities of 332 (presented as part of borrowings) and right-of-use assets of 332 ₹ ₹ (presented as part of Property, plant and equipment).

Consequently, the Company has recognised an amount of 173 in depreciation expense and 60 in �nance costs for the year ended ₹ ₹ 31 March 2020.

Adoption of the new standard had no impact upon leases for which the Company is a lessor.

Appendix C to Ind AS 12, "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments"

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate A�airs (MCA) made certain amendments to Ind AS 12, Income taxes by including Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. This appendix clari�es how the recognition and measurement requirements of Ind AS 12 are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. It does not apply to taxes or levies outside the scope of Ind AS 12, nor does it speci�cally include requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax treatments.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Appendix C explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the applicable tax authority. For example, a decision to claim a deduction for a speci�c expense or not to include a speci�c item of income in a tax return is an uncertain tax treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under applicable The interpretation provides speci�c guidance in several areas where previously Ind AS 1� was silent. Appendix C applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable pro�t or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.

The Company applied the interpretation e�ective 1 April ��1� using the modi�ed retrospective approach. The adoption of Appendix C did not have any material impact on the �nancial statements of the Company.

## b) Foreign currency

Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange di�erences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates di�erent from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous �nancial statements are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency di�erences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- Ÿ certain debt instruments classi�ed as measured at FVTOCI;
- Ÿ certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value;
- Ÿ a �nancial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is e�ective; and
- Ÿ qualifying cash �ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are e�ective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash �ows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash �ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## c) Financial instruments

A �nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a �nancial asset of one entity and a �nancial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

All �nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of �nancial assets not recorded at fair value through pro�t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the �nancial asset. Purchases or sales of �nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain signi�cant �nancing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any signi�cant �nancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers".

## Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, �nancial assets are classi�ed in four categories:

- Ÿ Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- Ÿ Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
- Ÿ Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
- Ÿ Equity instruments measured at fair value through FVTOCI.

## Debt instruments at amortised cost

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- Ÿ the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash �ows; and
- Ÿ contractual terms of the asset give rise on speci�ed dates to cash �ows that are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such �nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e�ective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the e�ective interest rate.

Interest income from these �nancial assets is included in �nance income using the e�ective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in statement of pro�t and loss and presented in other gains�(losses). The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classi�ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash �ows and selling the �nancial assets� and
- b) the asset's contractual cash �ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the OCI. However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of pro�t and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassi�ed to the statement of pro�t and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the e�ective interest rate method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classi�ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies are classi�ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair The Company makes such election on an instrument by-instrument basis. The classi�cation is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the statement of pro�t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, on sale the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss.

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture:

Investments in subsidiaries and joint venture are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable On disposal of investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, the di�erence between net disposal proceeds and the carrying amounts are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss.

Upon �rst-time adoption of Ind AS, the Company has elected to measure its investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures at the Previous GAAP carrying amount as its deemed cost on the date of transition to Ind AS i.e., 1 April 2015.

## Derecognition

A �nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a �nancial asset or part of a group of similar �nancial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's balance sheet) when:

- Ÿ the rights to receive cash �ows from the asset have expired� or
- Ÿ Both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash �ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash �ows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement� and (2) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash �ows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that re�ects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other �nancial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another �nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simpli�ed approach" for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simpli�ed approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

## Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classi�ed, at initial recognition, as �nancial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an e�ective hedge, as appropriate.

All �nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's �nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative �nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of �nancial liabilities depends on their classi�cation, as described below�

## Financial liabilities at FVTPL

near

term.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include �nancial liabilities held for trading and �nancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classi�ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the This category also includes derivative �nancial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as de�ned by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classi�ed as held for trading unless they are designated as e�ective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satis�ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains or losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the statement of pro�t and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss. The Company has not designated any �nancial liability as FVTPL.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any di�erence between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss over the period of the borrowings using the e�ective interest method.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e�ective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the e�ective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the e�ective interest rate. The e�ective interest rate amortisation is included as �nance costs in the statement of pro�t and loss.

## Derecognition

A �nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. �hen an existing �nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially di�erent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi�ed, such an exchange or modi�cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The di�erence in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss.

## Derivative �nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles Brazilian reals, South African rands ("ZAR"), Romanian new leus ("RON") and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, Ukrainian hryvnias and Euros.

The Company uses derivative �nancial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative �nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classi�ed as �nancial assets when the fair value is positive and as �nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classi�es its derivative �nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash �ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The e�ective portion of such cash �ow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classi�ed to the statement of pro�t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ine�ective portion of such cash �ow hedges is recorded in the statement of pro�t and loss as �nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative �nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash �ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative �nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassi�ed to the statement of pro�t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in OCI is recognised immediately in the statement of pro�t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the statement of pro�t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insigni�cant risk of changes in value. �or this purpose, �short-term� means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash �ows.

## d) Business combinations

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a�ect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together signi�cantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organized workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it signi�cantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without signi�cant cost, e�ort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the:

- Ÿ fair values of the assets transferred;
- Ÿ liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
- Ÿ equity interests issued by the Company;
- Ÿ fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
- Ÿ fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

Identi�able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Company recognizes any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquired entity's net identi�able assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

## The excess of the sum of:

- Ÿ the consideration transferred
- Ÿ the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and
- Ÿ the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity.

over the fair value of the net identi�able assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identi�able assets of the business acquired, the di�erence is recognized directly in the statement of pro�t and loss as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent �nancier under comparable terms and conditions.

is

not

Contingent consideration is classi�ed either as equity or a �nancial liability. Contingent consideration classi�ed as equity re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Amounts classi�ed as a �nancial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in the statement of pro�t and loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognized in the statement of pro�t and loss.

## e) Property, plant and equipment

## Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have di�erent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Selling and other expense, net" in the statement of pro�t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic bene�ts embodied within the part will �ow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| PARTICULARS                           | YEARS    |
|---------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                             |          |
| -Factory and administrative buildings | 20 to 30 |
| -Ancillary structures                 | 3 to 10  |
| Plant and equipment                   | 5 to 10  |
| Furniture, ��tures and o�ce equipment | 3 to 8   |
| Vehicles                              | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are di�erent from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible �xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

## f) Goodwill and other intangible assets

Recognition and measurement

| Goodwill                | Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of  non-controlling interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of  identi�able net assets acquired.                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                         | Goodwill is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity  accounted investees, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the  investment, and any impairment loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset,  including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying value of the equity accounted investee. |
| Other intangible assets | Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Company and that have �nite useful lives are  measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. The cost  of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of  acquisition.                                                                          |

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortisation expense is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| PARTICULARS                 | YEARS   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 15 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 5  |

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a �nite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date. Changes in the expected useful lives or expected pattern of consumption of future economic bene�ts embodied in the assets are considered to modify the amortization period or method, as appropriate and are treated as change in accounting estimate.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having inde�nite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the statement of pro�t and loss under "Impairment of non-current assets".

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic bene�ts are expected from their Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the statement of pro�t and loss, and are measured as the di�erence between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## g) Leases

As explained in note 1.3(a) above, the Company has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Company is the lessee. The new policy is described below. Refer note 1.3(a) for the impact of the change in accounting policy.

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identi�ed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognises a right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

- Ÿ �xed payments (including in-substance �xed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- Ÿ variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date
- Ÿ amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees
- Ÿ the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- Ÿ payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term re�ects the Company exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The Company's lease liabilities are included in borrowings.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of the following: Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to statement of pro�t and loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

- Ÿ the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- Ÿ any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- Ÿ any initial direct costs, and
- Ÿ restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in the the statement of pro�t and loss.. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 1� months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of o�ce furniture.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised on the balance sheet at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Company.

## h) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and �nished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of �nished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to re�ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## i) Impairment

Ÿ

## Non��nan�ia� assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-�nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have inde�nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as de�ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash �ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re�ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci�c to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash in�ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash in�ows of other assets or groups of assets (the �cash-generating unit�).

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to bene�t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated �rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

## j) Employee �ene�ts

## Short-term employee bene�ts

Short-term employee bene�ts are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## �e�ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to de�ned contribution plans are charged to the statement of pro�t and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## �e�ned bene�t plans

The liability in respect of de�ned bene�t plans and other post-employment bene�ts is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of quali�ed actuaries. The present value of the de�ned bene�t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out�ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the bene�ts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related de�ned bene�t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the de�ned bene�t plan, recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss in employee bene�t expense, re�ects the increase in the de�ned bene�t obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, bene�t changes, curtailments and settlements. �ast service costs are recognised immediately in the statement of pro�t and loss.

The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the de�ned bene�t obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee bene�t expense in the statement of pro�t and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for de�ned bene�t obligation and plan assets are recogni�ed in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the bene�ts under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in bene�t that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the statement of pro�t and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a de�ned bene�t plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## Termination bene�ts

Termination bene�ts are recognised as an expense in the statement of pro�t and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination bene�ts as a result of an o�er made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination bene�ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the statement of pro�t and loss if the Company has made an o�er encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the o�er will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee �ene�t�

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee bene�ts is the amount of future bene�t that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That bene�t is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a quali�ed actuary.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee bene�t expense, , in the statement of pro�t and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re�ect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re�ect the actual number of stock options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss.

## k) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an out�ow of economic bene�ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the e�ect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash �ows at a pre-tax rate that re�ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci�c to the liability. �here discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a �nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss when the expected bene�ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the speci�c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an out�ow of resources. �here there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of out�ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the �nancial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an in�ow of economic bene�ts is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an in�ow of economic bene�ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## l) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unful�lled obligations that could a�ect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates.

Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi�cant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

## Pro�t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a pro�t share which is over and above the base purchase price. The pro�t share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net pro�ts, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide con�rmation of units sold and net sales or net pro�t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the pro�t share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi�cant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and records revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred

## Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the di�erence between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to re�ect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition or otherwise. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better re�ect the current market The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not speci�cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be o�ered.

## Refund Liability

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of actual sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satis�ed. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## m) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

## n) Other income and �nance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss as it accrues, using the e�ective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash �ows are classi�ed as investing activities in the statement of cash �ows. Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss using the e�ective interest method. The associated cash �ows are classi�ed as �nancing activities in the statement of cash �ows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange di�erences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ine�ective portion of cash �ow hedges.

## o) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary di�erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for �nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary di�erences:

- Ÿ temporary di�erences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that a�ects neither accounting nor taxable pro�t;
- Ÿ temporary di�erences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- Ÿ taxable temporary di�erences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary di�erences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are o�set if there is a legally enforceable right to o�set current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on di�erent tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro�ts will be available against which the temporary di�erence can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax asset will be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that the future taxable pro�ts will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary di�erences in respect of unrealised inter-company pro�t or loss on inventories held by the Company in di�erent tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in OCI or directly in equity, respectively.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax bene�ts are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax bene�t and re�ects the e�ect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## p) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the pro�t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the pro�t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the e�ects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## q) Government grants and incentives

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the statement of pro�t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signi�cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## r) Treasury shares

instruments.

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in statement of pro�t and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity Any di�erence between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## s) Rounding of amounts

All amounts in Indian Rupees disclosed in the �nancial statements and notes have been rounded o� to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUES

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain �nancial and non-�nancialassets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes speci�c to that asset or liability

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-�nancial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic bene�ts by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which su�cient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the �nancial statements are categorized within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement as a whole�

- · Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognized in the �nancial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of signi�cant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and signi�cant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the Management, based on market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the bene�ts anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those bene�ts.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable pro�t margin based on the e�ort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash �ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the di�erence between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative �nancial liabilities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash �ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For �nance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have �oating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

## h) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on signi�cant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS ��3, " Fair Value Measurement " refers to as Level 3 inputs.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| PARTICULARS                          |   AS AT 31 MARCH 2021 |   AS AT 31 MARCH 2020 |

| Global Generics-Branded Formulations |                   853 |                   323 |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value-in-use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash �ows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash �ows. �ey assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash �ows for �ve years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash �ows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.
- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used is 10.5% for the cash generating unit. The pre-tax discount rate is 15.7%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on its trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another �nancial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers. The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 are as follows:

## Details of contract asset:

As mentioned in the accounting policies for refund liability set forth in note 1.3 (l) of these �nancial statements, the Company recognises an asset , (i.e., the right to the returned goods), which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

As on 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the Company had 37 and 23, respectively as contract assets representing the right to returned goods. ₹ ₹

The average market value of the Company's shares for the purpose of calculating the dilutive e�ect of stock options was based on quoted market prices for the year during which the options were outstanding.

## 2.24 EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Plan -2002 (the "DRL 2002 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of �ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., 5 per option). ₹

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

After the stock split e�ected in the form of a stock dividend issued by the Company in August 200�, the DRL 2002 Plan provides for stock option grants in the above two categories as follows:

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan"):

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and �ve years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of �ve years.

The DRL 2018 Plan provides for option grants having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant as follows:

## 2.24 EMPLOYEE STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS (CONTINUED)

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 was 1,255 and 994 per ₹ ₹ option, respectively. The weighted average share price on the date of exercise of options during the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 was 4,609 and 2,914 per share, respectively. ₹ ₹

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 was 165 and 0.35, respectively. ₹ ₹ As of 31 March 2021, options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of 563 and options exercisable had an aggregate intrinsic value of 104. ₹ ₹

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simpli�ed method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity. Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in e�ect at the time of the grant. These assumptions re�ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses di�erent assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

The weighted average inputs used in computing the fair value of options granted were as follows:

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary di�erences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the bene�ts of those recognised deductible di�erences and tax loss carry forwards.

Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates:

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

A net gain/loss of ₹ Nil, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash �ow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the foreign exchange gain and losses and �nance costs. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of statement of pro�t and loss, a net gain of 1�4 and a net gain of 3� for the year ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 respectively. ₹ ₹

The Company had outstanding cross currency swap against INR borrowing of ' 7,240 as at 31 March 2021 and ' Nil as on 31 March 2020. The swap hedges the principal repayment of underlying INR liability and transforms it into USD principal repayment liability.

## 2.28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of �nancial risks, including market risk, credit risk and li�uidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse e�ects of market risk on its �nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to re�ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The �oard of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash �ows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive �nancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (primarily in United States dollars, Russian roubles, U.K pounds sterling and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars). A signi�cant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a signi�cant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease.

## 2.28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to �uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative �nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency �nancial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.27 above.

In respect of the Company's forward contracts and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- Ÿ a 4,895/(4,267) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a 5,063/(5,063) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net pro�t ₹ ₹ from such contracts, as at 31 March 2021;
- Ÿ a 1,303/(1,837) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a 4,195/(4,246) increase/(decrease) in the Company's net pro�t ₹ ₹ from such contracts, as at 31 March 2020;

The following table analyses foreign currency risk from non-derivative �nancial instruments as at 31 March 2021:

For the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned �nancial assets/liabilities would a�ect the Company�s net pro�t by ' 5,897 and ' 4,400, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2021, the Company had loans with �oating interest rates as follows: ₹ 8,800 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill plus 30 bps. As of 31 March 2020, the Company had loans with �oating interest rates as follows: ₹ 10,215 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of 1 Month LIBOR plus 12.5 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps and ₹4,000 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of 1 Month India Treasury Bill plus 60 bps. These loans expose the Company to risk of changes in interest rates. The Company's treasury department monitors the interest rate movement and manages the interest rate risk based on its policies, which include entering into interest rate swaps as considered necessary.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate pro�les, refer note 2.9A and 2.9B of these �nancial statements.

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## 2.28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

For the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, every 10% increase or decrease in the �oating interest rate component (i.e., Treasury bill) applicable to its loans and borrowings would a�ect the Company's net pro�t by ₹ ₹ 29 and 27.

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings, interest component of which designated in a cash �ow hedge was ₹ Nil as of 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e, certi�cates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signi�cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may �uctuate signi�cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally �uctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2021, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to �uctuations in commodity prices.

## b. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of �nancial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a �nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is in�uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an in�uence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signi�cant concentration of exposures to speci�c industry sectors or speci�c country risks.

## Details of �nancial assets �not due� �ast due and im�aired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certi�cates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2021. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 -180 days.

The ageing of trade receivables is given below:

Refer note 2.5 B of these �nancial statements for the activity in the allowance for credit losses.

## Loans and advances

Loans and advances are predominantly given to subsidiaries for the purpose of working capital and other business requirements.

Refer note 2.5 C of these �nancial statements for the activity in the allowance for doubtful advances.

Other than trade receivables and loans and advances, the Company has no signi�cant class of �nancial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its �nancial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have su�cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ₹ 18,361 and₹ 20,743 respectively.

As at 31 March 2021, the Company had working capital of ₹ ₹ 63,839, including cash and cash equivalents of 13,063, investments in term deposits with banks (i.e., deposits having original maturities of more than 3 months) of 3,402, investments in bonds of 522, investment in commercial ₹ ₹ paper of Nil, investments in marked linked debentures of Nil and investments mutual funds of 12,048. ₹ ₹ ₹

## 2.29 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

## A. Contingent liabilities (claims against the Company not acknowledged as debts)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more signi�cant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is di�cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected �nancial e�ect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company based on internal and external legal advice discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plainti�s, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse e�ect on its �nancial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

## Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

1 R U ǁ R [ D F L Q , Q G L D O L W L J D W L R Q

The Company manufactures and distributes Nor�oxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient nor�oxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "speci�ed product" and �x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a noti�cation and designated Nor�oxacin as a "speci�ed product" and �xed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company �led a statutory �orm III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while �xing the maximum selling price.

The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company; however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company �led a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by �ling a Special �eave Petition.

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Nor�oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price �xed by the NPPA, which was 285 including interest. ₹

## NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and where otherwise stated)

## 2.29 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company �led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was 77. The Company deposited ₹ this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ₹ 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company �led an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Nor�oxacin as a "speci�ed product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA �led a counter a�davit stating that the inclusion of Nor�oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the �eld. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Nor�oxacin as a "speci�ed product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the �xing of prices for Nor�oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Nor�oxacin was �led by the Company with the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 29 July 2021 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the noti�ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain noti�cations regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, �led a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the noti�cations issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition �led by the IPA and upheld the validity of the noti�cations�orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA �led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the noti�ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA �led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application �led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, 13 December 2017, the IPA �led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had �led, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company �led a writ petition challenging the ₹ speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for 676. ₹ ₹

Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of 676 dated 15 September 2017 ₹ ₹ to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to �le a �nal counter a�davit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could �le a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter a�davit was �led by the Union of India. The Company subsequently �led a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 3 August 2021 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of 310 under "Selling and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale ₹ proceeds in excess of the noti�ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the noti�ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were �led against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plainti�s allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More speci�cally, the plainti�s allege that� (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

## 2.29 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plainti�s in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plainti�s' right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were �led against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part of a multi-district, multi product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to �x prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plainti�s agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company �led a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plainti�s �led opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was �led by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the �nancial statements of the Company.

## (ii) Civil litigation with Mezzion

On 13 January 2017, Mezzion Pharma Co. Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") �led a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States. The complaint pertains to the production and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") for udena�l (a patented compound) and an udena�l �nished dosage product during a period from calendar years 2007 to 2015. Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and �nished dosage forms of udena�l and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the �ling of a NDA for the product by Mezzion. The Company �led a motion to dismiss Mezzion's complaint on the technical grounds that the Court lacks jurisdiction over the Company. In January 2018, the Court denied the Company's motion to dismiss the complaint on the jurisdictional matter. The Company's interlocutory appeal of said denial was also denied. The case is continuing in pretrial discovery.

The Company denies any wrongdoing or liability in this regard, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in Mezzion's complaint. Any liability that may arise on account of this claim is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in the �nancial statements of the Company.

## (iii) Securities Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was �led against the Company, its Chief Executive O�cer and its Chief Financial O�cer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public �lings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws, and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were a�ected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants �led a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 25 June 2018, the plainti�s �led an opposition to the motion to dismiss and, on 25 July 2018, a further reply in support of the motion to dismiss was �led by the Company. In August 2018, oral argument on the motion to dismiss was heard by the Court.

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the Court dismissed the plainti�s claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions.

On 15 May 2020, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., and certain of the Company's current or former directors and o�cers, have entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the "Stipulation") with lead plainti� the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi in the putative securities class action �led against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. As consideration for the settlement of the class action, the Company has agreed to pay US$ 9 million.

The settlement is subject to the approval of the court and may be terminated prior to court approval pursuant to the grounds for termination set forth in the Stipulation. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the settlement consideration, lead plainti� and members of the settlement class who do not opt-out of this settlement would release, among other things, the claims that were asserted, or that they could have asserted, in this class action. In entering into the settlement, the defendants do not admit, and explicitly deny, any liability or wrongdoing of any kind.

Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, the settlement resolves the remainder of the litigation.

As the Company is adequately insured with respect to the aforesaid liability, the settlement did not have any impact on the Company's statement of pro�t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

The amount payable to the plainti�s on account of the settlement and the corresponding receivable from the insurer have been presented under "other current �nancial assets� and �other current �nancial liabilities", respectively, in the balance sheet of the Company 31 March 2020.

On 23 December 2020, the court issued a �nal order and judgment approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement/court order, the escrow was funded on 4 January 2021. The e�ective date of the settlement occurred on 1 February 2021, upon transfer of the settlement fund balance into the �nal escrow account. As the transfer of funds to the �nal escrow account constitutes settlement of liability, the amount of liability has been derecognised during the three months ended 31 March 2021.

## (iv) Internal Investigation

The Company has commenced a detailed investigation into an anonymous complaint. The complaint alleges that healthcare professionals in Ukraine and potentially in other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the Company in violation of U.S. anti-corruption laws, speci�cally the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. A US law �rm is conducting the investigation at the instruction of a committee of the Company's Board of Directors. The investigation is ongoing. The Company has disclosed the matter to the US Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and Securities Exchange Board of India. While the matter may result in government enforcement actions against the Company in the United States and/or foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws, the probability of such action and the outcome are not reasonably ascertainable at this time.

## (v) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action �led a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollaram and Jeedimetla areas for discharging e�uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was �xed at 0.0013 per acre for dry land and 0.0017 per acre for wet land. ₹ ₹ Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ ₹ 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently �led a review petition against the judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company �led an appeal challenging this judgement.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgement in July 2018 and directed the respondents to �le their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents �led counter a�davits and the matter has now been adjourned for �nal hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgement of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued G.O.Ms. No 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded �scal year i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019. ₹

During the three months ended 30 September 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") has issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated 24 October 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the �scal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of the said e�ected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram.

The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application �led by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the �scal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5 % as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated 3 August 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G O Ms No 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G O Ms No 31 dated 24 May 2019 and basis the judgement of NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017 for the �scal years 2015-2016 to 2018 -2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2 and CTO-3 of the Company.

On 22 November 2019, The Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued an Interim Order which stayed the demand on the condition that the Company deposit 60 as the remediation fee for the �scal year 2018-2019 payable in the �scal year 2019-2020. The deposit of 60 was ₹ ₹ made and the Interim Order is continuing. The matter was adjourned to 22 April 2020, but has been delayed as a result of the closure of the Court due to the COVID-19 lockdown, and a new date has not yet been rescheduled.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the �nancial statements.

## 2.29 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities speci�ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-�nding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners that was pending in the National Green Tribunal, (the "NGT"), Delhi.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a noti�cation in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the NGT. Importantly, the noti�cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to the point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a noti�cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This noti�cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's noti�cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

The appeals �led by Mr. �. Chidambaram against the Orders of the Appellate Authority, Andhra Pradesh are disposed o� as the same do not survive for consideration as the G.O. based on which the then APPCB had passed its order which was subject matter of appeal before the Appellate Authority has itself been amended vide order 25 July 2013. However, the NGT, Delhi has passed a direction for the issue of pollution to be considered by the Joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Institute (NEERI), and the Telangana State Pollution Control Board to ascertain the present status of pollution issues in the Medak, Ranga Reddy, Mahaboobnagar and Nalagonda districts in the State of Telangana particularly in the Patancheru and Bollaram industrial clusters and �le a report within three months before the NGT, Delhi.

## (vi) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions �led by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company ₹ has recorded 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of 354 as ₹ ₹ demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional �nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition �led by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an 31 March 2013.

The business consists of a portfolio of 62 brands in multiple therapy areas such as respiratory, neurology, venous malformations, dermatology, gastroenterology, pain and vaccines. This entire portfolio was to be transferred to the Company, along with related sales and marketing teams, the manufacturing plant located in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh and all plant employees (together the "Business Undertaking"). The transaction involved 2,051 employees engaged in operations of the acquired Business Undertaking.

As of 31 March 2020, the acquisition of this Business Undertaking was subject to certain closing conditions, such as approval from shareholders and lenders of Wockhardt and other requisite approvals under applicable statutes. Hence, the transaction was not accounted for in the year ended 31 March 2020.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent government restrictions, there has been a reduction in the revenue from the sales of the products forming part of the Business Undertaking during March and April 2020. Accordingly, through an amendment to the BTA, the Company and Wockhardt agreed that the consideration shall now be upto 18,500, to be paid as per the following terms: ₹

- a) an amount of  ₹ 14,830 to be paid on the date of closing;
- b) an amount of 670 to be deposited in an escrow account which shall be released subject to adjustments for, inter alia, net working capital, ₹ employee liabilities and certain other contractual and statutory liabilities;
- c) an amount of 3,000 (the "Holdback Amount") which shall be released as follows: ₹
- Ÿ If the revenue from sales of the products forming part of the Business Undertaking during the twelve (12) months post-closing exceeds ₹ 4,800, the Company will be required to pay to Wockhardt an amount equal to two (2) times the amount by which the revenue exceeds 4,800, subject to the maximum of the Holdback Amount. ₹

The acquisition is in line with the Company's strategic focus on India and has paved a path for accelerated growth and leadership in the domestic Indian market. The Company believes that the acquired Business Undertaking o�ers to strengthen the Company's pharmaceutical portfolio and products in the Indian market.

The transaction was completed on 10 June 2020.

The Company has accounted for the transaction under Ind AS 103, "Business Combinations".

As of 30 June 2020, the purchase price allocation was preliminary.

a multiple of incremental revenue targets subject to a maximum amount. The accounting for the business combination was complex due to the signi�cant estimation required by management to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and the contingent consideration. The signi�cant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to the underlying assumptions utilized in the measurement of the fair value of the intangible assets and contingent consideration. The Company used a discounted cash �ow model to measure the fair value of the intangible assets, which included signi�cant assumptions such as the discount rate, useful life, and long-term growth rate. The Company measured the contingent consideration at its estimated fair value, and the signi�cant assumptions used to determine the fair value of contingent consideration included forecasted revenue projections, revenue volatility and a risk adjusted discount rate. Considering the above, this has been included as a Key Audit Matter.

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Assessment of carrying value of intangible assets, intangible assets under development and goodwill (as described in note 1.3(g) and 1.3(j) of the signi�cant accounting policies� and note �.�� �.3 and �.� for details and movement in good�ill� other intangible assets and intangible assets under development respectively in the consolidated �nancial statements)

As at 31 March 2021, the Company has intangible assets, including intangible assets under development, of ' 35,248 million and goodwill of ' 5,599 million. The carrying value of these intangible assets are based on future cash flows and there is a risk that the assets may be impaired if cash flows are not in line with projections.

## Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We evaluated the design and tested the operating e�ectiveness of the Company's controls in assessing the recoverable value of goodwill, intangible assets and intangible assets under development.
- · We assessed the Group's methodology applied in determining the CGUs to which these assets are allocated.
- · We tested the estimated recoverable value of these assets and assessed the methodologies used by management in deriving the recoverable value and tested the signi�cant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses.
- · We compared the signi�cant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, to the Company's historical data.
- · We performed sensitivity analyses of the signi�cant assumptions to evaluate the potential change in the recoverable values of these assets resulting from hypothetical changes in underlying assumptions. We also assessed the recoverable value headroom by performing sensitivity testing of key assumptions used.

Valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to management's assessment of recoverable amount, being the higher of the value in use and fair value less costs to sell, involving signi�cant judgment and are based on number of variables and estimates including projection of future sales, operating costs and pro�t margins; appropriate discount rate and terminal value growth rate; and probability of technical and regulatory success factors in applying discounted cash �ow valuation methodology. As the assessment of recoverable amount involves signi�cant degree of management judgement, we have identi�ed this a key audit matter.

Contingencies, including litigations and tax (as described in note 1.3(l) of the signi�cant accounting policies� and note �.3� (�) containing details of contingencies in the consolidated �nancial statements)

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, anti-trust, governmental and / or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent, tax and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Most of the claims involve complex issues. The Company assisted by their external legal counsel assesses the need to make provision or disclose a contingency on a case-to-case basis considering the underlying facts of each litigation.

This area is significant to our audit, since the accounting and disclosure for contingent legal and tax liabilities is complex and judgmental (due to the di�culty in predicting the outcome of the matter and estimating the potential impact if the outcome is unfavourable), and the amounts involved are, or can be, material to the consolidated financial statements.

## Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We evaluated the design and tested the operating e�ectiveness of controls relating to identification and evaluation of claims, proceedings and investigations at di�erent levels in the group, and the measurement of provisions for disputes, potential claims and litigation, contingent liabilities and disclosures.
- · We obtained a list of ongoing litigations from the Company's in-house legal counsel. We selected a sample of litigations based on materiality and performed inquiries with the said counsel on the legal evaluation of these litigations. We compared the evaluation with the provision or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements. We tested the underlying computation of the management in relation to the measurement of provision or the contingency.
- · We obtained legal letters from the Company's external legal advisors with respect to the matters included in the summary. Where appropriate, we examined correspondences connected with the cases.
- · We inspected relevant communication with tax authorities.
- · We involved tax experts in assessing the nature and amount of material indirect tax positions and assessed the technical merits based on the correspondence and assessments from the relevant tax authorities.
- · We also evaluated the disclosures made in the consolidated �nancial statements.

## Key audit matters

## How our audit addressed the key audit matter

Rebates, discounts, chargebacks, and other deductions in revenue (as described in note 1.3(m) of the si�ni�cant acco�ntin� �olicies of consolidated �nancial statements and note �.13 of the consolidated �nancial statements)

Revenue is recognised net of accrual for chargeback, rebates, sales returns and discounts, etc. The estimates relating to the accruals are important given the significance of revenue and also considering the distinctive terms of arrangement with customers. These estimates are complex and requires significant judgement and estimation by the Company for establishing an appropriate accrual. Accuracy of revenues may deviate on account of change in judgements and estimates. Accordingly, the same has been considered as a key audit matter.

## Our audit procedures, among others included the following:

- · We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating e�ectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes.
- · We also tested management's controls over the accuracy and completeness of the estimates used to calculate the sales deductions.
- · We tested management's estimated sales deductions and obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates. We tested management's estimates over the determination of sales deductions accruals by comparing the rates used in management's estimate to rates in the underlying contracts and historical sales deductions data.
- · We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and returns, as applicable to current payment trends.
- · We also considered the historical accuracy of the management's estimates in prior years and assessed the estimated amounts, we evaluated trends in actual sales and discount accrual balances.
- · We also tested the underlying data used in management's calculations for accuracy and completeness and veri�ed source data supporting the inventory levels, rebate claims paid subsequent to period end, and volume discounts settled during the period.
- · We tested recording of revenue in appropriate period which included the following procedures:
- · Performed trend analysis over sales levels as compared to previous periods;
- · Tested management's monitoring process over distributors' stocking levels;
- · Veri�ed sample sales transactions near period-end

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

## Responsibilities of Management for the Consolidated Financial Statements

The Holding Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and presentation of these consolidated �nancial statements in terms of the requirements of the Act that give a true and fair view of the consolidated �nancial position, consolidated �nancial performance including other comprehensive income, consolidated cash �ows and consolidated statement of changes in equity of the Group and joint ventures in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) speci�ed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Group and of its joint ventures and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal �nancial controls, that were operating e�ectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the consolidated �nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated �nancial statements by the Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT (CONTINUED)

## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated �nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in�uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated �nancial statements.

As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- · Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated �nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su�cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- · Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Holding Company has adequate internal �nancial controls with reference to �nancial statements in place and the operating e�ectiveness of such controls.
- · Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- · Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi�cant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint ventures to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated �nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint ventures to cease to continue as a going concern.
- · Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated �nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated �nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- · Obtain su�cient appropriate audit evidence regarding the �nancial information of the entities or business activities within the Group of which we are the independent auditors and whose �nancial information we have audited, to express an opinion on the consolidated �nancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the �nancial statements of such entities included in the consolidated �nancial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated �nancial statements, which have been audited by other auditors, such other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance of the Holding Company and such other entities included in the consolidated �nancial statements of which we are the independent auditors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi�cant audit �ndings, including any signi�cant de�ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi�cance in the audit of the consolidated �nancial statements for the �nancial year ended 31 March ���1 and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene�ts of such communication.

## ANNEXURE 1 TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT OF EVEN DATE ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF DR. REDDY'S LABORATORIES LIMITED

## Report on the Internal Financial Controls under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 ("the Act")

In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated �nancial statements of Dr. Reddy's �aboratories �imited (hereinafter referred to as the "Holding Company") as of and for the year ended 31 March 2021, we have audited the internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements of the Holding Company and its subsidiaries (the Holding Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as "the Group") and its joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, as of that date.

## Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls

The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint ventures, which are companies incorporated in India, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal �nancial controls based on the internal control over �nancial reporting criteria established by the Holding Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India ("ICAI"). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal �nancial controls that were operating e�ectively for ensuring the orderly and e�cient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable �nancial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.

## Auditor's Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Holding Company's internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the "Guidance Note") and the Standards on Auditing, speci�ed under section 1�3(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal �nancial controls, both, issued by ICAI. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements was established and maintained and if such controls operated e�ectively in all material respects.

Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements and their operating e�ectiveness. Our audit of internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e�ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the �nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters paragraph below, is su�cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements.

## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

A company's internal �nancial control with reference to consolidated �nancial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of �nancial reporting and the preparation of �nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal �nancial control with reference to consolidated �nancial statements includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re�ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of �nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e�ect on the �nancial statements.

## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls With Reference to Consolidated Financial Statements

Because of the inherent limitations of internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal �nancial controls with reference to consolidated �nancial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## 1.2 BASIS OF PREPARATION OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## a) Statement of compliance

These consolidated �nancial statements as of and for the year ended 31 March 2021 comply in all material aspects with the Indian Accounting Standards ("Ind AS") noti�ed under the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 201�, and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013, and as amended from time to time together with the comparative period data as at and for the year ended 31 March 2020.

These consolidated �nancial statements have been prepared by the Company as a going concern on the basis of relevant Ind AS that are e�ective or elected for early adoption at the Company's annual reporting date, 31�March 2021 These consolidated �nancial statements were authorised for issuance by the Company's Board of Directors on 14 May 2021.

## b) Basis of measurement

These consolidated �nancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis, except for the following material items in the balance sheet:

- · derivative �nancial instruments are measured at fair value;
- · �nancial assets are measured either at fair value or at amortised cost, depending on the classi�cation;
- · employee de�ned bene�t assets/(liabilities) are recognised as the net total of the fair value of plan assets, adjusted for actuarial gains/(losses) and the present value of the de�ned bene�t obligation;
- · long-term borrowings are measured at amortised cost using the e�ective interest rate method;
- · share-based payments are measured at fair value;
- · investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method;
- · assets held for sale are measured at fair value;
- · assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of business combinations are measured at fair value; and
- · right-of-use the assets are recognised at the present value of lease payments that are not paid at that date. This amount is adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, lease incentives received and initial direct costs, incurred, if any.

## c) Functional and presentation currency

These consolidated �nancial statements are presented in Indian rupees, which is the functional currency of the parent company. All �nancial information presented in Indian rupees has been rounded to the nearest million.

In respect of certain non-Indian subsidiaries that operate as marketing arms of the parent company in their respective countries/ regions, the functional currency has been determined to be the functional currency of the parent company (i.e., the Indian rupee). The operations of these entities are largely restricted to importing of �nished goods from the parent company in India, sales of these products in the foreign country and making of import payments to the parent company. The cash �ows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The cash �ows realised from sales of goods are available for making import payments to the parent company and cash is paid to the parent company on a regular basis. The costs incurred by these entities are primarily the cost of goods imported from the parent company. The �nancing of these subsidiaries is done directly or indirectly by the parent company.

In respect of subsidiaries whose operations are self-contained and integrated within their respective countries/regions, the functional currency has been generally determined to be the local currency of those countries/regions, unless use of a di�erent currency is considered appropriate.

## d) Use of estimates and judgements

The preparation of �nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that a�ect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may di�er from these estimates.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods a�ected. In particular, information about signi�cant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most signi�cant e�ect on the amounts recognised in the �nancial statements is included in the following notes�

- · Note 1.2(c) - Assessment of functional currency;
- · Note 1.3(b) - Evaluation of joint arrangements;
- · Note 1.3(d) - Financial instruments;
- · Note 1.3(e) - Business combinations;
- · Notes 1.3(f) and 1.3(g) - Useful lives of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets;
- · Notes 1.3(h) - Determination of cost for right-of-use assets and lease term;
- · Note 1.3(i) - Valuation of inventories;
- · Note 1.3(j) - Measurement of recoverable amounts of cash-generating units;
- · Note 1.3(k) - Assets and obligations relating to employee bene�ts;
- · Note 1.3(k) - Share-based payments;
- · Note 1.3(l) - Provisions and other accruals;
- · Note 1.3(m) - Measurement of transaction price in a revenue transaction (sales returns, rebates and chargeback provisions);
- · Note 1.3(p) - Evaluation of recoverability of deferred tax assets, and estimation of income tax payable and income tax expense in relation to uncertain tax positions; and
- · Note 1.3(l) - Contingencies

## e) Current and non-current c�assi�cation

All assets and liabilities have been classi�ed as current or non-current as per the Company's normal operating cycle and other criteria set out in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 and Ind AS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.

## Assets :

An asset is classi�ed as current when it satis�es any of the following criteria�

- a) it is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) it is cash or a cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.

## Liabilities :

A liability is classi�ed as current when it satis�es any of the following criteria�

- a) it is expected to be settled in the Company's normal operating cycle;
- b) it is held primarily for the purpose of being traded;
- c) it is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
- d) the Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not a�ect its classi�cation.

Current assets and liabilities include the current portion of non-current assets and liabilities respectively. All other assets and liabilities are classi�ed as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classi�ed as non-current.

## f) Prior period

Prior period amounts have been reclassi�ed to conform to the current year classi�cation.

## 1.3 SIGNIFICANTACCOUNTINGPOLICIES

## a) New Standards adopted by the Company

On 24 July 2020, the Ministry of Corporate A�airs (MCA) has issued amendments to certain Ind AS as summarised below�

## Amendments to Ind AS 1 and Ind AS 8: Denition of Material

The amendments provided a new de�nition to the word material as follows�

'Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to in�uence decisions that the primary users of general-purpose �nancial statements make on the basis of those �nancial statements, which provide �nancial information about a speci�c reporting entity.'

The amendments clarify that materiality will depend on the nature or magnitude of information, either individually or in combination with other information, in the context of the �nancial statements. A misstatement of information is material if it could reasonably be expected to in�uence decisions made by the primary users.

An information is considered to be obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar e�ect for primary users of �nancial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The amendments provided examples of circumstances that may result in information being obscured.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

An entity should apply the amendments prospectively for annual periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020.

The amendments to the de�nition of material had no impact on the consolidated �nancial statements of the Company.

Amendments to Ind AS 103: Denition of a Business

The amendments introduced a revised de�nition of a business for the purpose of identifying a business combination under Ind AS 103 "Business Combinations" . As per the revised de�nition, business is 'an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or generating other income from ordinary activities'.

A related amendment has been made to the de�nition of 'output' as an element of business.

The amendments include an election to use a 'concentration test'. This is a simpli�ed assessment that would cause an acquisition to qualify as an asset acquisition. The concentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identi�able asset or a group of similar identi�able assets.

An entity is required to apply the amendments to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the �rst annual reporting period beginning on or after the 1 April 2020 and to asset acquisitions that occur on or after the beginning of that period.

This amendment had no impact on the consolidated �nancial statements of the Company but may impact future periods should the Company enter into any business combinations.

Ind AS 109 and Ind AS 107: Interest Rate Benchmark Reform

The amendments to Ind AS 109 "Financial Instruments" provide a number of reliefs, which apply to all hedging relationships that are directly a�ected by interest rate benchmark reform. A hedging relationship is a�ected if the reform gives rise to uncertainty about the timing and/or amount of benchmark-based cash �ows of the hedged item or the hedging instrument.

The amendments to Ind AS 107 "Financial Instruments: Disclosures" prescribe the disclosures which entities are required to make for hedging relationships to which the reliefs as per the amendments in Ind AS 109 are applied.

These amendments are applicable for annual periods beginning on or after the 1 April 2020.

These amendments had no impact on the consolidated �nancial statements of the Company as it does not have any interest rate hedge relationships.

Amendments Ind AS 116: COVID-19 related rent concessions

Ind AS 116 has been amended to provide limited relief to lessees in respect of rent concessions arising due to COVID-19 pandemic. No relief has been allowed to the lessors.

The amendments provide a practical expedient that lessees may elect to not treat any rent concessions, provided by lessors as a direct consequence of COVID-19 pandemic, as lease modi�cations. �owever, to be eligible for this relief:

- · the revised consideration for the lease should be less than or equal to the lease consideration immediately before the change;
- · the rent concession should be for a period that does not extend beyond 30 June 2021 (for example, lease rents are reduced for a period upto 30 June 2021 and increased for periods thereafter); and
- · there should be no substantial modi�cation to the other terms and conditions of the lease.

Lessee should apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2020. In case a lessee has not yet approved the �nancial statements for issue before the issuance of the amendments, then the same may be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after the 1 April 2019.

The aforesaid amendments had no impact on the consolidated �nancial statements of the Company.

## For the year ended 31 March 2020

## Ind AS 116, "Leases"

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate A�airs (MCA) noti�ed Ind AS 116, Leases as part of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS)) Amendment Rules, 2019. Ind AS 116 replaces existing standard on leases i.e. Ind AS 17, Leases with e�ect from accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2019.

The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating the distinction between operating and �nance leases. Lessor accounting, however, remains largely unchanged and the distinction between operating and �nance leases is retained.

Impact of the implementation of Ind AS 116 on the Company:

The Company adopted Ind AS 116 e�ective as of 1 April 2019. Ind AS 116, �Leases� changed the �nancial statements of the Company as the majority of leases for which the Company is the lessee became on-balance sheet liabilities with corresponding right-of-use assets also recognised on the consolidated balance sheet. The lease liability re�ects the net present value of the remaining lease payments adjusted for payments made before the commencement date, lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement, and the right-of-use asset corresponds to the lease liability.

Upon adoption of the new standard, a portion of the annual operating lease costs, which was previously fully recognised as a rental/ lease expense, is recorded as interest expense. In addition, the portion of the lease payments which represents the reduction of the lease liability is recognised in the statement of cash �ows as an out�ow from �nancing activities, which was previously fully recognised as an out�ow from operating activities.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

The Company implemented the new standard on 1 April 2019, and applied the modi�ed retrospective method, with right-of-use assets measured at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of the prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to those leases recognised in the consolidated balance sheet immediately before the date of initial application and will not restate prior years.

The Company elected to use the transition practical expedient that allows the standard to be applied only to contracts previously identi�ed under Ind AS 1�, "Leases" and the contracts assessed using the guidance available under Appendix C to Ind AS 1�, "Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease".

The Company also elected to use the recognition exemption for lease contracts that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not contain a purchase option ("short-term leases") and lease contracts for which the underlying asset is of low value ("low value assets").

On 1 April 2019, the Company recognised lease liabilities of ' 1,335 (presented as part of borrowings) and right-of-use assets of ' 1,153, after adjustments of ' 182 towards lease incentives and other items related to the lease agreement as at 31 March 2019 (presented as part of Property, plant and equipment).

Consequently, the Company has recognised an amount of ' 491 in depreciation expense and ' 230 in �nance costs for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Adoption of the new standard had no impact upon leases for which the Company is a lessor.

Appendix C to Ind AS 12, "Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments"

On 30 March 2019, the Ministry of Corporate A�airs (MCA) made certain amendments to Ind AS 12, Income taxes by including Appendix C, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments. This appendix clari�es how the recognition and measurement requirements of Ind AS 12 are applied where there is uncertainty over income tax treatments. It does not apply to taxes or levies outside the scope of Ind AS 12, nor does it speci�cally include requirements relating to interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax treatments.

Appendix C explains how to recognise and measure deferred and current income tax assets and liabilities where there is uncertainty over a tax treatment. An uncertain tax treatment is any tax treatment applied by an entity where there is uncertainty over whether that treatment will be accepted by the applicable tax authority. For example, a decision to claim a deduction for a speci�c expense or not to include a speci�c item of income in a tax return is an uncertain tax treatment if its acceptability is uncertain under applicable tax law. The interpretation provides speci�c guidance in several areas where previously Ind AS 12 was silent. Appendix C applies to all aspects of income tax accounting where there is an uncertainty regarding the treatment of an item, including taxable pro�t or loss, the tax bases of assets and liabilities, tax losses and credits and tax rates.

The Company applied the interpretation e�ective 1 April 2019 using the modi�ed retrospective approach. The adoption of Appendix C did not have any material impact on the �nancial statements of the Company.

## b) Basis of consolidation

Subsidiaries

Subsidiaries are all entities (including special purpose entities) that are controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a�ect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive. The �nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated �nancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.

Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and balance sheet respectively.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated �nancial statements, the accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company.

Joint arrangements (equity accounted investees)

Joint arrangements are those arrangements over which the parties have joint control, established by contractual agreement and requiring unanimous consent for strategic �nancial and operating decisions.

A joint arrangement is either a joint operation or a joint venture. A joint operation is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement. A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.

With respect to joint operations, the Company recognises its direct right to the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of joint operations and its share of any jointly held or incurred assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.

Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method and are initially recognised at cost. The carrying value of the Company's investment includes goodwill identi�ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment losses. The Company does not consolidate entities where the non-controlling interest ("NCI") holders have certain signi�cant participating rights that provide for e�ective involvement in signi�cant decisions in the ordinary course of business of such entities. Investments in such entities are accounted by the equity method of accounting. When the Company's share of losses exceeds its interest in an equity accounted investee, the carrying amount of that interest (including any long-term investments) is reduced to zero and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that the Company has an obligation or has made payments on behalf of the investee.

For the purpose of preparing these consolidated �nancial statements, the accounting policies of joint ventures have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Company. Furthermore, the �nancial statements of the joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as of the Company.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

## Transactions eliminated on consolidation

Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in full while preparing these consolidated �nancial statements. Unrealised gains or losses arising from transactions with equity accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Company's interest in the investee.

## Changes in ownership interests

Acquisition of some or all of the NCI is accounted for as a transaction with equity holders in their capacity as equity holders. Consequently, the di�erence arising between the fair value of the purchase consideration paid and the carrying value of the NCI is recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings that is attributable to the parent company. The associated cash �ows are classi�ed as �nancing activities. No goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions.

## Loss of Control

Upon loss of control, the Company derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any NCIs and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or de�cit arising on the loss of control is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. If the Company retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost. Subsequently, depending on the level of in�uence retained, it is accounted for as an equity-accounted investee or as an investment measured at fair value through other comprehensive income ("FVTOCI") or fair value through pro�t or loss ("FVT�L"), under Ind AS 109.

## c) Foreign currency

## Foreign currency transactions

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of entities within the Company at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date. Non-monetary items that are measured based on historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.

Exchange di�erences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates di�erent from those at which they were translated on initial recognition during the period or in previous �nancial statements are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss in the period in which they arise.

However, foreign currency di�erences arising from the translation of the following items are recognised in other comprehensive income ("OCI"):

- · certain debt instruments classi�ed as measured at FVTOCI;
- · certain equity instruments where the Company had made an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value;
- · a �nancial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation, to the extent that the hedge is e�ective; and
- · qualifying cash �ow hedges, to the extent that the hedges are e�ective.

When several exchange rates are available, the rate used is that at which the future cash �ows represented by the transaction or balance could have been settled if those cash �ows had occurred at the measurement date.

## Foreign operations

Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from a monetary item receivable from a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are considered to form part of the net investment in the foreign operation and are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as foreign currency translation reserve ("FCTR").

In case of foreign operations whose functional currency is di�erent from the parent company's functional currency, the assets and liabilities of such foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising upon acquisition, are translated to the reporting currency at exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of such foreign operations are translated to the reporting currency at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the year. Resulting foreign currency di�erences are recognised in OCI and presented within equity as part of FCTR. When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, such that control, signi�cant in�uence or joint control is lost, the relevant amount in the FCTR is reclassi�ed to the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## d) Financial instruments

A �nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a �nancial asset of one entity and a �nancial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

## Financial assets

Initial recognition and measurement

All �nancial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of �nancial assets not recorded at fair value through pro�t or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the �nancial asset. �urchases or sales of �nancial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (e.g., regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.

Trade receivables are recognised initially at the amount of consideration that is unconditional unless they contain signi�cant �nancing components, in which case they are recognised at fair value. The Company's trade receivables do not contain any signi�cant �nancing component and hence are measured at the transaction price measured under Ind AS 115 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" .

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

Subsequent measurement

For purposes of subsequent measurement, �nancial assets are classi�ed in four categories:

- · Debt instruments at amortised cost;
- · Debt instruments at FVTOCI;
- · Debt instruments, derivatives and equity instruments at FVTPL; and
- · Equity instruments measured at FVTOCI.

Debt instruments at amortised cost

A "debt instrument" is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

- a) the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash �ows; and
- b) contractual terms of the asset give rise on speci�ed dates to cash �ows that are solely payments of principal and interest ("SPPI") on the principal amount outstanding.

After initial measurement, such �nancial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e�ective interest rate method and are subject to impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the e�ective interest rate.

Interest income from these �nancial assets is included in �nance income using the e�ective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in pro�t and loss and presented in other gains�(losses). The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

## Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A "debt instrument" is classi�ed as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

- a) the objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash �ows and selling the �nancial assets; and
- b) the asset's contractual cash �ows represent SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognised in the OCI. However, the Company recognises interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassi�ed to the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. Interest earned while holding a FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the e�ective interest rate method.

## Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classi�ed as at FVTPL.

In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortised cost or FVTOCI criteria, as FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as an "accounting mismatch").

Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## Equity investments

All equity investments within the scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. Equity instruments which are held for trading and contingent consideration recognised by an acquirer in a business combination to which Ind AS 103 applies, are classi�ed as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classi�cation is made upon initial recognition and is irrevocable.

If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognised in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity investments designated as FVTOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.

Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## Derecognition

A �nancial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a �nancial asset or part of a group of similar �nancial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company's consolidated balance sheet) when:

- · the rights to receive cash �ows from the asset have expired; or
- · both (1) the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash �ows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash �ows in full without material delay to a third party under a "pass-through" arrangement; and (�) either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash �ows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company's continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that re�ects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.

## Impairment of trade receivables and other �nancial assets

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another �nancial asset.

For this purpose, the Company follows a "simpli�ed approach� for recognition of impairment loss allowance on the trade receivable balances. The application of this simpli�ed approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial recognition.

As a practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its trade receivables. The provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

## Financial liabilities

Initial recognition and measurement

Financial liabilities are classi�ed, at initial recognition, as �nancial liabilities at FVTPL, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an e�ective hedge, as appropriate.

All �nancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.

The Company's �nancial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts and derivative �nancial instruments.

## Subsequent measurement

The measurement of �nancial liabilities depends on their classi�cation, as described below:

## Financial liabilities at FVTPL

Financial liabilities at FVTPL include �nancial liabilities held for trading and �nancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classi�ed as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative �nancial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as de�ned by Ind AS 109. Separated embedded derivatives are also classi�ed as held for trading unless they are designated as e�ective hedging instruments.

Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at FVTPL are designated as such at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satis�ed. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains� losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains or losses are not subsequently transferred to the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. The Company has not designated any �nancial liability as FVTPL.

## Loans and borrowings

Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any di�erence between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption amount is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss over the period of the borrowings using the e�ective interest method.

After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e�ective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the e�ective interest rate amortisation process.

Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the e�ective interest rate. The e�ective interest rate amortisation is included as �nance costs in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## Derecognition

A �nancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing �nancial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially di�erent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modi�ed, such an exchange or modi�cation is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The di�erence in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## Derivative �nancial instruments

The Company is exposed to exchange rate risk which arises from its foreign exchange revenues and expenses, primarily in US dollars, UK pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus, Australian dollars and Euros, and foreign currency debt in US dollars, Russian roubles, South African rands, Mexican pesos, Ukrainian hryvnias and Brazilian reals.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

The Company uses derivative �nancial instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts to mitigate its risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company also uses non-derivative �nancial instruments as part of its foreign currency exposure risk mitigation strategy. Derivatives are classi�ed as �nancial assets when the fair value is positive and as �nancial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

## Hedges of highly probable forecasted transactions

The Company classi�es its derivative �nancial instruments that hedge foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions as cash �ow hedges and measures them at fair value. The e�ective portion of such cash �ow hedges is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and re-classi�ed to the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions. The ine�ective portion of such cash �ow hedges is recorded in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as �nance costs immediately.

The Company also designates certain non-derivative �nancial liabilities, such as foreign currency borrowings from banks, as hedging instruments for hedge of foreign currency risk associated with highly probable forecasted transactions. Accordingly, the Company applies cash �ow hedge accounting to such relationships. Remeasurement gain or loss on such non-derivative �nancial liabilities is recorded in the Company's hedging reserve as a component of equity and reclassi�ed to the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as part of the hedged item in the period corresponding to the occurrence of the forecasted transactions.

If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, then hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively. The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI, remains there until the forecasted transaction occurs. If the forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, then the balance in OCI is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## Hedges of recognised assets and liabilities

Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. The changes in fair value of such derivative contracts, as well as the foreign exchange gains and losses relating to the monetary items, are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

## Cash and cash equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insigni�cant risk of changes in value. �or this purpose, �short-term� means investments having original maturities of three months or less from the date of investment. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand form an integral part of the Company's cash management and are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash �ows.

## e) Business combinations

The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. Judgement is applied in determining the acquisition date and determining whether control is transferred from one party to another. Control exists when the Company is exposed to, or has rights to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a�ect those returns through power over the entity. In assessing control, potential voting rights are considered only if the rights are substantive.

The Company determines that it has acquired a business when the acquired set of activities and assets include an input and a substantive process that together signi�cantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. The acquired process is considered substantive if it is critical to the ability to continue producing outputs, and the inputs acquired include an organised workforce with the necessary skills, knowledge, or experience to perform that process or it signi�cantly contributes to the ability to continue producing outputs and is considered unique or scarce or cannot be replaced without signi�cant cost, e�ort, or delay in the ability to continue producing outputs.

The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is comprised of:

- · fair values of the assets transferred;
- · liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business;
- · equity interests issued by the Company;
- · fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement; and
- · fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary.

Identi�able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Company recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquired entity's net identi�able assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

The excess of the sum of:

- · the consideration transferred;
- · the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity; and
- · the acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity.

over the fair value of the net identi�able assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identi�able assets of the business acquired, the di�erence is recognised directly in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as a bargain purchase.

Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent �nancier under comparable terms and conditions.

Contingent consideration is classi�ed either as equity or a �nancial liability. Contingent consideration classi�ed as equity is not re-measured and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Amounts classi�ed as a �nancial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value, with changes in fair value recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in the acquiree is re-measured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such re-measurement are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## f) Property, plant and equipment

Recognition and measurement

Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Cost includes expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use. Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have di�erent useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.

Gains and losses upon disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised net within "Other income/ Selling and other expense, net" in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic bene�ts embodied within the part will �ow to the Company and its cost can be measured reliably. The costs of repairs and maintenance are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as incurred.

Items of property, plant and equipment acquired through exchange of non-monetary assets are measured at fair value, unless the exchange transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of either the asset received or asset given up is not reliably measurable, in which case the asset exchanged is recorded at the carrying amount of the asset given up.

## Depreciation

Depreciation is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated but subject to impairment.

Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and any changes are considered prospectively.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| PARTICULARS                            | YEARS    |
|----------------------------------------|----------|
| Buildings                              |          |
| - Factory and administrative buildings | 20 to 50 |
| - Ancillary structures                 | 3 to 15  |
| Plant and equipment                    | 3 to 15  |
| Furniture, �xtures and o�ce equipment  | 3 to 10  |
| Vehicles                               | 4 to 5   |

Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013 ("Schedule") prescribes the useful lives for various classes of tangible assets. For certain class of assets, based on the technical evaluation and assessment, the Company believes that the useful lives adopted by it best represent the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use. Accordingly, for these assets, the useful lives estimated by the Company are di�erent from those prescribed in the Schedule.

Software for internal use, which is primarily acquired from third-party vendors and which is an integral part of a tangible asset, including consultancy charges for implementing the software, is capitalised as part of the related tangible asset. Subsequent costs associated with maintaining such software are recognised as expense as incurred. The capitalised costs are amortised over the estimated useful life of the software or the remaining useful life of the tangible �xed asset, whichever is lower.

Advances paid towards the acquisition of property, plant and equipment outstanding at each reporting date and the cost of property, plant and equipment not ready to use before such date are disclosed under other non-current assets. Assets not ready for use are not depreciated but are tested for impairment.

| Goodwill                                                                                        | Goodwill represents the excess of consideration transferred, together with the amount of non-controlling  interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of the Company's share of identi�able net assets acquired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

In respect of equity accounted investees,  the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment, and any impairment  loss on such an investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill, that forms part of the carrying  value of the equity accounted investee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

The cost of intangible assets  acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Expenditures on research activities undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scienti�c or technical  knowledge and understanding are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss when incurred.                                                                                                       |

Development expenditures are capitalised only if:  · development costs can be measured reliably;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The Company's criteria for capitalisation  of such assets are consistent with the guidance given in paragraph 25 of Indian Accounting Standard  ("Ind AS 38") (i.e., the receipt of economic bene�ts embodied in each intangible asset separately purchased  or licensed in the transaction is considered to be probable). Acquired research and development intangible assets that are under development are recognised as                     |
| In-Process Research  and Development  assets ("IPR&D")  or Intangible assets  under development | In-Process Research and Development assets ("IPR&D") or intangible assets under development. Intangible  assets under development are not amortised, but evaluated for potential impairment on an annual basis or  when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any impairment charge on such  intangible assets under development assets is recorded in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss  under "Impairment of non-current assets".                                                                                                                                             |

| In-Process Research  and Development  assets ("IPR&D")  or Intangible assets  under development | Subsequent expenditure on an IPR&D or intangible assets under development project acquired separately or  in a business combination and recognised as an intangible asset is: · recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is a research expenditure;  · recognised as an expense when incurred, if it is a development expenditure that does not satisfy the  criteria for recognition as an intangible asset in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38; and · added to the carrying amount of the acquired IPR&D project, if it is a development expenditure that  satis�es the recognition criteria in paragraph 57 of Ind AS 38. |

## Amortisation

Amortisation is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets. The amortization expense is recognised in the statement of pro�t and loss account in the expense category that is consistent with the function of the intangible asset. Intangible assets that are not available for use are amortised from the date they are available for use.

The estimated useful lives are as follows:

| PARTICULARS                 | YEARS   |
|-----------------------------|---------|
| Product related intangibles | 3 to 20 |
| Other intangibles           | 3 to 15 |

Company Overview Statutory Reports

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

The amortisation period and the amortisation method for intangible assets with a �nite useful life are reviewed at each reporting date.

Goodwill, intangible assets relating to products in development, other intangible assets not available for use and intangible assets having inde�nite useful life are subject to impairment testing at each reporting date. All other intangible assets are tested for impairment when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable. All impairment losses are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss under �Impairment of non-current assets".

## De-recognition of intangible assets

Intangible assets are de-recognised either on their disposal or where no future economic bene�ts are expected from their use. Losses arising on such de-recognition are recorded in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, and are measured as the di�erence between the net disposal proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of respective intangible assets as at the date of de-recognition.

## h) Leases

As explained in note 1.3(a) above, the Company has changed its accounting policy for leases where the Company is the lessee. The new policy is described below. Refer note 1.3(a) for the impact of the change in accounting policy.

The Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is or contains a lease, which applies, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the identi�ed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company recognises a right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease, i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments to be made over the lease term:

- · �xed payments (including in-substance �xed payments), less any lease incentives receivable
- · variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate, initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date
- · amounts expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees
- · the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and
- · payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term re�ects the Company exercising that option.

The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be readily determined, which is generally the case for leases in the Company, then the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used. Such borrowing rate is calculated as the rate that the individual lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment with similar terms, security and conditions. The Company's lease liabilities are included in borrowings.

Lease payments are allocated between principal and interest cost. The interest cost is charged to pro�t or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

Right-of-use assets are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment comprised of the following:

- · the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability
- · any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received
- · any initial direct costs, and
- · restoration costs.

Right-of-use assets are generally depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.

Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and vehicles and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of o�ce furniture.

The right-of-use assets are initially recognised on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, which is calculated as the amount of the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease, any lease incentive received and any initial direct costs incurred by the Company.

## i) Inventories

Inventories consist of raw materials, stores and spares, work-in-progress and �nished goods and are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of all categories of inventories is based on the weighted average method. Cost includes expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location and condition. In the case of �nished goods and work-in-progress, cost includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal operating capacity. Stores and spares consists of packing materials, engineering spares (such as machinery spare parts) and consumables (such as lubricants, cotton waste and oils), which are used in operating machines or consumed as indirect materials in the manufacturing process.

Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.

The factors that the Company considers in determining the provision for slow moving, obsolete and other non-saleable inventory include estimated shelf life, planned product discontinuances, price changes, ageing of inventory and introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. The Company considers all these factors and adjusts the inventory provision to re�ect its actual experience on a periodic basis.

## j) Impairment

## �on-�nancial assets

The carrying amounts of the Company's non-�nancial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. For goodwill and intangible assets that have inde�nite lives or that are not yet available for use, an impairment test is performed each year at 31 March.

The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (as de�ned below) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash �ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re�ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci�c to the asset or the cash-generating unit. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generate cash in�ows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash in�ows of other assets or groups of assets (the �cash-generating unit�).

The goodwill acquired in a business combination is, for the purpose of impairment testing, allocated to cash-generating units that are expected to bene�t from the synergies of the combination.

An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss if the estimated recoverable amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit is lower than its carrying amount. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated �rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units and then to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis.

An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. Goodwill that forms part of the carrying amount of an investment in joint venture is not recognised separately, and therefore is not tested for impairment separately. Instead, the entire amount of the investment in joint venture is tested for impairment as a single asset when there is objective evidence that the investment in joint venture may be impaired.

An impairment loss in respect of equity accounted investee is measured by comparing the recoverable amount of investment with its carrying amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, and reversed if there has been a favourable change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.

## k) Employee �ene�t�

## Short-term employee bene�ts

Short-term employee bene�ts are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid if the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.

## �e�ned contribution plans

The Company's contributions to de�ned contribution plans are charged to the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as and when the services are received from the employees.

## �e�ned bene�t plans

The liability in respect of de�ned bene�t plans and other post-employment bene�ts is calculated using the projected unit credit method consistent with the advice of quali�ed actuaries. The present value of the de�ned bene�t obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash out�ows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the bene�ts will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related de�ned bene�t obligation. In countries where there is no deep market in such bonds, the market interest rates on government bonds are used. The current service cost of the de�ned bene�t plan, recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss in employee bene�t expense, re�ects the increase in the de�ned bene�t obligation resulting from employee service in the current year, bene�t changes, curtailments and settlements. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the de�ned bene�t obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee bene�t expense in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions for de�ned bene�t obligation and plan assets are recognised in OCI in the period in which they arise.

When the bene�ts under a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in bene�t that relates to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss. The Company recognises gains or losses on the settlement of a de�ned bene�t plan obligation when the settlement occurs.

## Termination bene�ts

Termination bene�ts are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss when the Company is demonstrably committed, without realistic possibility of withdrawal, to a formal detailed plan to either terminate employment before the normal retirement date, or to provide termination bene�ts as a result of an o�er made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Termination bene�ts for voluntary redundancies are recognised as an expense in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss if the Company has made an o�er encouraging voluntary redundancy, it is probable that the o�er will be accepted, and the number of acceptances can be estimated reliably.

## Other long-term employee bene�ts

The Company's net obligation in respect of other long-term employee bene�ts is the amount of future bene�t that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and previous periods. That bene�t is discounted to determine its present value. Re-measurements are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss in the period in which they arise.

## Compensated absences

The Company's current policies permit certain categories of its employees to accumulate and carry forward a portion of their unutilised compensated absences and utilise them in future periods or receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with the terms of such policies. The Company measures the expected cost of accumulating compensated absences as the additional amount that the Company incurs as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. Such measurement is based on actuarial valuation as at the reporting date carried out by a quali�ed actuary.

## Equity settled share-based payment transactions

The grant date fair value of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re�ect the number of awards for which the related service and performance conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised is based on the number of awards that meet the related service and performance conditions at the vesting date. The expense is recorded for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The increase in equity recognised in connection with share-based payment transaction is presented as a separate component in equity under "share-based payment reserve". The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to re�ect the actual number of stoc� options that vest.

## Cash settled share-based payment transactions

The fair value of the amount payable to employees in respect of share-based payment transactions which are settled in cash is recognised as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities, over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.

The liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the settlement date based on the fair value of the share-based payment transaction. Any changes in the liability are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

## l) Provisions

A provision is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an out�ow of economic bene�ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the e�ect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash �ows at a pre-tax rate that re�ects current mar�et assessments of the time value of money and the ris�s speci�c to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a �nance cost.

## Restructuring

A provision for restructuring is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss when the Company has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs are not provided.

## Onerous contracts

A provision for onerous contracts is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss when the expected bene�ts to be derived by the Company from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Company recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

## Reimbursement rights

Expected reimbursements for expenditures required to settle a provision are recognised in the consolidate statement of pro�t and loss only when receipt of such reimbursements is virtually certain. Such reimbursements are recognised as a separate asset in the balance sheet, with a corresponding credit to the speci�c expense for which the provision has been made.

## Contingent liabilities and contingent assets

A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an out�ow of resources. Where there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the li�elihood of out�ow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

Contingent assets are not recognised in the consolidated �nancial statements. A contingent asset is disclosed where an in�ow of economic bene�ts is probable. Contingent assets are assessed continually and, if it is virtually certain that an in�ow of economic bene�ts will arise, the asset and related income are recognised in the period in which the change occurs.

## m) Revenue

The Company's revenue is derived from sales of goods, service income and income from licensing arrangements. Most of such revenue is generated from the sale of goods. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements.

## Sale of goods

Revenue is recognised when the control of the goods has been transferred to a third party. This is usually when the title passes to the customer, either upon shipment or upon receipt of goods by the customer. At that point, the customer has full discretion over the channel and price to sell the products, and there are no unful�lled obligations that could a�ect the customer's acceptance of the product.

Revenue from the sale of goods is measured at the transaction price which is the consideration received or receivable, net of returns, taxes and applicable trade discounts and allowances. Revenue includes shipping and handling costs billed to the customer.

In arriving at the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract with the customers and its customary business practices. The transaction price is the amount of consideration the Company is entitled to receive in exchange for transferring promised goods or services, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The amount of consideration varies because of estimated rebates, returns and chargebacks, which are considered to be key estimates. Any amount of variable consideration is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi�cant reversal will not occur. The Company estimates the amount of variable consideration using the expected value method.

Presented below are the points of recognition of revenue with respect to the Company's sale of goods:

## Pro�t share revenues

The Company from time to time enters into marketing arrangements with certain business partners for the sale of its products in certain markets. Under such arrangements, the Company sells its products to the business partners at a non-refundable base purchase price agreed upon in the arrangement and is also entitled to a pro�t share which is over and above the base purchase price. The pro�t share is typically dependent on the business partner's ultimate net sale proceeds or net pro�ts, subject to any reductions or adjustments that are required by the terms of the arrangement. Such arrangements typically require the business partner to provide con�rmation of units sold and net sales or net pro�t computations for the products covered under the arrangement.

Revenue in an amount equal to the base sale price is recognised in these transactions upon delivery of products to the business partners. An additional amount representing the pro�t share component is recognised as revenue only to the extent that it is highly probable that a signi�cant reversal will not occur.

At the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the estimated transaction price (including updating its assessment of whether an estimate of variable consideration is constrained) to represent faithfully the circumstances present at the end of the reporting period and the changes in circumstances during the reporting period.

## Out licensing arrangements, milestone payments and royalties

Revenues include amounts derived from product out-licensing agreements. These arrangements typically consist of an initial up-front payment on inception of the license and subsequent payments dependent on achieving certain milestones in accordance with the terms prescribed in the agreement. In cases where the transaction has two or more components, the Company accounts for the delivered item (for example, the transfer of title to the intangible asset) as a separate unit of accounting and record revenue upon delivery of that component, provided that the Company can make a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the undelivered component. Otherwise, non-refundable up-front license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements are deferred and recognised over the balance period in which the Company has pending performance obligations. Milestone payments which are contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are recognised as revenues either on achievement of such milestones, over the performance period depending on the terms of the contract. If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.

Royalty income earned through a license is recognised when the underlying sales have occurred.

Provision for chargeback, rebates and discounts

Provisions for chargeback, rebates, discounts and Medicaid payments are estimated and provided for in the year of sales and recorded as reduction of revenue. A chargeback claim is a claim made by the wholesaler for the di�erence between the price at which the product is initially invoiced to the wholesaler and the net price at which it is agreed to be procured from the Company. Provisions for such chargebacks are accrued and estimated based on historical average chargeback rate actually claimed over a period of time, current contract prices with wholesalers/other customers and estimated inventory holding by the wholesaler.

## Shelf stock adjustments

Shelf stock adjustments are credits issued to customers to re�ect decreases in the selling price of products sold by the Company, and are accrued when the prices of certain products decline as a result of increased competition or otherwise. These credits are customary in the pharmaceutical industry, and are intended to reduce the customer inventory cost to better re�ect the current market prices. The determination to grant a shelf stock adjustment to a customer is based on the terms of the applicable contract, which may or may not speci�cally limit the age of the stock on which a credit would be o�ered.

## Refund Liability

The Company accounts for sales returns accrual by recording refund liability concurrent with the recognition of revenue at the time of a product sale. This liability is based on the Company's estimate of expected sales returns. The Company deals in various products and operates in various markets. Accordingly, the estimate of sales returns is determined primarily by the Company's historical experience in the markets in which the Company operates. With respect to established products, the Company considers its historical experience of actual sales returns, levels of inventory in the distribution channel, estimated shelf life, any revision in the shelf life of the product, product discontinuances, price changes of competitive products, and the introduction of competitive new products, to the extent each of these factors impact the Company's business and markets. With respect to new products introduced by the Company, such products have historically been either extensions of an existing line of product where the Company has historical experience or in therapeutic categories where established products exist and are sold either by the Company or the Company's competitors. At the time of recognising the refund liability, the Company also recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods) which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

## Services

Revenue from services rendered, which primarily relate to contract research, is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as the underlying services are performed. Upfront non-refundable payments received under these arrangements are deferred and recognised as revenue over the expected period over which the related services are expected to be performed.

## License fees

License fees primarily consist of income from the out-licensing of intellectual property, and other licensing and supply arrangements with various parties. Revenue from license fees is recognised when control transfers to the third party and the Company's performance obligations are satis�ed. Some of these arrangements include certain performance obligations by the Company. Revenue from such arrangements is recognised in the period in which the Company completes all its performance obligations.

## n) Shipping and handling costs

Shipping and handling costs incurred to transport products to customers, and internal transfer costs incurred to transport the products from the Company's factories to its various points of sale, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

## o) Othe� income and �nance cost

Other income consists of interest income on funds invested, dividend income and gains on the disposal of assets. Interest income is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as it accrues, using the e�ective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss on the date that the Company's right to receive payment is established. The associated cash �ows are classi�ed as investing activities in the statement of cash �ows. Finance expenses consist of interest expense on loans and borrowings.

Borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss using the e�ective interest method. The associated cash �ows are classi�ed as �nancing activities in the statement of cash �ows.

Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis within other income and / or selling and other expenses. These primarily include: exchange di�erences arising on the settlement or translation of monetary items; changes in the fair value of derivative contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied; and the ine�ective portion of cash �ow hedges.

## p) Income tax

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary di�erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for �nancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary di�erences:

- · temporary di�erences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that a�ects neither accounting nor taxable pro�t;
- · temporary di�erences relating to investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and
- · taxable temporary di�erences arising upon the initial recognition of goodwill.

Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary di�erences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are o�set if there is a legally enforceable right to o�set current tax liabilities and assets, and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on di�erent tax entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro�ts will be available against which the temporary di�erence can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax will be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that the future taxable pro�ts will allow the deferred tax assets to be recovered.

Any deferred tax asset or liability arising from deductible or taxable temporary di�erences in respect of unrealised inter-company pro�t or loss on inventories held by the Company in di�erent tax jurisdictions is recognised using the tax rate of the jurisdiction in which such inventories are held. Dividend distribution tax arising out of payment of dividends to shareholders under the Indian Income tax regulations is not considered as tax expense for the Company and all such taxes are recognised in the statement of changes in equity as part of the associated dividend payment.

Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in OCI or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in OCI or directly in equity, respectively.

Accruals for uncertain tax positions require management to make judgements of potential exposures. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are measured using either the most likely amount or the expected value amount depending on which method the entity expects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. Tax bene�ts are not recognised unless the tax positions will probably be accepted by the tax authorities. This is based upon management's interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the expectation of how the tax authority will resolve the matter. Once considered probable of not being accepted, management reviews each material tax bene�t and re�ects the e�ect of the uncertainty in determining the related taxable amounts.

## q) Earnings per share

The Company presents basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the pro�t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the pro�t or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the e�ects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which includes all stock options granted to employees.

## r) Government grants and incentives

The Company recognises government grants only when there is reasonable assurance that the conditions attached to them will be complied with, and the grants will be received. Government grants received in relation to assets are presented as a reduction to the carrying amount of the related asset. Grants related to income are deducted in reporting the related expense in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

Export entitlements from government authorities are recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss as a reduction from "Cost of materials consumed" when the right to receive credit as per the terms of the scheme is established in respect of the exports made by the Company, and where there is no signi�cant uncertainty regarding the ultimate collection of the relevant export proceeds.

## s) Segment reporting

Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker. The Chief Executive O�cer of the Company is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and accordingly is identi�ed as the chief operating decision maker.

## t) Treasury shares

Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company's own equity instruments. Any di�erence between the carrying amount and the consideration, if reissued, is recognised in the securities premium.

## u) Non-currents assets held for sale

The Company classi�es non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets classi�ed as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Costs to sell are the incremental costs directly attributable to the disposal of an asset, excluding �nance costs and income tax expense. The criteria for held for sale classi�cation is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable, and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Property, plant and equipment are not depreciated or amortised once classi�ed as held for sale. Assets classi�ed as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the consolidated balance sheet.

## v) Rounding of amounts

All amounts disclosed in the consolidated �nancial statements and notes have been rounded o� to the nearest million unless otherwise stated.

## 1.4 DETERMINATIONOF FAIRVALUES

The Company's accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for certain �nancial and non-�nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is disclosed in the notes speci�c to that asset or liability.

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.

The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.

A fair value measurement of a non-�nancial asset takes into account a market participant�s ability to generate economic bene�ts by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.

The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which su�cient data are available to measure fair value, maximizing the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable inputs.

All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the consolidated �nancial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement as a whole�

- · Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.
- · Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.

For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the consolidated �nancial statements at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorization (based on the lowest level input that is signi�cant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.

External valuers are involved for valuation of signi�cant assets, such as assets acquired in a business combination and signi�cant liabilities, such as contingent consideration. Involvement of external valuers is determined by the Management, based on market knowledge, reputation, independence and whether professional standards are maintained.

## a) Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment, if acquired in a business combination or through an exchange of non-monetary assets, is measured at fair value on the acquisition date. For this purpose, fair value is based on appraised market values and replacement cost.

## b) Intangible assets

The fair value of brands, technology related intangibles, and patents and trademarks acquired in a business combination is based on the discounted estimated royalty payments that have been avoided as a result of these brands, technology related intangibles, patents or trademarks being owned (the "relief of royalty method"). The fair value of customer related, product related and other intangibles acquired in a business combination has been determined using the multi-period excess earnings method. Under this method, value is estimated as the present value of the bene�ts anticipated from ownership of the intangible assets in excess of the returns required or the investment in the contributory assets necessary to realise those bene�ts.

## c) Inventories

The fair value of inventories acquired in a business combination is determined based on its estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and sale, and a reasonable pro�t margin based on the e�ort required to complete and sell the inventories.

## d) Investments in equity and debt securities and units of mutual funds

The fair value of marketable equity and debt securities is determined by reference to their quoted market price at the reporting date. For debt securities where quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using pricing techniques such as discounted cash �ow analysis.

In respect of investments in mutual funds, the fair values represent net asset value as stated by the issuers of these mutual fund units in the published statements. Net asset values represent the price at which the issuer will issue further units in the mutual fund and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors.

Accordingly, such net asset values are analogous to fair market value with respect to these investments, as transactions of these mutual funds are carried out at such prices between investors and the issuers of these units of mutual funds.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

## e) Derivatives

The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is estimated by discounting the di�erence between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk-free interest rate (based on government bonds). The fair value of foreign currency option and swap contracts and interest rate swap contracts is determined based on the appropriate valuation techniques, considering the terms of the contract.

## f) Non-derivative �nancia� �iabi�ities

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash �ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For �nance leases the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements. In respect of the Company's borrowings that have �oating rates of interest, their fair value approximates carrying value.

## g) Share-based payment transactions

The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Measurement inputs include share price on grant date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historical volatility), expected life of the instrument (based on historical experience), expected dividends, and the risk free interest rate (based on government bonds).

## h) Contingent consideration

The fair value of the contingent consideration arising out of business combination is estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on signi�cant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS ��3, �Fair �alue Measurement" refers to as Level 3 inputs.

## 2.2 GOODWILL

Goodwill arising upon business combinations is not amortised but tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if there is any indication that the cash generating unit to which goodwill is allocated is impaired. Gross carrying value and accumulated amortisation with respect to goodwill represent Indian GAAP balances, that have been carried forward as such, relating to business combination entered before the transition date i.e., 1 April 2015.

For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to a cash generating unit, representing the lowest level within the Company at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and which is not higher than the Company's operating segment.

The carrying amount of goodwill (other than those arising upon investment in a joint venture) was allocated to the cash generating units as follows:

| PARTICULARS                              | AS AT 31 MARCH 2021   |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| PSAI-Active Pharmaceutical Operations    | 170                   |
| Global Generics-Complex Injectables      | 1,928                 |
| Global Generics-North America Operations | 308                   |
| Global Generics-Germany Operations       | 2,288                 |
| Global Generics-Branded Formulations     | 905                   |

The recoverable amounts of the above cash generating units have been assessed using a value-in-use model. Value in use is generally calculated as the net present value of the projected post-tax cash �ows plus a terminal value of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated. Initially, a post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the post-tax cash �ows. �ey assumptions upon which the Company has based its determinations of value-in-use include:

- a) Estimated cash �ows for �ve years, based on management's projections.
- b) A terminal value arrived at by extrapolating the last forecasted year cash �ows to perpetuity, using a constant long-term growth rate of 0%. This long-term growth rate takes into consideration external macroeconomic sources of data. Such long-term growth rate considered does not exceed that of the relevant business and industry sector.

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

## 2.2 GOODWILL (CONTINUED)

- c) The after tax discount rates used are based on the Company's weighted average cost of capital.
- d) The after tax discount rates used range from 7.6% to 10.5% for various cash generating units. The pre-tax discount rates range from 9.1% to 15.7%.

The Company believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which a recoverable amount is based would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.

- (1) During the year ended 31 March 2021, additions includes ' 1,471 representing the expenditure for purchase of intellectual property rights relating to Xeglyze® forming part of the Company's Proprietary Products segment.
- During the year ended 31 March 2020, the Company acquired a portfolio of approved, non-marketed Abbreviated New Drug Applications ("ANDAs") in the United States from Teva for a total consideration of ' 277. The Company recognised these ANDAs acquired as product related intangibles.
- (2) During the year ended 31 March 2020, the product ramelton was available for use and are subject to amortisation. Accordingly, the Company reclassi�ed the amount from intangible assets under development to product related intangibles.
- (3) Impairment losses recorded for the year ended 31 March 2021
- Total impairment charges for the year ended 31 March 2021 were ' 6,722 which were recorded in impairment of non-current assets in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, of which ' 3,180 was attributable to impairment of gNuvaring, ' 1,471 was attributable to impairment of Xeglyze® and the balance of ' 2,071 was attributable to other product related intangibles.

## Impairment of gNuvaring

During the year ended 31 March 2021, there were signi�cant changes to the generics market for Ethinyl estradiol/Ethenogestral vaginal ring (a generic equivalent to Nuvaring®), one of the 8 ANDAs acquired from Teva in June 2016. The changes include the launch by a competitor of a generic version of the product in January 2021. Due to these adverse market developments, the Company tested the carrying value of this product at the product cash generating unit ("CGU") level, being the smallest identi�able group of assets that generate cash in�ows that are largely independent of the cash in�ows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount was determined by reference to the product's value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell, whichever is higher. This resulted in the value-in-use being the recoverable value of the product. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of ' 3,180 for the year ended 31 March 2021. This impairment loss pertained to the Company's Global Generics segment. With this impairment, the carrying value of the asset has been reduced to ' Nil.

## Impairment of Xeglyze®

Consequent to the decline in the market potential of the product Xeglyze® forming part of the Company's Proprietary Products segment, the Company recorded an amount of ' 3,291 as impairment loss for the year ended 31 March 2021.

## Other intangible assets

With respect to the saxagliptin/metformin (generic version of Kombiglyze®-XR) and phentermine and topiramate (generic version of Qsymia®), two of the 8 ANDAs acquired from Teva in June 2016, there has been a signi�cant decrease in the market potential of these products, primarily due to higher than expected value erosion. Accordingly, the Company assessed the recoverable amount by revisiting market volume, share and price assumptions for these two products and recorded an amount of ' 1,587 as impairment loss for the year ended 31 March 2021. This impairment loss pertained to the Company's Global Generics segment.

In view of the speci�c triggers occurring in the year with respect to some other product related intangible assets forming part of the Company's Global Generics segment, the Company determined that there was a decrease in the market potential of these products primarily due to higher than expected price erosion and increased competition leading to lower volumes. Consequently, the Company recorded an amount of ' 484 as impairment loss for the year ended 31 March 2021.

The Company used the discounted cash �ow approach to calculate the value-in-use which considered assumptions such as revenue projections, rate of generic penetration, estimated price erosion, the useful life of the asset and the net cash �ows have been discounted based on post tax discount rate.

## Impairment losses recorded for the year ended 31 March 2020

Total impairment charges for the year ended 31 March 2020 were ' 16,757 which were recorded in impairment of non-current assets in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, of which ' 11,137 was attributable to impairment of gNuvaring and the balance of ' 5,620 was attributable to other product related intangibles.

## Impairment of gNuvaring

During the year ended 31 March 2020, there were signi�cant changes to the generics market for Ethinyl estradiol / Ethenogestral vaginal ring (a generic equivalent to Nuvaring®), one of the 8 ANDAs acquired from Teva in June 2016. The changes include the launches by competitors of both generic and authorised generic versions of the product in December 2019. Due to these adverse market developments, as at 31 December 2019, the Company tested the carrying value of this product at the product cash generating unit ("CGU") level, being the smallest identi�able group of assets that generate cash in�ows that are largely independent of the cash in�ows from other assets or groups of assets. The recoverable amount was determined by reference to the product's value-in-use or fair value less costs to sell, whichever is higher. This resulted in the value-in-use being the recoverable value of the product. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of ' 11,137 for the year ended 31 March 2020. This impairment loss pertained to the Company's Global Generics segment.

The carrying value of the asset after the impairment was ' 3,269.

The Company used the discounted cash �ow approach to calculate the value in use, with the assistance of independent appraisers. The key assumptions considered in the calculation are as follows:

- a. Weighted average of probability adjusted revenue projections which take into consideration di�erent scenarios such as the base case, the upside case and the downside case;
- b. Rate of generic penetration and estimated price erosion throughout the period;
- c. Estimate of useful life over which the product is expected to generate cash �ows; and
- d. the net cash �ows have been discounted based on a post-tax discounting tax rate of 8%.

## Other intangible assets

In June 2019, the Company launched tobramycin inhalation solution, USP, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of TOBI ® (tobramycin) Inhalation Solution, and in July 2019 the Company launched ramelteon tablets, 8 mg, a therapeutically equivalent generic version of Rozerem ® (ramelteon, 8 mg) Tablets. Subsequent to their respective launches, both products experienced adverse market conditions, such as increased competition and reduced selling prices by competitors. As a result, the performance of the products was signi�cantly lower than the Company's prior estimates. Furthermore, the Company decided to drop the launch of its planned imiquimod cream product. Accordingly, the Company assessed the recoverable amount of intangible assets associated with these three products, and recognised an impairment loss of ' 4,385 (US$ 61.4 million) for the year ended 31 March 2020. These impairment losses pertained to the Company's Global Generics segment.

In view of the speci�c triggers occurring in the year with respect to some of other product related intangible assets forming part of the Company's Global Generics and Proprietary Products segments, the Company determined that there was a decrease in the market potential of these products primarily due to higher than expected price erosion and increased competition leading to lower volumes. Consequently, the Company recorded an amount of ' 1,235 as impairment loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

Consequent to the materiality of the amount involved, these impairment amounts have been disclosed separately in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

Pursuant to an arrangement with a bank, the Company sells to the bank certain of its trade receivables forming part of its Global Generics segment, on a non-recourse basis. The receivables sold were mutually agreed upon with the bank after considering the creditworthiness and contractual terms with the customer including any gross to net adjustments due to rebates, discounts etc. from the contracted amounts. As a result, the receivables sold are generally lower than the total net amount of trade receivables. The Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such receivables sold to the bank and accordingly, the same are derecognised in the consolidated balance sheet. As on 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the amount of trade receivables de-recognised pursuant to the aforesaid arrangement was ' 9,254 (US$ 127million) and ' 9,049 (US$ 120 million), respectively.

In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company uses the expected credit loss ("ECL") model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on its trade receivables or any contractual right to receive cash or another �nancial asset that result from transactions that are within the scope of Ind AS 115. For this purpose, the Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss amount for trade receivables. The provision matrix takes into account external and internal credit risk factors and historical data of credit losses from various customers. The details of changes in allowance for credit losses during the year ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 are as follows:

- * Currently, the Company does not separately track provisions and adjustments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks. However, the adjustments are expected to be non-material. The volumes used to calculate the closing balance of chargebacks represent approximately 1.3 months equivalent of sales, which corresponds to the pending chargeback claims yet to be processed.
- ** Currently, the Company does not separately track the credits and payments, in each case to the extent relating to prior years for chargebacks, rebates, medicaid payments or refund liability.
- (1) Chargebacks provisions for the year ended 31 March 2020 were higher compared to the year ended 31 March 2019, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes, which were partially o�set due to a lower pricing rates per unit for chargebacks. Such lower pricing was primarily on account of a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products. The chargebacks payments for the year ended 31 March 2020 were lower compared to the year ended 31 March 2019, primarily as a result of higher pending chargebacks claims at 31 March 2020 as compared to 31 March 2019. The rebates provisions and the payments for the year ended 31 March 2020 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2019, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for rebates due to a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products which were partially o�set by higher sales volumes during the year ended 31 March 2020 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2019.
- (2) Charge backs provisions and payments for the year ended 31 March 2021 were each higher as compared to the year ended 31 March 2020, primarily as a result of higher sales volumes and also due to higher pricing rates per unit for chargebacks, due to reduction in the contract prices through which the product is resold in the retail part of the supply chain for certain of the Company's products. The rebates provisions and payments for the year ended 31 March 2021 were each lower as compared to the year ended 31 March 2020, primarily as a result of lower pricing rates per unit for rebates, due to a reduction in the invoice price to wholesalers for certain of the Company's products and also due to reduction in the contract prices through which the product is resold in the retail part of the supply chain for certain of the Company's products, which were partially o�-set by higher sales volumes during the year ended 31 March 2021 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2020.

The Company's overall refund liability as of 31 March 2021 relating to its North America Generics business was US$ 19 million, as compared to a liability of US$ 24 million as at 31 March 2020. This decrease in the Company's liability was primarily attributable to a lower refund liability allowance for the year ended 31 March 2021 as compared to the year ended 31 March 2020. Such allowance change was primarily due to certain product mix changes and recent trends in actual sales returns, together with the Company's historical experience, and also the price reduction for certain products resulting into lower refund liability to be carried.

The estimates of "gross-to-net" adjustments for the Company's operations in India and other countries outside of the United States relate mainly to refund liability in all such operations, and certain rebates to healthcare insurance providers are speci�c to the Company's German operations. The pattern of such refund liability is generally consistent with the Company's gross sales. In Germany, the rebates to healthcare insurance providers mentioned above are contractually �xed in nature and do not involve signi�cant estimations by the Company.

## Details of contract asset:

As mentioned in the accounting policies for refund liability set forth in note 1.3 (m) of these consolidated �nancial statements, the Company recognises an asset, (i.e., the right to the returned goods), which is included in inventories for the products expected to be returned. The Company initially measures this asset at the former carrying amount of the inventory, less any expected costs to recover the goods, including any potential decreases in the value of the returned goods. Along with re-measuring the refund liability at the end of each reporting period, the Company updates the measurement of the asset recorded for any revisions to its expected level of returns, as well as any additional decreases in the value of the returned products.

As on 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the Company had ' 37 and ' 23, respectively, as contract assets representing the right to returned goods.

## 2.25 SEGMENT REPORTING

The Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by operating segments. The CODM reviews revenue and gross pro�t as the performance indicator for all of the operating segments, and does not review the total assets and liabilities of an operating segment. The Co-Chairman and Managing Director was previously the CODM of the Company. Pursuant to certain organisational changes, e�ective � December ����, the o�ce of Chief Executive O�cer ("CEO") assumed the authority and responsibility for making decisions about resources to be allocated to various segments and assessing their performance. Consequently, the CEO is currently the CODM of the Company.

The Company's reportable operating segments are as follows:

- Ÿ Global Generics;
- Ÿ Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients ("PSAI");
- Ÿ Proprietary Products; and
- Ÿ Others

Global Generics: This segment consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing prescription and over-the-counter �nished pharmaceutical products ready for consumption by the patient, marketed under a brand name (branded formulations) or as generic �nished dosages with therapeutic equivalence to branded formulations (generics). This segment includes the operations of the Company's biologics business.

Pharmaceutical Services and Active Ingredients: This segment primarily consists of the Company's business of manufacturing and marketing active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates, also known as "API", which are the principal ingredients for �nished pharmaceutical products. Active pharmaceutical ingredients and intermediates become �nished pharmaceutical products when the dosages are �xed in a form ready for human consumption such as a tablet, capsule or liquid using additional inactive ingredients. This segment also includes the Company's contract research services business and the manufacture and sale of active pharmaceutical ingredients and steroids in accordance with the speci�c customer requirements.

Proprietary Products: This segment consists of the Company's business that focuses on the research and development of di�erentiated formulations. The segment is expected to earn revenues arising out of monetisation of such assets and subsequent royalties, if any.

Others: This segment consists of the operations of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Aurigene Discovery Technologies Limited ("ADTL"), a discovery stage biotechnology company developing novel and best-in-class therapies in the �elds of oncology and in�ammation ADTL works with established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through customised models of drug-discovery collaborations.

The measurement of each segment's revenues, expenses and assets is consistent with the accounting policies that are used in preparation of the Company's consolidated �nancial statements.

## Gratuity bene�ts �rovided by the �arent com�any

In accordance with applicable Indian laws, the Company has a de�ned bene�t plan which provides for gratuity payments (the �Gratuity Plan�) and covers certain categories of employees in India. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or termination of their employment. The amount of the payment is based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of employment with the Company. E�ective 1 September 1999, the Company established the Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Gratuity Fund (the �Gratuity Fund�) to fund the Gratuity Plan. Liabilities in respect of the Gratuity Plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company makes contributions to the Gratuity Fund. Trustees administer the contributions made to the Gratuity Fund. Amounts contributed to the Gratuity Fund are invested in bonds issued by the Government of India and in debt securities and equity securities of Indian companies.

The components of gratuity cost recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss for the years ended 31 �arch 2021 and 31 �arch 2020 consist of the following:

The Company instituted the DRL 2002 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting held on 24 September 2001. The DRL 2002 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Committee") administers the DRL 2002 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees. The Committee determines which eligible employees will receive options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2002 Plan vest in periods ranging between one and four years and generally have a maximum contractual term of �ve years.

The DRL 2002 Plan, as amended at annual general meetings of shareholders held on 28 July 2004 and on 27 July 2005, provides for stock option grants in two categories:

Category A: 300,000 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of grant; and

Category B: 1,995,478 stock options out of the total of 2,295,478 options reserved for grant having an exercise price equal to the par value of the underlying equity shares (i.e., ' 5 per option).

Under the DRL 2002 Plan, the exercise price of the fair market value options granted under Category A above is determined based on the average closing price for 30 days prior to the grant in the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume during that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may, after obtaining the approval of the shareholders in the annual general meeting, grant options with a per share exercise price other than fair market value and par value of the equity shares.

## Dr. Reddy's Employees Stock Option Scheme, 2018 (the "DRL 2018 Plan")

The Company instituted the DRL 2018 Plan for all eligible employees pursuant to the special resolution approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting held on 27 July 2018. The DRL 2018 Plan covers all employees and directors (excluding independent and promoter directors) of the parent company and its subsidiaries (collectively, "eligible employees"). Upon the exercise of options granted under the DRL 2018 Plan, the applicable equity shares may be issued directly by the Company to the eligible employee or may be transferred from the Dr. Reddy's Employees ESOS Trust (the "ESOS Trust") to the eligible employee. The ESOS Trust may acquire such equity shares through primary issuances by the Company and/or by way of secondary market acquisitions funded through loans from the Company. The Nomination, Governance and Compensation Committee of the Board of the parent company (the "Compensation Committee") administers the DRL 2018 Plan and grants stock options to eligible employees, but may delegate functions and powers relating to the administration of the DRL 2018 Plan to the ESOS Trust. The Compensation Committee determines which eligible employees will receive the options, the number of options to be granted, the exercise price, the vesting period and the exercise period. The vesting period is determined for all options issued on the date of grant. The options issued under the DRL 2018 Plan vest in periods ranging between the end of one and �ve years, and generally have a maximum contractual term of �ve years.

The DRL 2018 Plan provides for option grants having an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying equity shares on the date of

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 was ' 1,255 and ' 994 per option, respectively. The weighted average share price on the date of exercise of options during the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 was ' 4,609 and ' 2,914 per share, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 was ' 165 and ' 0.35, respectively. As of 31 March 2021, options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 563 and options exercisable had an aggregate intrinsic value of ' 104.

## Valuation of stock options:

The fair value of services received in return for stock options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of stock options granted. The fair value of stock options granted under the DRL 2002 Plan, the DRL 2007 Plan and the DRL 2018 Plan has been measured using the Black-Scholes-Merton model at the date of the grant.

The Black-Scholes-Merton model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields, expected volatility, expected terms and risk free interest rates. In respect of par value options granted, the expected term of an option (or "option life") is estimated based on the vesting term and contractual term, as well as the expected exercise behavior of the employees receiving the option. In respect of fair market value options granted, the option life is estimated based on the simpli�ed method. Expected volatility of the option is based on historical volatility, during a period equivalent to the option life, of the observed market prices of the Company's publicly traded equity shares. Dividend yield of the options is based on recent dividend activity.

Risk-free interest rates are based on the government securities yield in e�ect at the time of the grant. These assumptions re�ect management's best estimates, but these assumptions involve inherent market uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the Company's control. As a result, if other assumptions had been used in the current period, stock-based compensation expense could have been materially impacted. Further, if management uses di�erent assumptions in future periods, stock-based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future years.

The estimated fair value of stock options is recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in-substance, multiple awards.

- (1) India's Finance Act, 2016 incorporated an amendment that reduces the weighted deduction on eligible research and development expenditure in a phased manner from 200% to 150% commencing from 1 April 2017, and from 150% to 100% e�ective 1 April 2020�

The Company's e�ective tax rate for the year ended 31 March 2021 was higher as compared to the year ended 31 March 2020 primarily on account of:

- Ÿ de-recognition of deferred tax asset during the year ended 31 March 2021 due to non-availability of depreciation on goodwill pursuant to an amendment to section 2(11) of the Income Tax Act in the Finance Act, 2021;
- Ÿ recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the Minimum Alternate Tax ("MAT") credits and planned restructuring activity between companies of our group during the year ended 31 March 2020;
- Ÿ weighted deduction on eligible research and development expenditure in Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, India for the year 31 March 2020; and
- Ÿ income from sale of capital assets during the year ended 31 March 2020, which was set o� against the carried forward capital loss.

## 2.29 INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

During the year ended 31 March 2021, the Company recognised deferred tax assets on operating tax losses pertaining Dr. Reddy's Laboratories New York, Inc. as the Company believes that it is probable that there will be available taxable pro�ts against which such tax losses can be utilised.

During the year ended 31 March 2021, the Company did not recognise deferred tax assets on operating tax losses and other deductible temporary di�erences pertaining primarily to Dr. Reddy's Laboratories SA, Swit�erland and Dr. Reddy's Research and Development B.�., Netherlands.

Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of ' 22,099 and ' 23,615 as at 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, respectively, of subsidiaries, where it is expected that earnings of the subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. Generally, the Company inde�nitely reinvests all of the accumulated undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, and accordingly, has not recorded any deferred taxes in relation to such undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries.

## e) Deferred tax assets and liabilities

The tax e�ects of signi�cant temporary di�erences that resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities and a description of the items that created these di�erences is given below:

In assessing whether the deferred income tax assets will be realised, management considers whether some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of the deferred income tax assets and tax loss carry forwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the temporary di�erences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategy in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that the Company will realise the bene�ts of those recognised deductible di�erences and tax loss carry forwards. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of future taxable income. Any changes in such future taxable income would impact the recoverability of deferred tax assets.

Operating loss carry forward consists of business losses, unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed interest carry-forwards. A portion of this total loss can be carried inde�nitely and the remaining amounts expire at various dates ranging from 2022 through 203�.

The amounts recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss for the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 include ' (96) and ' 106 respectively, which represent exchange di�erences arising due to foreign currency translations.

## g) Uncertain tax positions

The Company is contesting various disallowances by the Indian Income Tax authorities. The associated tax impact for disallowances being more likely than not to be accepted by Tax authorities is ' 2,291, and accordingly, no provision is made in these �nancial statements as of 31 March 2021.

During the years ended 31 March 2014, 2015 and 2016, Industrias Quimicas Falcon de Mexico, S.A. de CV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in Mexico, received a notice from Mexico's Tax Administration Service, Servicio de Administracion Tributaria ("SAT"), with respect to disallowance on account of transfer pricing adjustments pertaining to the calendar years ended 31 December 2006, 31 December 2007 and 31 December 2008. The associated tax impact is ' 801 (MXN 224 million) and pro�t share impact is ' 89 (MXN 25 million). The Company �led administrative appeals with the SAT by challenging these disallowances and, during February and March 2017, the Company received orders of the SAT con�rming these disallowances by dismissing its administrative appeals. The Company disagrees with the SAT's disallowances and �led an appeal with the Tribunal Federal de �usticia Administrativa (Federal Tax and Administrative Court of Mexico) in March and April 2017. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that it would prevail over the SAT in this litigation. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated �nancial statements as of 31 March 2021.

## Hedges of changes in the interest rates

Consistent with its risk management policy, the Company uses interest rate swaps (including cross currency interest rate swaps) to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The Company does not use them for trading or speculative purposes.

A net gain/loss of ' Nil, representing the changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps used as hedging instrument in a cash �ow hedge is recognised in the statement of other comprehensive income. For balance interest rate swaps, the changes in fair value (including cross currency interest rate swaps) are recognised as part of the foreign exchange gains and losses and �nance costs. Accordingly the Company has recorded, as part of consolidated statement of pro�t and loss, a net gain of ' 164 and a net gain of ' 33 for the year ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020 respectively.

The Company had outstanding cross currency swap against INR Borrowing of ' 7,240 as at 31 March 2021 and ' Nil as on 31st March 2020. The swap hedges the principal repayment of underlying INR liability and transforms it into USD Principal repayment liability.

## 2.31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT

The Company's activities expose it to a variety of �nancial risks, including market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's primary risk management focus is to minimise potential adverse e�ects of market risk on its �nancial performance. The Company's risk management assessment and policies and processes are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor such risks and compliance with the same. Risk assessment and management policies and processes are reviewed regularly to re�ect changes in market conditions and the Company's activities. The Board of Directors and the Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the Company's risk assessment and management policies and processes.

## 2.31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

## a. Market risk

Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash �ows that may result from adverse changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices) or in the price of market risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable to all market risk-sensitive �nancial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company's exposure to market risk is a function of investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.

## Foreign exchange risk

The Company's foreign exchange risk arises from its foreign operations, foreign currency revenues and expenses, (U.K. pounds sterling, Russian roubles, Brazilian reals, Swiss francs, South African rands, Kazakhstan tenges, Romanian new leus, Austrailian dollars and Euros) and foreign currency borrowings (in United States dollars, Russian roubles, South African rands, Mexican pesos, Ukrainian hryvnias and Brazilian reals). A signi�cant portion of the Company's revenues are in these foreign currencies, while a signi�cant portion of its costs are in Indian rupees. As a result, if the value of the Indian rupee appreciates relative to these foreign currencies, the Company's revenues measured in Indian rupees may decrease. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and these foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent periods and may continue to �uctuate substantially in the future. Consequently, the Company uses both derivative and non-derivative �nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, option contracts, currency swap contracts and foreign currency �nancial liabilities, to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in respect of its highly probable forecast transactions and recognised assets and liabilities.

The details in respect of the outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts are given in note 2.30 to these consolidated �nancial statements.

In respect of the Company's forward and option contracts, a 10% decrease/increase in the respective exchange rates of each of the currencies underlying such contracts would have resulted in:

- Ÿ A ' 4,824/(4,195) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 2,658/(2,658) increase/(decrease) in the Company's pro�t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2021;
- Ÿ A ' 1,203/(1,740) increase/(decrease) in the Company's hedging reserve and a ' 2,070/(1,745) increase/(decrease) in the Company's pro�t from such contracts, as at 31 March 2020.

The following table analyses foreign currency risk from non-derivative �nancial instruments as at 31 March 2021:

## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

## 2.31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

For the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, every 10% depreciation/appreciation in the exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the respective currencies for the above mentioned �nancial assets/liabilities would a�ect the Company�s net pro�t by ' 2,595 and ' 1,710, respectively.

## Interest rate risk

As of 31 March 2021, the Company had loans with �oating interest rates as follows: ' 8,800 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of 3 Months India Treasury Bill plus 30 bps and ' 1,896 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of TIIE�1.20%.

As of 31 March 2020, the Company had loans with �oating interest rates as follows: ' 10,971 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate ranging from 1 Month LIBOR plus 12.5 bps to 1 Month LIBOR plus 82.7 bps; ' 4,000 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of 1 Month India Treasury Bill plus 60 bps; ' 1,627 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of 3 Month LIBOR plus 55 bps; ' 1,579 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of TIIE�1.25%, and ' 63 of loans carrying a �oating interest rate of 1 Month �IBAR plus 120 bps.

For details of the Company's short-term and long-term loans and borrowings, including interest rate pro�les, refer note 2.10 A and B of these consolidated �nancial statements.

For the years ended 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, every 10% increase or decrease in the �oating interest rate component (i.e., LIBOR, �IBAR, Treasury Bill and TIIE) applicable to its loans and borrowings would a�ect the Company's net pro�t by ' 37 and ' 41.

The carrying value of the Company's borrowings, interest component of which was designated in a cash �ow hedge, was ' Nil as of 31 March 2021 and as on 31 March 2020.

The Company's investments in term deposits (i.e., certi�cates of deposit) with banks and short-term liquid mutual funds are for short durations, and therefore do not expose the Company to signi�cant interest rates risk.

## Commodity rate risk

Exposure to market risk with respect to commodity prices primarily arises from the Company's purchases and sales of active pharmaceutical ingredients, including the raw material components for such active pharmaceutical ingredients. These are commodity products, whose prices may �uctuate signi�cantly over short periods of time. The prices of the Company's raw materials generally �uctuate in line with commodity cycles, although the prices of raw materials used in the Company's active pharmaceutical ingredients business are generally more volatile. Cost of raw materials forms the largest portion of the Company's operating expenses. Commodity price risk exposure is evaluated and managed through operating procedures and sourcing policies. As of 31 March 2021, the Company had not entered into any material derivative contracts to hedge exposure to �uctuations in commodity prices.

## b. Credit risk

Credit risk is the risk of �nancial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a �nancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investment securities. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful debts and impairment that represents its estimate of expected losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments.

## Trade and other receivables

The Company's exposure to credit risk is in�uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The demographics of the customer, including the default risk of the industry and country in which the customer operates, also has an in�uence on credit risk assessment. Credit risk is managed through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously monitoring the creditworthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business.

## Investments

The Company limits its exposure to credit risk by generally investing in liquid securities and only with counterparties that have a good credit rating. The Company does not expect any losses from non-performance by these counter-parties, and does not have any signi�cant concentration of exposures to speci�c industry sectors or speci�c country risks.

## Details of �nan�ial assets �not d�e� �ast d�e and im�aired

None of the Company's cash equivalents, including term deposits (i.e., certi�cates of deposit) with banks, were past due or impaired as at 31 March 2021. The Company's credit period for trade receivables payable by its customers generally ranges from 20 -180 days.

The ageing of trade receivables is given below:

## 2.31 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (CONTINUED)

See Note 2.6 B of these consolidated �nancial statements for the activity in the allowance for credit losses.

Other than trade receivables, the Company has no signi�cant class of �nancial assets that is past due but not impaired.

## c. Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its �nancial obligations as they become due. The Company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have su�cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risk to the Company's reputation.

As of 31 March 2021 and 31 March 2020, the Company had uncommitted lines of credit from banks of ' 38,766 and ' 39,374 respectively.

As of 31 March 2021, the Company had working capital of ' 64,314 (excluding assets held for sale of ' 151), including cash and cash equivalents of ' 14,829, investments in term deposits with banks, bonds and commercial paper of ' 6,481, and investments in mutual funds of ' 13,263.

As of 31 March 2020, the Company had working capital of ' 53,850, including cash and cash equivalents of ' 2,053, investments in term deposits with banks, bonds and commercial paper of ' 7,862, investments in marked linked debentures of ' 1,993 and investments in mutual funds of ' 13,832.

The table below provides details regarding the contractual maturities of signi�cant �nancial liabilities (other than long-term borrowings and obligations under leases, which have been disclosed in note 2.10 A to these consolidated �nancial statements) as at 31 March 2021:

## 2.32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

## A. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES (CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY NOT ACKNOWLEDGED AS DEBTS)

The Company is involved in disputes, lawsuits, claims, governmental and/or regulatory inspections, inquiries, investigations and proceedings, including patent and commercial matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The more signi�cant matters are discussed below. Most of the claims involve complex issues. Often, these issues are subject to uncertainties and therefore the probability of a loss, if any, being sustained and an estimate of the amount of any loss is di�cult to ascertain. Consequently, for a majority of these claims, it is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the expected �nancial e�ect, if any, that will result from ultimate resolution of the proceedings. This is due to a number of factors, including: the stage of the proceedings (in many cases trial dates have not been set) and the overall length and extent of pre-trial discovery; the entitlement of the parties to an action to appeal a decision; clarity as to theories of liability; damages and governing law; uncertainties in timing of litigation; and the possible need for further legal proceedings to establish the appropriate amount of damages, if any. In these cases, the Company based on internal and external legal advice discloses information with respect to the nature and facts of the case.

The Company also believes that disclosure of the amount sought by plainti�s, if that is known, would not be meaningful with respect to those legal proceedings.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings or investigations referred to in this Note, the Company does not expect them to have a materially adverse e�ect on its �nancial position, as it believes that the likelihood of loss in excess of amounts accrued (if any) is not probable. However, if one or more of such proceedings were to result in judgements against the Company, such judgements could be material to its results of operations in a given period.

## (i) Product and patent related matters

## Launch of product

On 14 June 2018, the U.S. FDA granted the Company �nal approval for buprenorphine and naloxone sublingual �lm, 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg, 8 ® mg/2 mg, and 12 mg/3 mg dosages, a therapeutic equivalent generic version of Suboxone sublingual �lm. The U.S. FDA approval came after the conclusion of litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the "Delaware District Court"), where the Delaware District Court held ® that patents covering Suboxone sublingual �lm would not be infringed by the Company's commercial launch of its generic sublingual �lm product. In light of the favourable decision from the Delaware District Court, the Company launched its generic sublingual �lm product in the United States immediately following the U.S. FDA approval on 14 June 2018. On July 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ® ("the Court of Appeals") a�rmed the Delaware District Court's ruling that the Company's generic version of Suboxone sublingual �lms did not infringe the two remaining patents at issue in the Delaware District Court's case (U.S. patent numbers 8,603,514 and 8,015,150).

## 2.32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

After the Delaware District Court's decision, Indivior �led a second lawsuit against the Company alleging infringement of three additional U.S. patents (numbers 9,687,454, 9,855,221 and 9,931,305) in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the "New Jersey District Court"), styled Indivior Inc. et al. v. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories S.A., Civil Action No. 2:17-cv-07111 (D.N.J.). Following the launch, on 15 June 2018, Indivior �led an emergency application for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the Company in the New Jersey District Court. Indivior's motion alleged that the Company's generic sublingual �lm product infringed one of three U.S. patents (number 9,931,305) at issue in the New Jersey District Court. Pending a hearing and decision on the injunction application, the New Jersey District Court initially issued a temporary restraining order against the Company with respect to further sales, o�er for sales, and imports of its generic sublingual �lm product in the United States. Subsequently, on 14 July 2018, the New Jersey District Court granted a preliminary injunction in favour of Indivior. Under the order, Indivior was required to and did post a bond of US$72 to pay the costs and damages sustained by the Company if it was found to be wrongfully enjoined. The Company immediately appealed the decision, and the Court of Appeals agreed to expedite the appeal.

On 20 November 2018, the Court of Appeals issued a decision vacating the preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals denied Indivior's petition for rehearing on 4 February 2019.

Indivior subsequently �led two emergency motions in the Court of Appeals to stay issuance of the mandate and to keep the preliminary injunction in place, which the Court of Appeals denied. Indivior then petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to stay issuance of the mandate.

Indivior's petition was denied by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court on 19 February 2019, and the mandate was issued on the same day. The Company resumed sales of its generic sublingual �lm product after the mandate was issued.

On 19 February 2019, the New Jersey District Court entered a stipulated order of dismissal of Indivior's claims under U.S. patent number 9,855,221. On 5 November 2019, the New Jersey District Court issued its claim construction decision construing certain terms in U.S. patent numbers 9,931,305 and 9,687,454. After such claim construction decision, on 8 January 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered a stipulated order that the Company's generic sublingual �lm product does not infringe the asserted claims in U.S. patent number 9,931,305. In the stipulated order, Indivior reserved the ability to appeal the New Jersey District Court's claim construction order. The Company �led a motion requesting that the New Jersey District Court enter partial �nal judgement in the Company's favour relating to the allegations of infringement of U.S. patent number 9,931,305, which the District Court denied without prejudice on 24 August 2020, pending resolution of Indivior's allegations relating to U.S. patent number 9,687,454.

On 11 November 2019, a Magistrate Judge in the District of New Jersey granted the Company leave to �le a counterclaim against Indivior that alleges that Indivior engaged in anticompetitive conduct by making false or misleading statements to the New Jersey District Court during the preliminary injunction proceedings in violation of federal antitrust laws. Indivior appealed the Magistrate Judge's ruling to the District Court Judge and, on 24 August 2020, the District Court Judge denied Indivior's appeal. The District Court did grant Indivior's motion to bifurcate the patent claims and the antitrust claims into two separate trials. Fact discovery closed on 29 January 2021. No trial date has been set and expert discovery on both the patent and antitrust claims is ongoing. Opening expert reports were submitted on 24 March 2021. Expert discovery is scheduled to close on or around 01 September 2021.

In addition to the District Court proceeding, on 13 November 2018, the Company �led two petitions for inter-partes review challenging the validity of certain claims of U.S. patent number 9,687,454 before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board ("PTAB"). On 13 June 2019, the PTAB agreed to institute inter-partes review on one of the two petitions �led by the Company. The PTAB heard oral argument in the pending inter-partes review challenge on 3 March 2020.

On 2 June 2020, the PTAB issued a �nal written decision in the Company's favour �nding that the Company had demonstrated that claims 1-5, 7, and 9-14 of U.S. patent number 9,687,454 were unpatentable. The PTAB upheld the validity of only one of the challenged claims, claim 8. Additionally, claim 6 was not at issue in the inter-partes review and therefore not subject to the �nal written decision. Claims 6 and 8 remain asserted against the Company in the New Jersey District Court litigation. Indivior �led a timely notice of appeal of the PTAB's Final Written Decision (" FWD") for claims 1-5, 7, and 9-14, and the Company cross appealed the PTAB's FWD on claim 8. In the PTAB appeal, Indivior submitted its principal appeal brief on 9 December 2020. Indivior did not challenge the Board's decision on claims 5 and 12 in its appeal brief. The Company submitted its opening and response brief on 18 February 2021 and Indivior submitted its response and reply brief on 30 March 2021. The Company's reply brief was submitted on 20 April 2021. The court of appeals has not yet scheduled oral arguments in the appeal.

The Company intends to vigorously defend its positions and pursue a claim for damages caused by the preliminary injunction. Any liability that may arise on account of this litigation is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated �nancial statements of the Company.

## Matters relating to National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority

## Nor�oxacin, India litigation

The Company manufactures and distributes Nor�oxacin, a formulations product, and in limited quantities, the active pharmaceutical ingredient nor�oxacin. Under the Drugs (Prices Control) Order (the "DPCO"), the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (the "NPPA") established by the Government of India had the authority to designate a pharmaceutical product as a "speci�ed product" and �x the maximum selling price for such product. In 1995, the NPPA issued a noti�cation and designated Nor�oxacin as a "speci�ed product" and �xed the maximum selling price. In 1996, the Company �led a statutory Form III before the NPPA for the upward revision of the maximum selling price and a writ petition in the Andhra Pradesh High Court (the "High Court") challenging the validity of the designation on the grounds that the applicable rules of the DPCO were not complied with while �xing the maximum selling price. The High Court had previously granted an interim order in favour of the Company� however it subsequently dismissed the case in April 2004.

The Company �led a review petition in the High Court in April 2004 which was also dismissed by the High Court in October 2004. Subsequently, the Company appealed to the Supreme Court of India, New Delhi (the "Supreme Court") by �ling a Special Leave Petition.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

## 2.32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company received a notice from the NPPA demanding the recovery of the price charged by the Company for sales of Nor�oxacin in excess of the maximum selling price �xed by the NPPA, which was ' 285 including interest.

The Company �led a writ petition in the High Court challenging this demand order. The High Court admitted the writ petition and granted an interim order, directing the Company to deposit 50% of the principal amount claimed by the NPPA, which was ' 77. The Company deposited this amount with the NPPA in November 2005. In February 2008, the High Court directed the Company to deposit an additional amount of ' 30, which was deposited by the Company in March 2008. In November 2010, the High Court allowed the Company's application to include additional legal grounds that the Company believed strengthened its defense against the demand. For example, the Company added as grounds that trade margins should not be included in the computation of amounts overcharged, and that it was necessary for the NPPA to set the active pharmaceutical ingredient price before the process of determining the ceiling on the formulation price. In October 2013, the Company �led an additional writ petition before the Supreme Court challenging the inclusion of Nor�oxacin as a "speci�ed product" under the DPCO. In January 2015, the NPPA �led a counter a�davit stating that the inclusion of Nor�oxacin was based upon the recommendation of a committee consisting of experts in the �eld. On 20 July 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the matters concerning the inclusion of Nor�oxacin as a "speci�ed product" under the DPCO back to the High Court for further proceedings. During the three months ended 30 September 2016, the Supreme Court dismissed the Special Leave Petition pertaining to the �xing of prices for Nor�oxacin formulations.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, a writ petition pertaining to Nor�oxacin was �led by the Company with the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 29 July 2021 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision for potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the noti�ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

## Litigation relating to Cardiovascular and Anti-diabetic formulations

In July 2014, the NPPA, pursuant to the guidelines issued in May 2014 and the powers granted by the Government of India under the Drugs (Price Control) Order, 2013, issued certain noti�cations regulating the prices for 108 formulations in the cardiovascular and antidiabetic therapeutic areas. The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance ("IPA"), in which the Company is a member, �led a writ petition in the Bombay High Court challenging the noti�cations issued by the NPPA on the grounds that they were ultra vires, ex facie and ab initio void. The Bombay High Court issued an order to stay the writ in July 2014. On 26 September 2016, the Bombay High Court dismissed the writ petition �led by the IPA and upheld the validity of the noti�cations�orders passed by the NPPA in July 2014. Further, on 25 October 2016, the IPA �led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court, which was dismissed by the Supreme Court.

During the three months ended 31 December 2016, the NPPA issued show-cause notices relating to allegations that the Company exceeded the noti�ed maximum prices for 11 of its products. The Company has responded to these notices.

On 20 March 2017, the IPA �led an application before the Bombay High Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 26 September 2016. This recall application �led by the IPA was dismissed by the Bombay High Court on 4 October 2017. Further, on 13 December 2017, the IPA �led a Special Leave Petition with the Supreme Court for the recall of the judgement of the Bombay High Court dated 4 October 2017, which was dismissed by Supreme Court on 10 January 2018.

During the three months ended 31 March 2017, the NPPA issued notices to the Company demanding payments relating to the foregoing products for the allegedly overcharged amounts, along with interest. On 13 July 2017, in response to a writ petition which the Company had �led, the Delhi High Court set aside all the demand notices of the NPPA and directed the NPPA to provide a personal hearing to the Company and pass a speaking order. A personal hearing in this regard was held on 21 July 2017. On 27 July 2017, the NPPA passed a speaking order along with the demand notice directing the Company to pay an amount of ' 776. On 3 August 2017, the Company �led a writ petition challenging the speaking order and the demand notice. Upon hearing the matter on 8 August 2017, the Delhi High Court stayed the operation of the demand order and directed the Company to deposit ' 100 and furnish a bank guarantee for ' 676. Pursuant to the order, the Company deposited ' 100 on 13 September 2017 and submitted a bank guarantee of ' 676 dated 15 September 2017 to the Registrar General, Delhi High Court. On 22 November 2017, the Delhi High Court directed the Union of India to �le a �nal counter a�davit within six weeks, subsequent to which the Company could �le a rejoinder. On 10 May 2018, the counter a�davit was �led by the Union of India. The Company subsequently �led a rejoinder and both were taken on record by the Delhi High Court. The matter has been adjourned to 3 August 2021 for hearing.

Based on its best estimate, the Company has recorded a provision of ' 310 under "Selling, and other expenses" as a potential liability for sale proceeds in excess of the noti�ed selling prices, including the interest thereon, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of penalties pursuant to this litigation is not probable.

However, if the Company is unsuccessful in such litigation, it will be required to remit the sale proceeds in excess of the noti�ed selling prices to the Government of India with interest and could potentially include penalties, which amounts are not readily ascertainable.

## Other product and patent related matters

Child resistant packaging matter complaint under the False Claims Act ("FCA")

In May 2012, the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the "CPSC") requested that Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company in the United States, provide certain information with respect to compliance with requirements of special packaging for child resistant blister packs for 6 products sold by the Company in the United States during the period commencing in 2002 through 2011. The Company provided the requested information. The CPSC subsequently alleged in a letter dated 30 April 2014 that the Company had violated the Consumer Product Safety Act (the "CPSA") and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (the "PPPA") and that the CPSC intended to seek civil penalties. Speci�cally, the CPSC asserted, among other things, that from or about 14 August 2008 through 1 June 2012, the Company sold prescription drugs having unit dose packaging that failed to comply with the CPSC's special child resistant packaging regulations under the PPPA and failed to issue general certi�cates of conformance. In addition, the CPSC asserted that the Company violated the CPSA by failing to immediately advise the CPSC of the alleged violations. The Company disagrees with the CPSC's allegations.

## 2.32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

Simultaneously, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") began to investigate a sealed complaint which was �led in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under the Federal False Claims Act ("FCA") related to these same issues (the "FCA Complaint"). The Company cooperated with the DOJ in its investigation. The DOJ and all States involved in the investigation declined to intervene in the FCA Complaint. On 10 November 2015, the FCA Complaint was unsealed and the plainti� whistleblowers, who are two former employees of the Company, proceeded without the DOJ's and applicable States' involvement. The unsealed FCA Complaint relates to the 6 blister pack products originally subject to the investigation and also 38 of the Company's generic prescription products sold in the U.S. in various bottle and cap packaging.

The Company �led its response to the FCA Complaint on 23 February 2016 in the form of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On 26 March 2017, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss, dismissing the FCA Complaint and allowing the plainti�s one more chance to re�le this complaint in an attempt to plead sustainable allegations.

On 29 March 2017, the plainti�s �led their �nal amended FCA Complaint, which the Company opposed and during the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plainti�s �led a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

The parallel investigation by the CPSC under the CPSA and the PPPA was referred by the CPSC to the DOJ's o�ce in Washington, D.C. in April 2016, with the recommendation that the DOJ initiate a civil penalty action against the Company. The CPSC matter referred to the DOJ relates to �ve of the blister pack products.

On 18 January 2018, the Company and the DOJ entered into a settlement of the action and agreed to a consent decree providing for a civil penalty of US$5 million ( ' 319), and injunctive relief. The settlement was without adjudication of any issue of fact or law, and the Company has not admitted any violations of law pursuant to this settlement.

During the three months ended 31 March 2018, the Company obtained dismissal of the FCA Complaint with prejudice. The plainti�s subsequently �led a petition with the Court requesting that the Court reconsider its decision to dismiss the FCA Complaint with prejudice, and that request was denied.

In June 2018, the plainti�s �led their Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. During the three months ended September 2018, the plainti�s and the DOJ settled and thus this appeal was dismissed. The plainti�s then �led an application for recovery of attorneys� fees from the Company under the "alternative remedy doctrine." The Company made opposing �lings to this and in response the plainti�s withdrew their application.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability that may arise on account of the FCA Complaint is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated �nancial statements.

## Namenda Litigation

In August 2015, Sergeants Benevolent Assoc. Health &Welfare Fund ("Sergeants") �led suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Sergeants alleged that certain parties, including the Company, violated federal antitrust laws as a ® consequence of having settled patent litigation related to the Alzheimer's drug Namenda (memantine) tablets during a period from about 2009 ® until 2010. Sergeants seeks to represent a class of "end payor" purchasers of Namenda tablets (i.e., insurers, other third-party payors and consumers).

Sergeants seeks damages based upon an allegation made in the complaint that the defendants entered into patent settlements regarding ® Namenda tablets for the purpose of delaying generic competition and facilitating the brand innovator's attempt to shift sales from the original immediate release product to the more recently introduced extended release product.

On 23 August 2020, the Company and certain other defendants entered into a settlement agreement. The settlement agreement calls for the dismissal with prejudice of the claims brought by the plainti� on behalf of the putative class, in exchange for the payment of US$0.4 million. The Company paid that amount into escrow. The Court preliminarily approved the settlement on 5 October 2020. The settlement agreement is contingent upon �nal court approval. The settlement agreement explicitly disclaims any liability or wrongdoing.

Following the settlement agreement, the Company recognised such amount in the statement of pro�t and loss for the three months ended 30 September 2020.

On 5 November 2019 plainti�s MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC �led suit against the Company and other drug manufacturers in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The claims in this complaint were similar in nature to the claims in the Sergeants lawsuit, and those cases were coordinated for discovery purposes. On 14 April 2020, with the consent of the Company and the other defendants, plainti�s MSP Recovery Claims, Series LLC and MSPA Claims 1, LLC voluntarily dismissed their claims without prejudice.

Other class action complaints containing similar allegations to the Sergeants complaint have also been �led in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. However, apart from the Sergeants case described above, there are no such class actions that are pending and that name the Company as a defendant.

In addition, the State of New York �led an antitrust case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The case brought by the State of New York contained some (but not all) of the allegations set forth in the class action complaints, but the Company was not named as a party. The case brought by the State of New York was dismissed by stipulation on 30 November 2015.

The Company believes that the likelihood of any liability, apart from the settlement payment described above, that may arise on account of alleged violation of federal antitrust laws is not probable. Accordingly, no provision has been made in these consolidated �nancial statements.

## Ranitidine recall and Litigation

On 1 October 2019, the Company initiated a voluntary nationwide retail (at the retail level for over-the-counter products and at the consumer level for prescription products) of its ranitidine medications sold in the United States due to the presence of N-Nitrosodimethylamine ("NDMA") above levels established by the U.S. FDA. On 1 November 2019, the U.S. FDA issued a statement indicating that it had found levels of NDMA in ranitidine from its testing generally that were "similar to the levels you would expect to be exposed to if you ate common foods like grilled or smoked meats." See https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-new-testing-results-including-low-levels-impurities-ranitidine-drugs. On 1 April 2020, the U.S. FDA issued a press release announcing that it was requesting manufacturers to withdraw all prescription over-the-counter ranitidine drugs from the market immediately.

Individual federal court personal injury lawsuits, as well as various class actions, have been transferred to the In re Zantac (Ranitidine) Products Liability Litigation Multidistrict Litigation in the Southern District of Florida, MDL-2924 ("MDL-2924"). The Company and/or one or more of its U.S. subsidiaries have been named as a defendant in over 250 lawsuits pending in the MDL-2924. A census registry established in the MDL-2924 includes tens of thousands of claimants who have not �led complaints but are presenting claims for consideration in the MDL-2924 against the many pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors and retailers which are defendants in the MDL-2924. The MDL-2924 also involves a proposed nationwide consumer class action and a proposed nationwide class action for medical monitoring. A third-party payor class action was dismissed without prejudice and has been appealed by plainti�s to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

On 31 December 2020, the MDL-2924 Court ruled on multiple motions to dismiss in the MDL-2924 and granted the generic manufacturers' (the Company is a generic manufacturer) motion to dismiss based on federal preemption. The plainti�s' failure-to-warn and design defect claims against the Company were dismissed with prejudice, but the Court permitted plainti�s to attempt to replead several claims/theories. Plainti�s have �led their amended complaints and the defendants, including the Company, �led motions to dismiss seeking dismissal of all claims against them on 24 March 2021. The brie�ngs and arguments as to the latest round of motions to dismiss were completed and the parties are continue to engage in discovery consistent with orders from the MDL-2924 Court.

There are three ranitidine-related actions currently pending against the Company in state courts. The New Mexico State Attorney General �led suit against the Company's U.S. subsidiary, and multiple other manufacturers and retailers. The State of New Mexico asserted claims of statutory and common law public nuisance and negligence claims against the Company. The Company joined in an e�ort to transfer the case from the Santa Fe County Court to the MDL-2924, but the case was remanded by the MDL-2924 Court to the Santa Fe County Court. Plainti� �led an amended complaint on 16 April 2021, and a brie�ng schedule has been entered pursuant to which the defendants will move to dismiss the case.

In November 2020, the City of Baltimore �led a similar action against the Company's U.S. subsidiary, and multiple other manufacturers and retailers. The City of Baltimore asserts public nuisance and negligence claims against the Company. The City of Baltimore action also was transferred to the MDL and subsequently was remanded to the Circuit Court of Maryland by the MDL Court. The City of Baltimore intends to �le an amended complaint and the defendants will then move to dismiss the case.

In January 2021, the Company was served in a Proposition 65 case �led by the Center for Environmental Health in the Superior Court of Alameda County, California. The plainti� purports to bring the case on behalf of the people of California and alleges that the Company violated Proposition 65, a California law requiring manufacturers to disclose the presence of carcinogens in consumer products. The Company and other defendants have �led demurrers (motions to dismiss) in the case, and on 7 May 2021 the Court granted all such demurrers without leave to amend the pleadings. The People of California have the right to appeal this decision.

The Company believes that all of the aforesaid complaints and asserted claims are without merit and it denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable at this time. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated �nancial statements of the Company.

## Class Action and Other Civil Litigation on Pricing/Reimbursement Matters

On 30 December 2015 and on 4 February 2016, respectively, a class action complaint (the "First Pricing Complaint") and another complaint (not a class action) (the "Second Pricing Complaint") were �led against the Company and eighteen other pharmaceutical defendants in State Court in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In these actions, the class action plainti�s allege that the Company and other defendants, individually or in some cases in concert with one another, have engaged in pricing and price reporting practices in violation of various Pennsylvania state laws. More speci�cally, the plainti�s allege that: (1) the Company provided false and misleading pricing information to third party drug compendia companies for the Company's generic drugs, and such information was relied upon by private third party payers that reimbursed for drugs sold by the Company in the United States, and (2) the Company acted in concert with certain other defendants to unfairly raise the prices of generic divalproex sodium ER (bottle of 80, 500 mg tablets ER 24H) and generic pravastatin sodium (bottle of 500, 10 mg tablets).

The First Pricing Complaint was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the "E.D.P.A. Federal Court") and, pending the outcome of the First Pricing Complaint, the Second Pricing Complaint was stayed. On 25 September 2017, the E.D.P.A. Federal Court dismissed all the claims of the plainti�s in the First Pricing Complaint and denied leave to amend such complaint as futile. Subsequent to this decision, the plainti�s' right to appeal the dismissal of the First Pricing Complaint expired.

Further, on 17 November 2016, certain class action complaints were �led against the Company and a number of other pharmaceutical companies as defendants in the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. Subsequently, these complaints were consolidated into one amended complaint as part multi-district, multi product litigation pending with the E.D.P.A. Federal Court. These complaints allege that the Company and the other named defendants have engaged in a conspiracy to �x prices and to allocate bids and customers in the sale of pravastatin sodium tablets and divalproex sodium extended-release tablets in the United States.

In March 2017, plainti�s agreed by stipulation to dismiss Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Inc. and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited from the actions related to pravastatin sodium tablets without prejudice. The Company denies any wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend against these allegations.

## 2.32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

In response to the consolidated new complaint, the Company �led a motion to dismiss in October 2017. The plainti�s �led opposition to the motion to dismiss in December 2017 and a reply was �led by the Company in January 2018. In October 2018, the Court denied the motion to dismiss on the grounds that the allegations pled leave open the possibility of conspiracy. Therefore, discovery will proceed to look into this possibility.

The Company believes that the asserted claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations. Also any liability that may arise on account of these claims is unascertainable. Accordingly, no provision was made in these consolidated �nancial statements of the Company.

These 87 plainti�s had been previously encompassed by the End Payor Plainti� class actions in the MDL-2724. Only a Praecipe of Writ of Summons has been �led. No complaint has been �led and, therefore, the potential claims have not been asserted or delineated in any manner, including what drugs any such claims may relate to. A complaint may, at some point, be �led encompassing the claims asserted by the End Payor Plainti�s in the MDL-2724 actions. On 12 December 2019, an Order of the Court of Common Pleas placed the matter "in Deferred Status Pending Further Developments in Related Federal Multidistrict Litigation." Because no Complaint has been �led setting forth any claims, and because the action has been placed into Deferred Status, no response is required by the Company's subsidiary at this time.

Ltd. and Mezzion International LLC (collectively, "Mezzion") �led a complaint in the New Jersey Superior Court against the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary in the United States.

Mezzion alleges that the Company failed to comply with the U.S. FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") at the time of manufacture of the API and �nished dosage forms of udena�l and, consequently, that this resulted in a delay in the �ling of a NDA for the product by Mezzion.

## (iii) Civil Litigation and Arbitration with Hatchtech Pty Limited

On 7 September 2015, the Company's Swiss subsidiary, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, S.A., entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA") with ® Hatchtech Pty Limited ("Hatchtech"). Pursuant to the APA, the Company's subsidiary acquired from Hatchtech the patented product Xeglyze , a topical lousicidal lotion for the treatment of head lice, and all rights in the product. The APA provides that the Company would seek to obtain New Drug Application ("NDA") approval from the U.S. FDA, and would then commercialize the product in the United States. The APA speci�es certain milestone payments to be paid by the Company's Swiss subsidiary to Hatchtech, including a US$ 20 million NDA approval milestone payment, a US$ 25 million ovicidal label approval milestone payment, and certain net sales milestone payments.

® On 24 July 2020, the Company received the NDA approval from the US FDA for the Xeglyze product.

On 25 September 2020, the Company's Swiss subsidiary �led an action in Delaware Chancery Court against Hatchtech to rescind the APA based ® upon claims of fraud, negligent misrepresentations and mutual mistake in connection with the acquisition of the product Xeglyze , which was dismissed as being untimely under the Delaware statute of limitations.

On 8 October 2020, Hatchtech �led an arbitration demand against the Swiss Subsidiary before the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), International Center for Dispute Resolution ("ICDR"), in New York City, claiming that it was owed US$ 20 million for the NDA approval milestone and US$ 25 million for the ovicidal label approval milestone.

On 25 January 2021, the Company's Swiss subsidiary �led a �rit of Summons and Statement of Claim in �ictoria at Melbourne, Australia, against Hatchtech (as a nominal party), certain of its o�cers and a principal shareholder, alleging misrepresentations in connection with the acquisition of ® the Xeglyze product and seeking damages and other relief.

Based on its best estimate, the Company had recorded a provision for potential liability of US$ 20 million relating to the AAA-ICDR arbitration �led by Hatchtech and believed that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise pursuant to that arbitration to be not probable.

On 14 June 2021, the Company received the arbitration decision and award issued by the AAA-ICDR in favour of Hatchtech in an amount of US$ 46.25 million towards milestone payments, interest and fees.

As this constitutes an adjusting subsequent event, the consolidated �nancial statements for the year ended 31 March 2021 were adjusted to re�ect the impact of this event by recognising the balance amount of US$ 26.25 million in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss.

Of the total amount of US$ 46.25 million awarded to Hatchtech, the amount of US$ 45 million ( ' 3,291) was recognised in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss under the heading "Impairment of non-current assets" and the balance of US$ 1.25 million ( ' 91) was recognised under the heading, "Selling and general expenses".

## (iv) Securities Class Action Litigation

On 25 August 2017, a securities class action lawsuit was �led against the Company, its Chief Executive O�cer and its Chief Financial O�cer in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company's Co-Chairman, its Chief Operating O�cer, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., were also subsequently named as defendants in the case. The operative complaint alleges that the Company made false or misleading statements or omissions in its public �lings, in violation of U.S. federal securities laws, and that the Company's share price dropped and its investors were a�ected. On 9 May 2018, the Company and other defendants �led a motion to dismiss the complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

On 25 June 2018, the plainti�s �led an opposition to the motion to dismiss and, on 25 July 2018, a further reply in support of the motion to dismiss was �led by the Company. In August 2018, oral argument on the motion to dismiss was heard by the Court.

On 21 March 2019, the District Court issued its decision granting in part and denying in part the motion to dismiss. Pursuant to that decision, the Court dismissed the plainti�s claims with respect to seventeen out of the twenty two alleged misstatements and omissions.

On 15 May 2020, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Limited, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, Inc., and certain of the Company's current or former directors and o�cers have entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement (the "Stipulation") with lead plainti� the Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi in the putative securities class action �led against the defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. As consideration for the settlement of the class action, the Company has agreed to pay US$9 million.

The settlement is subject to the approval of the court and may be terminated prior to court approval pursuant to the grounds for termination set forth in the Stipulation. Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the settlement consideration, lead plainti� and members of the settlement class who do not opt-out of this settlement would release, among other things, the claims that were asserted, or that they could have asserted, in this class action.

In entering into the settlement, the defendants do not admit, and explicitly deny, any liability or wrongdoing of any kind.

Subject to the terms of the Stipulation, the settlement resolves the remainder of the litigation.

As the Company is adequately insured with respect to the aforesaid liability, the settlement did not have any impact on the Company's consolidated statement of pro�t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2020.

The amount payable to the plainti�s on account of the settlement and the corresponding receivable from the insurer have been presented under "other current �nancial assets" and "other current �nancial liabilities", respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as at 31 March 2020.

On 23 December 2020, the court issued a �nal order and judgement approving the settlement. Pursuant to the settlement/court order, the escrow was funded on 4 January 2021. The e�ective date of the settlement occurred on 1 February 2021, upon transfer of the settlement fund balance into the �nal escrow account. As the transfer of funds to the �nal escrow account constitutes settlement of liability, the amount of liability has been derecognised during the three months ended 31 March 2021.

## (v) Internal Investigation

The Company has commenced a detailed investigation into an anonymous complaint. The complaint alleges that healthcare professionals in Ukraine and potentially in other countries were provided with improper payments by or on behalf of the Company in violation anti-corruption laws, speci�cally the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

The Company has disclosed the matter to the US Department of Justice, Securities and Exchange Commission and Securities Exchange Board of India. While the matter may result in government enforcement actions against the Company in the United States and/or foreign jurisdictions, which could lead to civil and criminal sanctions under relevant laws, the probability of such action and the outcome are not reasonably ascertainable at this time.

## (vii) Environmental matters

## Land pollution

The Indian Council for Environmental Legal Action �led a writ in 1989 under Article 32 of the Constitution of India against the Union of India and others in the Supreme Court of India for the safety of people living in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas of Medak district of the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh. The Company has been named in the list of polluting industries. In 1996, the Andhra Pradesh District Judge proposed that the polluting industries compensate farmers in the Patancheru, Bollaram and Jeedimetla areas for discharging e�uents which damaged the farmers' agricultural land. The compensation was �xed at ' 0.0013 per acre for dry land and ' 0.0017 per acre for wet land. Accordingly, the Company has paid a total compensation of ' 3. The Andhra Pradesh High Court disposed of the writ petition on 12 February 2013 and transferred the case to the National Green Tribunal ("NGT"), Chennai, India. The interim orders passed in the writ petitions will continue until the matter is decided by the NGT. The NGT has, through its order dated 30 October 2015, constituted a Fact Finding Committee.

The NGT has also permitted the alleged polluting industries to appoint a person on their behalf in the Fact Finding Committee. However, the Company, along with the alleged polluting industries, has challenged the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee. The NGT has directed that until all the applications challenging the constitution and composition of the Fact Finding Committee are disposed of, the Fact Finding Committee shall not commence its operation.

The NGT, Chennai in a judgement dated 24 October 2017, disposed of the matter. The Bulk Drug Manufacturers Association of India ("BDMAI"), in which the Company is a member, subsequently �led a review petition against the judgement on various aspects.

The NGT, Delhi, in a judgement dated 16 November 2017 in another case in which the Company is not a party, stated that the moratorium imposed in the Patancheru and Bollaram areas shall continue until the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change passes an order keeping in view the needs of the environment and public health. The Company �led an appeal challenging this judgement.

The High Court of Hyderabad heard the Company's appeal challenging this judgement in July 2018 and directed the respondents to �le their response within a period of four weeks. During the three months ended 30 September 2018, the respondents �led counter a�davits and the matter has now been adjourned for �nal hearing.

The appeal came up for hearing before the High Court of Hyderabad on 25 October 2018 and has been adjourned for further hearing.

On 24 April 2019, based upon the judgement of the NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017, the Government of Telangana has issued GO.Ms. No. 24 of 2019 that allows for expansion of production of all kinds of existing industrial units located within the stretch of Patancheru - Bollaram upon depositing an amount equivalent to 1% of the annual turnover of the respective unit for the concluded �scal year i.e., 31 March 2019. Accordingly, the Company made a provision of ' 29.4, representing the probable cost of expansion, during the year ended 31 March 2019.

During the three months ended 30 September 2019, the Telangana State Pollution Control Board ("TSPCB") has issued Operational Guidelines basis the NGT, Chennai Order dated 24 October 2017, G.O.Ms. No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms. No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and sought to recover retrospectively an amount of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the �scal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 for all the industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram for the purposes of restoration of the said e�ected area. The Company has four industrial units situated in Patancheru and Bollaram. The Consent For Operation ("CFO") for change of product mix application �led by one of the industrial unit of the Company has been recommended for issuance of CFO with change of product mix only upon payment of 0.5% of the annual turnover from the �scal years 2016-2017 to 2018-2019 to the TSPCB. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the Operational Guidelines.

In November 2019, demand notices were issued by the TSPCB for collection of Corpus Fund of 0.5 % as remediation fee on the previous year turnover as per Operational Guidelines dated 3 August 2019 issued by TSPCB under the guise of G.O.Ms No. 24 dated 24 April 2019 and G.O.Ms No. 31 dated 24 May 2019 and basis the judgement of NGT, Chennai dated 24 October 2017 for the �scal years 2015-2016 to 2018-2019 received by CTO-1, CTO-2 and CTO-3 of the Company.

On 22 November 2019, The Hon'ble High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued an Interim Order which stayed the demand on the condition that the Company deposit ' 60 as the remediation fee for the �scal year 2018-2019 payable in the �scal year 2019-2020. The deposit of ' 60 was made and the Interim Order is continuing. The matter was adjourned to 22 April 2020 but has been delayed as a result of the closure of the Court due to the COVID-19 lockdown, and a new date has not yet been rescheduled.

The Company believes that any additional liability that might arise in this regard is not probable. Accordingly, no provision relating to these claims has been made in the �nancial statements.

## Water pollution and air pollution

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Company, along with 14 other companies, received a notice from the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board (the "APP Control Board") to show cause as to why action should not be initiated against them for violations under the Indian Water Pollution Act and the Indian Air Pollution Act. Furthermore, the APP Control Board issued orders to the Company to (i) stop production of all new products at the Company's manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad, India without obtaining a "Consent for Establishment", (ii) cease manufacturing products at such facilities in excess of certain quantities speci�ed by the APP Control Board and (iii) furnish a bank guarantee to assure compliance with the APP Control Board's orders.

(All amounts in Indian Rupees millions, except share data and per share data)

## 2.32 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS (CONTINUED)

The Company appealed the APP Control Board orders to the Andhra Pradesh Pollution Appellate Board (the "APP Appellate Board"). The APP Appellate Board, on the basis of a report of a fact-�nding advisory committee, recommended to the Andhra Pradesh Government to allow expansion of units fully equipped with Zero-Liquid Discharge ("ZLD") facilities and otherwise found no fault with the Company (on certain conditions).

The APP Appellate Board's decision was challenged by one of the petitioners that was pending in the National Green Tribunal, (the "NGT"), Delhi.

Separately, the Andhra Pradesh Government, following recommendations of the APP Appellate Board, published a noti�cation in July 2013 that allowed expansion of production of all types of existing bulk drug and bulk drug intermediate manufacturing units subject to the installation of ZLD facilities and the outcome of cases pending in the NGT. Importantly, the noti�cation directed pollution load of industrial units to be assessed at the point of discharge (if any) as opposed to the point of generation.

In September 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Forests, based on the revised Comprehensive Environment Pollution Index, issued a noti�cation that re-imposed a moratorium on expansion of industries in certain areas where some of the Company's manufacturing facilities are located. This noti�cation overrides the Andhra Pradesh Government's noti�cation that conditionally permitted expansion.

The appeals �led by Mr. �. Chidambaram against the Orders of the Appellate Authority, Andhra Pradesh are disposed o� as the same do not survive for consideration as the G.O. based on which the then APPCB had passed its order which was subject matter of appeal before the Appellate Authority has itself been amended vide order 25 July 2013. However, the NGT, Delhi has passed a direction for the issue of pollution to be considered by the Joint Committee of Central Pollution Control Board, National Environmental Engineering Institute ("NEERI"), and the Telangana State Pollution Control Board to ascertain the present status of pollution issues in the Medak, Ranga Reddy, Mahaboobnagar and Nalagonda districts in the State of Telangana particularly in the Patancheru and Bollaram industrial clusters and �le a report within three months before the NGT, Delhi.

## (viii) Fuel Surcharge Adjustments

The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the "APERC") passed various orders approving the levy of Fuel Surcharge Adjustment ("FSA") charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 by power distribution companies from all the consumers of electricity in the then existing undivided state of Andhra Pradesh, India where the Company's headquarters and principal manufacturing facilities are located. Separate writ petitions �led by the Company for various periods, challenging and questioning the validity and legality of this levy of FSA charges by the APERC, are pending before the High Court of Andhra Pradesh and the Supreme Court of India.

The total amount approved by APERC for collection by the power distribution companies from the Company in respect of FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2008 to 31 March 2013 is ' 482. After taking into account all of the available information and legal provisions, the Company has recorded ' 219 as the potential liability towards FSA charges. However, the Company has paid, under protest, an amount of ' 354 as demanded by the power distribution companies as part of monthly electricity bills. The Company remains exposed to additional �nancial liability should the orders passed by the APERC be upheld by the Courts.

During the three months ended 30 June 2016, the Supreme Court of India dismissed the Special Leave Petition �led by the Company in this regard for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013. As a result, for the quarter ended 30 June 2016, the Company recognised an expenditure of ' 55 (by de-recognising the payments under protest) representing the FSA charges for the period from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2013.

The Company has recorded a provision of ' 51 as on 31 March 2021, and believes that the likelihood of any further liability that may arise on account of the ongoing litigation is not probable.

| PARTICULARS                                                          | AMOUNT   |

| Total consideration                                                  | ������   |
| Assets acquired                                                      |          |
| Goodwill                                                             | ���      |

| Inventories                                                          | ���      |
| Other assets                                                         | ���      |
| Liabilities assumed                                                  |          |
| Employee bene�ts (Gratuity -  ' 70 and compensated absences-  '  75) | (���)    |

| Total net assets                                                     | ������   |

The total goodwill of ' 530 consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the acquired business, together with the value of the workforce acquired. The entire amount of goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs amounted to ' 60 and were excluded from the consideration transferred and were recognised as expense under "Selling and other expenses" in the Statement of pro�t or loss for the year ended 31 March 2021.

The fair value of the contingent consideration of ' 561 was estimated by applying the income approach. The fair value measurement is based on signi�cant inputs that are not observable in the market, which Ind AS 13, "Fair �alue Measurement" refers to as �evel 3 inputs. The signi�cant unobservable inputs in the valuation is the estimated sales forecast. During the three months ended 31 March 2021, the Company, after taking into account the revenue of the products until twelve months post-closing (9 June 2021), re-measured the contingent consideration to ' 420.

The amount of revenue included in the consolidated statement of pro�t and loss for the year ended 31 March 2021 pertaining to the acquired business since 10 June 2020 is ' 3,887.

The acquired business has been integrated into the Company's existing activities and it is not practicable to identify the impact on the Company pro�t in the year.
